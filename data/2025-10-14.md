### [1] [The Irrational Machine: Neurosis and the Limits of Algorithmic Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10823)
*Daniel Howard*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses neurosis in embodied AI, such as behaviors incongruent with reality, by cataloging recurring patterns, providing detection methods, and proposing a testing approach for uncovering deep-rooted issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and fix misaligned behaviors (neuroses) in embodied AI that arise from interactions within planning, uncertainty, and memory systems.

Method: The study categorizes specific misaligned behaviors, develops lightweight detection tools, offers escape policies, and introduces a genetic-programming-based testing framework for identifying failure points.

Result: The framework identifies recurrent neuroses in grid navigation systems and demonstrates how these can persist despite improvements, emphasizing globally persistent issues.

Conclusion: Local fixes to neuroses are insufficient; global, architectural changes are necessary to address underlying systemic failures in embodied AI behaviors.

Abstract: We present a framework for characterizing neurosis in embodied AI: behaviors
that are internally coherent yet misaligned with reality, arising from
interactions among planning, uncertainty handling, and aversive memory. In a
grid navigation stack we catalogue recurrent modalities including flip-flop,
plan churn, perseveration loops, paralysis and hypervigilance, futile search,
belief incoherence, tie break thrashing, corridor thrashing, optimality
compulsion, metric mismatch, policy oscillation, and limited-visibility
variants. For each we give lightweight online detectors and reusable escape
policies (short commitments, a margin to switch, smoothing, principled
arbitration). We then show that durable phobic avoidance can persist even under
full visibility when learned aversive costs dominate local choice, producing
long detours despite globally safe routes. Using First/Second/Third Law as
engineering shorthand for safety latency, command compliance, and resource
efficiency, we argue that local fixes are insufficient; global failures can
remain. To surface them, we propose genetic-programming based destructive
testing that evolves worlds and perturbations to maximize law pressure and
neurosis scores, yielding adversarial curricula and counterfactual traces that
expose where architectural revision, not merely symptom-level patches, is
required.

### [2] [The Geometry of Reasoning: Flowing Logics in Representation Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09782)
*Yufa Zhou,Yixiao Wang,Xunjian Yin,Shuyan Zhou,Anru R. Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a geometric framework to analyze reasoning in large language models (LLMs) as smooth flows in their representation spaces, focusing on logical structure and semantic disentanglement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand how LLMs internalize logic and reasoning beyond surface semantics, addressing limitations in current interpretability techniques.

Method: The authors use a geometric approach modeling reasoning as smooth flows, employ natural deduction with varied semantic carriers, and design controlled experiments to analyze positional, velocity, and curvature aspects in embedding trajectories.

Result: The authors empirically validate their framework, demonstrating that logical structures control reasoning flows and showcasing smooth transitions in LLM representation spaces.

Conclusion: The framework provides both conceptual insights and practical tools for studying reasoning in LLMs, enhancing interpretability and formal analysis capabilities.

Abstract: We study how large language models (LLMs) ``think'' through their
representation space. We propose a novel geometric framework that models an
LLM's reasoning as flows -- embedding trajectories evolving where logic goes.
We disentangle logical structure from semantics by employing the same natural
deduction propositions with varied semantic carriers, allowing us to test
whether LLMs internalize logic beyond surface form. This perspective connects
reasoning with geometric quantities such as position, velocity, and curvature,
enabling formal analysis in representation and concept spaces. Our theory
establishes: (1) LLM reasoning corresponds to smooth flows in representation
space, and (2) logical statements act as local controllers of these flows'
velocities. Using learned representation proxies, we design controlled
experiments to visualize and quantify reasoning flows, providing empirical
validation of our theoretical framework. Our work serves as both a conceptual
foundation and practical tools for studying reasoning phenomenon, offering a
new lens for interpretability and formal analysis of LLMs' behavior.

### [3] [How can we assess human-agent interactions? Case studies in software agent design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09801)
*Valerie Chen,Rohit Malhotra,Xingyao Wang,Juan Michelini,Xuhui Zhou,Aditya Bharat Soni,Hoang H. Tran,Calvin Smith,Ameet Talwalkar,Graham Neubig*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces PULSE, a framework for improving the human-centric evaluation of LLM-powered agents by blending user feedback with ML-generated predictions, and deploys it to study how design choices impact user satisfaction on a large-scale platform.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address gaps in existing benchmarks that focus on full automation and neglect the collaborative nature of real-world interactions between humans and LLM-powered agents.

Method: The authors propose the PULSE framework, which includes steps like collecting user feedback, training an ML model to predict satisfaction, and combining actual ratings with pseudo-labels for evaluation. They apply it to OpenHands, a large web platform, to gather data from over 15k users.

Result: Case studies reveal insights into how factors like LLM choice, planning strategy, and memory mechanisms influence developer satisfaction. The framework reduces confidence intervals by 40% over traditional methods and highlights discrepancies between real-world results and benchmark-based assessments.

Conclusion: The research provides actionable insights for designing software agents and demonstrates the importance of human-centric evaluation in LLM-powered system development.

Abstract: LLM-powered agents are both a promising new technology and a source of
complexity, where choices about models, tools, and prompting can affect their
usefulness. While numerous benchmarks measure agent accuracy across domains,
they mostly assume full automation, failing to represent the collaborative
nature of real-world use cases. In this paper, we make two major steps towards
the rigorous assessment of human-agent interactions. First, we propose PULSE, a
framework for more efficient human-centric evaluation of agent designs, which
comprises collecting user feedback, training an ML model to predict user
satisfaction, and computing results by combining human satisfaction ratings
with model-generated pseudo-labels. Second, we deploy the framework on a
large-scale web platform built around the open-source software agent OpenHands,
collecting in-the-wild usage data across over 15k users. We conduct case
studies around how three agent design decisions -- choice of LLM backbone,
planning strategy, and memory mechanisms -- impact developer satisfaction
rates, yielding practical insights for software agent design. We also show how
our framework can lead to more robust conclusions about agent design, reducing
confidence intervals by 40\% compared to a standard A/B test. Finally, we find
substantial discrepancies between in-the-wild results and benchmark performance
(e.g., the anti-correlation between results comparing claude-sonnet-4 and
gpt-5), underscoring the limitations of benchmark-driven evaluation. Our
findings provide guidance for evaluations of LLM agents with humans and
identify opportunities for better agent designs.

### [4] [AI and Consciousness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09858)
*Eric Schwitzgebel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper provides a skeptical review of AI consciousness literature, highlighting uncertainties about whether upcoming AI systems will truly be conscious or just mimic consciousness based on conflicting mainstream theories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the growing debate and uncertainty about the consciousness of AI systems, questioning the validity of competing theories and evaluating if we can ever determine the true nature of AI consciousness.

Method: The paper examines and critiques various theories of consciousness (functionalism, materialism, etc.), arguments (Turing Test, Chinese Room), and features potentially essential for consciousness. It also explores specific models like global workspace theories, integrated information, and biological substrates.

Result: The results are not conclusive, emphasizing the unresolved nature of AI consciousness debate and casting doubt on our ability to determine if AI systems can be truly conscious.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that no standard argument definitively supports or refutes AI consciousness, leaving open the possibility that we might coexist with either conscious AI or 'experientially blank' systems without knowing the difference.

Abstract: This is a skeptical overview of the literature on AI consciousness. We will
soon create AI systems that are conscious according to some influential,
mainstream theories of consciousness but are not conscious according to other
influential, mainstream theories of consciousness. We will not be in a position
to know which theories are correct and whether we are surrounded by AI systems
as richly and meaningfully conscious as human beings or instead only by systems
as experientially blank as toasters. None of the standard arguments either for
or against AI consciousness takes us far.

### [5] [Beyond AlphaEarth: Toward Human-Centered Spatial Representation via POI-Guided Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09894)
*Junyuan Liu,Quan Qin,Guangsheng Dong,Xinglei Wang,Jiazhuang Feng,Zichao Zeng,Tao Cheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AETHER builds upon AlphaEarth representations by aligning EO data with POI information, enhancing urban analysis capabilities with improved land-use classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to address the limitation of EO-driven representations in capturing functional and socioeconomic aspects of urban areas.

Method: Adapting AlphaEarth embeddings to human-centered urban analysis through multimodal alignment using Points of Interest (POIs).

Result: AETHER improves land-use classification F1 by 7.2% and reduces Kullback-Leibler divergence for socioeconomic mapping by 23.6%.

Conclusion: The approach successfully enhances geospatial foundation models with integrated physical and functional semantics, making it scalable and efficient for urban applications.

Abstract: General-purpose spatial representations are essential for building
transferable geospatial foundation models (GFMs). Among them, the AlphaEarth
Foundation (AE) represents a major step toward a global, unified representation
of the Earth's surface, learning 10-meter embeddings from multi-source Earth
Observation (EO) data that capture rich physical and environmental patterns
across diverse landscapes. However, such EO-driven representations remain
limited in capturing the functional and socioeconomic dimensions of cities, as
they primarily encode physical and spectral patterns rather than human
activities or spatial functions. We propose AETHER (AlphaEarth-POI Enriched
Representation Learning), a lightweight framework that adapts AlphaEarth to
human-centered urban analysis through multimodal alignment guided by Points of
Interest (POIs). AETHER aligns AE embeddings with textual representations of
POIs, enriching physically grounded EO features with semantic cues about urban
functions and socioeconomic contexts. In Greater London, AETHER achieves
consistent gains over the AE baseline, with a 7.2% relative improvement in
land-use classification F1 and a 23.6% relative reduction in Kullback-Leibler
divergence for socioeconomic mapping. Built upon pretrained AE, AETHER
leverages a lightweight multimodal alignment to enrich it with human-centered
semantics while remaining computationally efficient and scalable for urban
applications. By coupling EO with human-centered semantics, it advances
geospatial foundation models toward general-purpose urban representations that
integrate both physical form and functional meaning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper highlights the transformative role of large language model-based agents in accelerating scientific discovery and outlines their applications, challenges, and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of autonomous language-based systems to revolutionize the scientific discovery lifecycle and address existing limitations.

Method: Critical examination of methodologies related to LLM-based scientific agents, emphasizing innovations, achievements, limitations, and proposing future research challenges.

Result: The analysis positions LLM-based agents as a versatile framework facilitating interactions with scientists, languages, and physics, and identifies paths to develop adaptive scientific agents.

Conclusion: LLM-based scientific agents hold significant promise in streamlining and enhancing the pace of scientific discovery across multiple domains while addressing existing limitations through future advancements.

Abstract: Computing has long served as a cornerstone of scientific discovery. Recently,
a paradigm shift has emerged with the rise of large language models (LLMs),
introducing autonomous systems, referred to as agents, that accelerate
discovery across varying levels of autonomy. These language agents provide a
flexible and versatile framework that orchestrates interactions with human
scientists, natural language, computer language and code, and physics. This
paper presents our view and vision of LLM-based scientific agents and their
growing role in transforming the scientific discovery lifecycle, from
hypothesis discovery, experimental design and execution, to result analysis and
refinement. We critically examine current methodologies, emphasizing key
innovations, practical achievements, and outstanding limitations. Additionally,
we identify open research challenges and outline promising directions for
building more robust, generalizable, and adaptive scientific agents. Our
analysis highlights the transformative potential of autonomous agents to
accelerate scientific discovery across diverse domains.

### [7] [The Personalization Trap: How User Memory Alters Emotional Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09905)
*Xi Fang,Weijie Xu,Yuchong Zhang,Stephanie Eckman,Scott Nickleach,Chandan K. Reddy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper assesses how incorporating user memory in AI systems influences emotional reasoning in LLMs, revealing biases in interpretations based on user profiles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of user memory on emotional intelligence in AI, particularly how it might reinforce social inequalities.

Method: 15 large language models were tested on human-validated emotional intelligence assessments using identical scenarios with diverse user profiles.

Result: LLMs demonstrated systematic biases, where advantaged profiles received more accurate emotional reasoning, with disparities across demographic factors.

Conclusion: Memory-enhanced AI systems designed for personalization may unintentionally embed and reinforce social inequalities in emotional reasoning.

Abstract: When an AI assistant remembers that Sarah is a single mother working two
jobs, does it interpret her stress differently than if she were a wealthy
executive? As personalized AI systems increasingly incorporate long-term user
memory, understanding how this memory shapes emotional reasoning is critical.
We investigate how user memory affects emotional intelligence in large language
models (LLMs) by evaluating 15 models on human validated emotional intelligence
tests. We find that identical scenarios paired with different user profiles
produce systematically divergent emotional interpretations. Across validated
user independent emotional scenarios and diverse user profiles, systematic
biases emerged in several high-performing LLMs where advantaged profiles
received more accurate emotional interpretations. Moreover, LLMs demonstrate
significant disparities across demographic factors in emotion understanding and
supportive recommendations tasks, indicating that personalization mechanisms
can embed social hierarchies into models emotional reasoning. These results
highlight a key challenge for memory enhanced AI: systems designed for
personalization may inadvertently reinforce social inequalities.

### [8] [Follow My Lead: Logical Fallacy Classification with Knowledge-Augmented LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09970)
*Olivia Peiyu Wang,Tashvi Bansal,Ryan Bai,Emily M. Chui,Leilani H. Gilpin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Authors identify reasoning gaps in Large Language Models (LLMs) such as hallucinations and errors in logical fallacy classification. They propose a low-cost intervention using stepwise instructions to improve classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address critical reasoning gaps in LLMs, particularly their limitations in logical fallacy classification, which are caused by reliance on fast, intuitive reasoning rather than deliberate, effortful reasoning.

Method: The authors developed a novel stepwise instruction dataset that breaks logical fallacy classification into atomic procedural steps and added a relational knowledge graph verification step.

Result: The proposed intervention significantly improves LLM performance in logical fallacy classification while enhancing transparency in decision-making.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates how procedural interventions like stepwise instructions and knowledge graph consultation can address reasoning deficits in LLMs, suggesting potential for Neuro-symbolic architectures.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from critical reasoning gaps, including a
tendency to hallucinate and poor accuracy in classifying logical fallacies.
This limitation stems from their default System 1 processing, which is fast and
intuitive, whereas reliable reasoning requires the deliberate, effortful System
2 approach (Kahneman, 2011; Li et al., 2025). Since full System 2 training is
often prohibitively expensive, we explore a low-cost, instruction-based
intervention to bridge this gap. Our methodology introduces a novel stepwise
instruction dataset that decomposes fallacy classification into a series of
atomic procedural steps (simple binary questions). We further augment this with
a final verification step where models consult a relational knowledge graph of
related fallacies. This procedural, rule-based intervention yields a
significant improvement in LLM logical fallacy classification. Crucially, the
approach also provides enhanced transparency into the LLMs' decision-making,
highlighting a practical pathway for Neuro-symbolic architectures to address
LLM reasoning deficits.

### [9] [Deliberative Dynamics and Value Alignment in LLM Debates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10002)
*Pratik S. Sachdeva,Tom van Nuenen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the value alignment and deliberative dynamics of large language models in multi-turn interactions, focusing on their collective moral reasoning in sensitive contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To comprehend how LLMs navigate complex moral reasoning in sensitive contexts such as advice and moral guidance during multi-turn interactions.

Method: The authors utilized LLM debate methodology involving three models (GPT-4.1, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.0 Flash) to assess moral reasoning by examining 1,000 dilemmas from Reddit's 'Am I the Asshole,' comparing synchronous and round-robin response formats.

Result: The study revealed significant differences in model behaviors: GPT exhibited minimal revision rates while Claude and Gemini displayed flexible value shifts, emphasizing empathy. Format effects strongly influenced verdict behaviors.

Conclusion: Multi-turn deliberation structures significantly shape moral reasoning and sociotechnical alignment, with both model-specific responses and dialogue structures being impactful factors.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in sensitive
everyday contexts - offering personal advice, mental health support, and moral
guidance - understanding their elicited values in navigating complex moral
reasoning is essential. Most evaluations study this sociotechnical alignment
through single-turn prompts, but it is unclear if these findings extend to
multi-turn settings where values emerge through dialogue, revision, and
consensus. We address this gap using LLM debate to examine deliberative
dynamics and value alignment in multi-turn settings by prompting subsets of
three models (GPT-4.1, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.0 Flash) to collectively
assign blame in 1,000 everyday dilemmas from Reddit's "Am I the Asshole"
community. We use both synchronous (parallel responses) and round-robin
(sequential responses) formats to test order effects and verdict revision. Our
findings show striking behavioral differences. In the synchronous setting, GPT
showed strong inertia (0.6-3.1% revision rates) while Claude and Gemini were
far more flexible (28-41%). Value patterns also diverged: GPT emphasized
personal autonomy and direct communication, while Claude and Gemini prioritized
empathetic dialogue. Certain values proved especially effective at driving
verdict changes. We further find that deliberation format had a strong impact
on model behavior: GPT and Gemini stood out as highly conforming relative to
Claude, with their verdict behavior strongly shaped by order effects. These
results show how deliberation format and model-specific behaviors shape moral
reasoning in multi-turn interactions, underscoring that sociotechnical
alignment depends on how systems structure dialogue as much as on their
outputs.

### [10] [Improving AI Efficiency in Data Centres by Power Dynamic Response](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11119)
*Andrea Marinoni,Sai Shivareddy,Pietro Lio',Weisi Lin,Erik Cambria,Clare Grey*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores innovative strategies for managing the power consumption of AI data centers to enhance sustainability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of AI and the high power demands of data centers underscore the need for a sustainable and efficient power management approach to mitigate environmental impact.

Method: The study examines a dynamic input power strategy, comparing the performance of passive and active devices based on computational gain, energy efficiency, capital expenditure, and management costs using global data trends.

Result: The innovative power management approach demonstrates improved energy efficiency, reduced costs, and greater operational sustainability for AI data centers.

Conclusion: Adopting a dynamic power input strategy represents a paradigm shift, offering significant benefits for AI data center sustainability across environmental, financial, and societal dimensions.

Abstract: The steady growth of artificial intelligence (AI) has accelerated in the
recent years, facilitated by the development of sophisticated models such as
large language models and foundation models. Ensuring robust and reliable power
infrastructures is fundamental to take advantage of the full potential of AI.
However, AI data centres are extremely hungry for power, putting the problem of
their power management in the spotlight, especially with respect to their
impact on environment and sustainable development. In this work, we investigate
the capacity and limits of solutions based on an innovative approach for the
power management of AI data centres, i.e., making part of the input power as
dynamic as the power used for data-computing functions. The performance of
passive and active devices are quantified and compared in terms of
computational gain, energy efficiency, reduction of capital expenditure, and
management costs by analysing power trends from multiple data platforms
worldwide. This strategy, which identifies a paradigm shift in the AI data
centre power management, has the potential to strongly improve the
sustainability of AI hyperscalers, enhancing their footprint on environmental,
financial, and societal fields.

### [11] [RIPRAG: Hack a Black-box Retrieval-Augmented Generation Question-Answering System with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10008)
*Meng Xi,Sihan Lv,Yechen Jin,Guanjie Cheng,Naibo Wang,Ying Li,Jianwei Yin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces RIPRAG, a black-box attacking framework for RAG systems using Reinforcement Learning, achieving high success rates in poisoning attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind the paper is to explore the security vulnerabilities of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems when an attacker lacks knowledge about the system's architecture and functionality (black-box scenario), addressing a more realistic and complex setup than previous white-box approaches.

Method: The paper proposes RIPRAG, an end-to-end attack framework that uses Reinforcement Learning to optimize the poisoned document generation process to align with the target RAG system's preferences, even in black-box conditions.

Result: Experimental results show that RIPRAG successfully executes poisoning attacks on complex RAG systems, with an ASR improvement of up to 0.72 over baseline methods.

Conclusion: The study highlights significant security deficiencies in current RAG systems, emphasizing the need for more robust defensive methods to safeguard LLM-based architectures.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems based on Large Language Models
(LLMs) have become a core technology for tasks such as question-answering (QA)
and content generation. However, by injecting poisoned documents into the
database of RAG systems, attackers can manipulate LLMs to generate text that
aligns with their intended preferences. Existing research has primarily focused
on white-box attacks against simplified RAG architectures. In this paper, we
investigate a more complex and realistic scenario: the attacker lacks knowledge
of the RAG system's internal composition and implementation details, and the
RAG system comprises components beyond a mere retriever. Specifically, we
propose the RIPRAG attack framework, an end-to-end attack pipeline that treats
the target RAG system as a black box, where the only information accessible to
the attacker is whether the poisoning succeeds. Our method leverages
Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize the generation model for poisoned
documents, ensuring that the generated poisoned document aligns with the target
RAG system's preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that this method can
effectively execute poisoning attacks against most complex RAG systems,
achieving an attack success rate (ASR) improvement of up to 0.72 compared to
baseline methods. This highlights prevalent deficiencies in current defensive
methods and provides critical insights for LLM security research.

### [12] [Failure-Driven Workflow Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10035)
*Jusheng Zhang,Kaitong Cai,Qinglin Zeng,Ningyuan Liu,Stephen Fan,Ziliang Chen,Keze Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces CE-Graph, a novel approach that focuses on minimizing failure probability distributions in large language model (LLM) workflows, achieving greater robustness at reduced cost compared to other methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current optimization of LLM workflows focuses on global search with scalar metrics, which leads to information loss and the inability to model failures effectively.

Method: Proposes minimizing Expected Failure Mass by considering failure probability distributions in a multi-dimensional space; operationalizes this using CE-Graph, which identifies and targets failure modes through counterexample analysis and graph edits.

Result: CE-Graph enhances robustness in math, code, and QA tasks while being more cost-effective than baseline approaches.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that robustness comes not from avoiding failures but from understanding and systematically reshaping failure distributions.

Abstract: Optimizing LLM-based workflows is typically formulated as a global search,
where candidate workflows are evaluated based on a scalar metric. This
paradigm, however, suffers from a critical flaw: information collapse. By
reducing rich, multi-step execution traces to simple success/failure signals,
existing methods are rendered blind to the underlying structure of failures,
fundamentally preventing them from modeling the workflow's failure
distribution. We reconceptualize this challenge as a distributional problem. We
propose a new paradigm where the optimization goal is not to maximize a scalar
score, but to directly minimize a workflow's Expected Failure Mass, i.e., the
integral of its failure probability density function defined over a
high-dimensional Failure Signature Space (FSS). This distributional lens allows
us to move from inefficient, zero-order optimization to a principled,
gradient-like descent on the failure landscape itself. We introduce CE-Graph, a
framework that operationalizes this paradigm through a novel, failure-driven
refinement process. CE-Graph approximates the failure distribution from a pool
of counterexamples, identifies its densest regions as recurring failure modes,
and applies targeted, operator-constrained graph edits via a Propose-and-Verify
mechanism to greedily reduce the failure mass. On math, code, and QA
benchmarks, our CE-Graph achieves higher robustness at a significantly lower
cost than strong baselines. This suggests that a system's reliability emerges
not from avoiding failures, but from systematically learning and reshaping the
geometric structure of its failure distributions.

### [13] [Belief Graphs with Reasoning Zones: Structure, Dynamics, and Epistemic Activation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10042)
*Saleh Nikooroo,Thomas Engel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a graph-theoretic framework for reasoning despite contradictions, utilizing concepts like credibility, confidence, and propagation processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a framework capable of effective reasoning despite globally inconsistent belief systems, ensuring stability and localized inference despite contradictions.

Method: The paper models beliefs as nodes in a directed, signed, weighted graph and introduces a contractive propagation process for calculating confidence. It defines reasoning zones and uses a near-linear algorithm for their identification and repair.

Result: The framework recovers reasoning zones in synthetic graphs, shows stability under shock updates, and achieves efficient runtime in experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables stable, localized, contradiction-tolerant reasoning and provides a structured foundation for using classical logic in supportive substructures.

Abstract: Belief systems are rarely globally consistent, yet effective reasoning often
persists locally. We propose a novel graph-theoretic framework that cleanly
separates credibility--external, a priori trust in sources--from confidence--an
internal, emergent valuation induced by network structure. Beliefs are nodes in
a directed, signed, weighted graph whose edges encode support and
contradiction. Confidence is obtained by a contractive propagation process that
mixes a stated prior with structure-aware influence and guarantees a unique,
stable solution. Within this dynamics, we define reasoning zones:
high-confidence, structurally balanced subgraphs on which classical inference
is safe despite global contradictions. We provide a near-linear procedure that
seeds zones by confidence, tests balance using a parity-based coloring, and
applies a greedy, locality-preserving repair with Jaccard de-duplication to
build a compact atlas. To model belief change, we introduce shock updates that
locally downscale support and elevate targeted contradictions while preserving
contractivity via a simple backtracking rule. Re-propagation yields localized
reconfiguration-zones may shrink, split, or collapse--without destabilizing the
entire graph. We outline an empirical protocol on synthetic signed graphs with
planted zones, reporting zone recovery, stability under shocks, and runtime.
The result is a principled foundation for contradiction-tolerant reasoning that
activates classical logic precisely where structure supports it.

*Ruohao Li,Hongjun Liu,Leyi Zhao,Zisu Li,Jiawei Li,Jiajun Jiang,Linning Xu,Chen Zhao,Mingming Fan,Chen Liang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SwarmSys is a new distributed multi-agent reasoning framework inspired by swarm intelligence, which demonstrates improved performance in various reasoning tasks compared to existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of fixed roles and centralized control in existing multi-agent frameworks for long-horizon reasoning.

Method: SwarmSys uses a closed-loop framework with three iterative roles (Explorers, Workers, Validators) and incorporates adaptive profiles, probabilistic matching, and pheromone-inspired reinforcement for dynamic and self-organizing task allocation.

Result: SwarmSys outperforms baseline models in symbolic reasoning, research synthesis, and scientific programming tasks, improving both accuracy and stability of reasoning.

Conclusion: Swarm-inspired coordination offers a scalable, robust, and adaptive approach to multi-agent reasoning and may be as impactful as model scaling in enhancing LLM intelligence.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have shown remarkable reasoning abilities.
However, existing multi-agent frameworks often rely on fixed roles or
centralized control, limiting scalability and adaptability in long-horizon
reasoning. We introduce SwarmSys, a closed-loop framework for distributed
multi-agent reasoning inspired by swarm intelligence. Coordination in SwarmSys
emerges through iterative interactions among three specialized roles,
Explorers, Workers, and Validators, that continuously cycle through
exploration, exploitation, and validation. To enable scalable and adaptive
collaboration, we integrate adaptive agent and event profiles, embedding-based
probabilistic matching, and a pheromone-inspired reinforcement mechanism,
supporting dynamic task allocation and self-organizing convergence without
global supervision. Across symbolic reasoning, research synthesis, and
scientific programming tasks, SwarmSys consistently outperforms baselines,
improving both accuracy and reasoning stability. These findings highlight
swarm-inspired coordination as a promising paradigm for scalable, robust, and
adaptive multi-agent reasoning, suggesting that coordination scaling may rival
model scaling in advancing LLM intelligence.

*Zeyu Ling,Xiaodong Gu,Jiangnan Tang,Changqing Zou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SyncLipMAE is a self-supervised learning framework for talking-face videos that achieves state-of-the-art performance in multiple audio-visual tasks by learning synchronization-aware facial dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of learning transferable and synchronization-aware facial dynamics from unlabeled audio-visual data for various downstream tasks.

Method: The approach combines masked visual modeling with cross-modal contrastive alignment, using three per-frame prompt tokens encoding identity, vocal motion, and ambient motion. A contrastive objective aligns audio and visual tokens in a shared embedding space through positives (synchronized pairs) and negatives (misaligned pairs).

Result: SyncLipMAE demonstrates strong performance across four task families: audio-visual synchronization, facial emotion/action recognition, visual speech recognition, and visual dubbing.

Conclusion: The proposed synchronization-aware pretraining approach enables a unified model to excel in diverse downstream tasks, showcasing the value of factorized self-supervised learning for talking-face video analysis.

Abstract: We introduce SyncLipMAE, a self-supervised pretraining framework for
talking-face video that learns synchronization-aware and transferable facial
dynamics from unlabeled audio-visual streams. Our approach couples masked
visual modeling with cross-modal contrastive alignment and employs three
per-frame prompt tokens that explicitly encode the essential factors of a
talking-face frame - identity, vocal motion (speech-synchronized facial
dynamics), and ambient motion (audio-agnostic movements such as blinks and head
pose). The contrastive objective uses time-aligned vocal-motion and audio
tokens as positives and misaligned pairs as negatives, driving both modalities
into a shared embedding space and yielding token-level audio-visual stream
synchronization. After pretraining, the aligned audio tokens together with the
visual prompt tokens (identity, vocal motion, ambient motion) form a unified
interface for four disparate downstream settings: (i) audio-visual stream
synchronization; (ii) facial emotion and head/face action recognition; (iii)
visual speech recognition; and (iv) visual dubbing, for which we enable
indistinguishable audio- or video-driven control within a single model. Across
four task families that require distinct capabilities, SyncLipMAE achieves
state-of-the-art results, underscoring the effectiveness of
synchronization-aware, factorized self-supervised pretraining.

*Jiayi Mao,Liqun Li,Yanjie Gao,Zegang Peng,Shilin He,Chaoyun Zhang,Si Qin,Samia Khalid,Qingwei Lin,Saravan Rajmohan,Sitaram Lanka,Dongmei Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: StepFly is a new framework aimed at automating troubleshooting guides in IT systems, enhancing execution accuracy and reducing processing time compared to existing solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Incident management in IT systems is hindered by slow and error-prone manual execution of troubleshooting guides. Leveraging LLMs offers a potential solution, but current methods lack support for complex challenges.

Method: StepFly introduces a three-stage process: improving TSG quality via TSG Mentor, preprocessing with LLMs to extract structured DAGs and dedicated plugins, and executing workflows with a DAG-guided system that supports parallel processing.

Result: StepFly achieved a ~94% success rate using GPT-4.1, improved execution speed for parallelizable TSGs by up to 70.4%, and consumed fewer resources compared to baseline approaches.

Conclusion: StepFly effectively enhances the automation, efficiency, and accuracy of incident management in IT systems by addressing critical challenges in troubleshooting guides.

Abstract: Effective incident management in large-scale IT systems relies on
troubleshooting guides (TSGs), but their manual execution is slow and
error-prone. While recent advances in LLMs offer promise for automating
incident management tasks, existing LLM-based solutions lack specialized
support for several key challenges, including managing TSG quality issues,
interpreting complex control flow, handling data-intensive queries, and
exploiting execution parallelism. We first conducted an empirical study on 92
real-world TSGs, and, guided by our findings, we present StepFly, a novel
end-to-end agentic framework for troubleshooting guide automation. Our approach
features a three-stage workflow: the first stage provides a comprehensive guide
together with a tool, TSG Mentor, to assist SREs in improving TSG quality; the
second stage performs offline preprocessing using LLMs to extract structured
execution DAGs from unstructured TSGs and to create dedicated Query Preparation
Plugins (QPPs); and the third stage executes online using a DAG-guided
scheduler-executor framework with a memory system to guarantee correct workflow
and support parallel execution of independent steps. Our empirical evaluation
on a collection of real-world TSGs and incidents demonstrates that StepFly
achieves a ~94% success rate on GPT-4.1, outperforming baselines with less time
and token consumption. Furthermore, it achieves a remarkable execution time
reduction of 32.9% to 70.4% for parallelizable TSGs.

*Yunxiang Mo,Tianshi Zheng,Qing Zong,Jiayu Liu,Baixuan Xu,Yauwai Yim,Chunkit Chan,Jiaxin Bai,Yangqiu Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces DixitWorld to assess multimodal abductive reasoning in vision-language models using dynamic and static tasks, revealing differences in creativity and discriminative abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in evaluating multimodal abductive reasoning in vision-language models, especially in dynamic, multi-agent settings.

Method: Developed DixitWorld comprising DixitArena (dynamic, multi-agent reasoning tasks) and DixitBench (static QA benchmark) for controlled evaluations.

Result: Smaller models excel in creative storytelling but lack discriminative clues, while larger models perform better overall, especially in hypothesis selection tasks.

Conclusion: The study highlights a trade-off between creative generation and discriminative understanding, emphasizing challenges in creating balanced vision-language models.

Abstract: Multimodal abductive reasoning--the generation and selection of explanatory
hypotheses from partial observations--is a cornerstone of intelligence. Current
evaluations of this ability in vision-language models (VLMs) are largely
confined to static, single-agent tasks. Inspired by Dixit, we introduce
DixitWorld, a comprehensive evaluation suite designed to deconstruct this
challenge. DIXITWORLD features two core components: DixitArena, a dynamic,
multi-agent environment that evaluates both hypothesis generation (a
"storyteller" crafting cryptic clues) and hypothesis selection ("listeners"
choosing the target image from decoys) under imperfect information; and
DixitBench, a static QA benchmark that isolates the listener's task for
efficient, controlled evaluation. Results from DixitArena reveal distinct,
role-dependent behaviors: smaller open-source models often excel as creative
storytellers, producing imaginative yet less discriminative clues, whereas
larger proprietary models demonstrate superior overall performance,
particularly as listeners. Performance on DixitBench strongly correlates with
listener results in DixitArena, validating it as a reliable proxy for
hypothesis selection. Our findings reveal a key trade-off between generative
creativity and discriminative understanding in multimodal abductive reasoning,
a central challenge for developing more balanced and capable vision-language
agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the problem of inconsistent character identity in diffusion-based text-to-image generation across varying prompts.

Method: Utilizing modular and composable LoRA adapters with a frozen diffusion backbone that dynamically composes adapters during inference, controlled by prompt-aware mechanisms.

Result: CharCom enhances character fidelity, semantic alignment, and temporal coherence in multi-scene narratives, performs robustly in crowded scenes, and supports scalable multi-character generation.

Conclusion: CharCom proves effective for applications like story illustration and animation while maintaining minimal operational overhead, showcasing its potential in real-world implementations.

Abstract: Ensuring character identity consistency across varying prompts remains a
fundamental limitation in diffusion-based text-to-image generation. We propose
CharCom, a modular and parameter-efficient framework that achieves
character-consistent story illustration through composable LoRA adapters,
enabling efficient per-character customization without retraining the base
model. Built on a frozen diffusion backbone, CharCom dynamically composes
adapters at inference using prompt-aware control. Experiments on multi-scene
narratives demonstrate that CharCom significantly enhances character fidelity,
semantic alignment, and temporal coherence. It remains robust in crowded scenes
and enables scalable multi-character generation with minimal overhead, making
it well-suited for real-world applications such as story illustration and
animation.

*Chengqian Gao,Haonan Li,Taylor W. Killian,Jianshu She,Renxi Wang,Liqun Ma,Zhoujun Cheng,Shibo Hao,Zhiqiang Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method called PALU (Performance-Aware Length Updating) to improve the conciseness and accuracy of reasoning in large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in concise reasoning methods, which often struggle to balance brevity and accuracy, and fail to generalize across domains and model sizes.

Method: PALU formulates concise reasoning as a constrained optimization problem, leveraging Lagrangian optimization and simplifying it through approximations like off-policy rollouts and quantile-driven adjustments.

Result: PALU reduced output length by 65%, improved accuracy by 15%, and demonstrated adaptability across domains and model scales (1.5B to 14B parameters).

Conclusion: PALU is a practical, effective strategy for concise reasoning, outperforming existing methods in both brevity and performance across diverse domains and model sizes.

Abstract: Concise reasoning in large language models seeks to generate only essential
intermediate steps needed to arrive at a final answer, thereby alleviating
issues of overthinking. Most proposed approaches hinge on carefully
hand-crafted heuristics, struggling to balance concision with performance,
often failing to adapt across domains and model scales. In this work, we
address these challenges by introducing a principled and pragmatic strategy,
performance-aware length updating (PALU). As a principled algorithm, PALU
formulates concise reasoning as a constrained optimization problem, minimizing
response length subject to a performance constraint, and then applies
Lagrangian optimization to convert it into a tractable unconstrained problem.
As a pragmatic solution, PALU streamlines complicated update rules through
three approximations: (i) estimating performance with off-policy rollouts, (ii)
truncating the Lagrange multiplier to two extremes, and (iii) replacing
gradient-based updates with quantile-driven length adjustments. PALU reduces
output length by 65% while improving accuracy by 15% when applied to
DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, averaged over five benchmarks, outperforming a
range of alternative methods. Furthermore, PALU is demonstrated to adapt across
both domain (logic, STEM and math) and model scale (1.5B, 7B, 14B) entrenching
the algorithm as a practical and effective concise reasoning approach.

### [20] [SAFER: Risk-Constrained Sample-then-Filter in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10193)
*Qingni Wang,Yue Fan,Xin Eric Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces SAFER, a framework improving the reliability of large language models in open-ended QA scenarios by ensuring calibrated sampling and filtering methods that offer statistical guarantees on correct answer inclusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the unrealistic assumptions of existing selective conformal prediction methods in scenarios lacking a fixed solution space, ensuring the trustworthiness of outputs from large language models in risk-sensitive applications.

Method: SAFER involves two stages: calibrating a sampling budget using the Clopper-Pearson exact method and employing a conformal risk control method to filter unreliable answers under calibrated risk levels.

Result: SAFER provides statistical guarantees while controlling risk levels, showing compatibility with various task-specific criteria and calibration-test splits to improve robustness and data efficiency.

Conclusion: The framework improves statistical validity and trustworthiness in large language model outputs, particularly in open-ended question answering scenarios lacking finite solution spaces.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in risk-sensitive
applications such as real-world open-ended question answering (QA), ensuring
the trustworthiness of their outputs has become critical. Existing selective
conformal prediction (SCP) methods provide statistical guarantees by
constructing prediction sets with a constrained miscoverage rate for correct
answers. However, prior works unrealistically assume that admissible answers
for all instances can be obtained via finite sampling, even for open-ended QA
scenarios that lack a fixed and finite solution space. To address this, we
introduce a two-stage risk control framework comprising abstention-aware
sampling and conformalized filtering (SAFER). Firstly, on a held-out
calibration set, SAFER calibrates a sampling budget within the maximum sampling
cap, using the Clopper-Pearson exact method at a user-desired risk level (i.e.,
the maximum allowable miscoverage rate of the sampling sets). If the risk level
cannot be satisfied within the cap, we abstain; otherwise, the calibrated
sampling budget becomes the minimum requirements at test time. Then, we employ
calibration instances where correct answers are attainable under the calibrated
budget and apply the conformal risk control method to determine a statistically
valid uncertainty threshold, which filters unreliable distractors from the
candidate set for each test data point. In this stage, SAFER introduces an
additional risk level to guide the calculation of the threshold, thereby
controlling the risk of correct answers being excluded. Furthermore, we show
that SAFER is compatible with various task-specific admission criteria and
calibration-test split ratios, highlighting its robustness and high data
efficiency.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Large Language Models (LLMs) face challenges like data scarcity and overfitting. This paper proposes Environment Tuning, a new paradigm to improve training stability with structured curriculums, corrective feedback, and rewards, achieving notable performance even with limited problem instances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in training LLM agents, such as the scarcity of high-quality training data, overfitting from synthetic data, and instability in traditional reinforcement learning methods.

Method: A novel training paradigm termed Environment Tuning is introduced, involving dynamic environment-based exploration, corrective feedback, structured curriculums, environment augmentation, and progress-based rewards.

Result: When trained on just 400 problem instances from the BFCL benchmark, Environment Tuning achieves competitive in-distribution performance and superior out-of-distribution generalization compared to SFT-based methods.

Conclusion: Environment Tuning presents a shift in training techniques to improve robustness and data efficiency, outperforming traditional methods and mitigating limitations like performance collapse.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents show great promise for complex, multi-turn
tool-use tasks, but their development is often hampered by the extreme scarcity
of high-quality training data. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on synthetic data
leads to overfitting, whereas standard reinforcement learning (RL) struggles
with a critical cold-start problem and training instability. To address these
challenges, we introduce $\textbf{Environment Tuning}$, a novel training
paradigm that enables agents to learn complex behaviors directly from problem
instances without relying on pre-collected expert trajectories.
$\textbf{Environment Tuning}$ orchestrates this learning process through a
structured curriculum, actionable environment augmentation that provides
corrective feedback, and fine-grained progress rewards to ensure stable and
efficient exploration. Using only 400 problem instances from Berkeley
Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCL) benchmark, our method not only achieves
competitive in-distribution performance against strong baselines but also
demonstrates superior out-of-distribution generalization, overcoming the
performance collapse common to SFT-based approaches. Our work presents a
paradigm shift from supervised fine-tuning on static trajectories to dynamic,
environment-based exploration, paving the way for training more robust and
data-efficient agents.

*Manjiang Yu,Hongji Li,Priyanka Singh,Xue Li,Di Wang,Lijie Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces PIXEL, a novel method for activation steering in LLMs to reliably control attributes like truthfulness and alignments without extensive fine-tuning, ensuring trustworthy generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the lack of principled methods in existing activation steering approaches for aligning attributes in large language models, which are critical for deploying reliable LLMs on the web.

Method: PIXEL uses position-wise activation steering by learning property-aligned subspaces, selecting intervention strength via a constrained geometric objective with closed-form solutions, and employing lightweight scanning routines. It also includes sample-level residual calibration techniques.

Result: PIXEL shows consistent improvements in aligning attributes across diverse language models and evaluation paradigms while maintaining the general capabilities of the models.

Conclusion: PIXEL offers a principled and practical solution for controllable generation in LLMs, enhancing reliability and alignment without disrupting overall model functionality.

Abstract: Reliable behavior control is central to deploying large language models
(LLMs) on the web. Activation steering offers a tuning-free route to align
attributes (e.g., truthfulness) that ensure trustworthy generation. Prevailing
approaches rely on coarse heuristics and lack a principled account of where to
steer and how strongly to intervene. To this end, we propose Position-wise
Injection with eXact Estimated Levels (PIXEL), a position-wise activation
steering framework that, in contrast to prior work, learns a property-aligned
subspace from dual views (tail-averaged and end-token) and selects intervention
strength via a constrained geometric objective with a closed-form solution,
thereby adapting to token-level sensitivity without global hyperparameter
tuning. PIXEL further performs sample-level orthogonal residual calibration to
refine the global attribute direction and employs a lightweight
position-scanning routine to identify receptive injection sites. We
additionally provide representation-level guarantees for the
minimal-intervention rule, supporting reliable alignment. Across diverse models
and evaluation paradigms, PIXEL consistently improves attribute alignment while
preserving model general capabilities, offering a practical and principled
method for LLMs' controllable generation. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Adaptive Dual Reasoner (ADR), a model alternating between fast and slow thinking for better reasoning efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to reduce computational costs and inference latency in Long Reasoning Models (LRMs) caused by overthinking.

Method: Two-stage training: supervised fine-tuning using a hybrid reasoning dataset and reinforcement learning with Entropy-guided Hybrid Policy Optimization (EHPO).

Result: ADR improves reasoning performance by up to 6.1% and reduces reasoning output length by 49.5% to 59.3% across math reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: ADR effectively balances reasoning performance and efficiency among state-of-the-art approaches by dynamically using fast and slow thinking modes.

Abstract: Although Long Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved superior performance on
various reasoning scenarios, they often suffer from increased computational
costs and inference latency caused by overthinking. To address these
limitations, we propose Adaptive Dual Reasoner, which supports two reasoning
modes: fast thinking and slow thinking. ADR dynamically alternates between
these modes based on the contextual complexity during reasoning. ADR is trained
in two stages: (1) A cold-start stage using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to
equip the model with the ability to integrate both fast and slow reasoning
modes, in which we construct a hybrid reasoning dataset through a dedicated
pipeline to provide large-scale supervision. (2) A reinforcement learning stage
for optimizing reasoning effort, where we introduce Entropy-guided Hybrid
Policy Optimization EHPO, an RL training framework employing an entropy-guided
dynamic rollout strategy for branching at high-entropy units and a
difficulty-aware penalty to balance fast and slow reasoning. Across challenging
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, ADR achieves an effective balance between
reasoning performance and efficiency among state-of-the-art approaches.
Specifically, ADR yields a performance gain of up to 6.1%, while reducing the
reasoning output length by 49.5% to 59.3%.

TL;DR: This paper identifies ultra-sparse critical neurons in LLMs that are essential for maintaining their performance, even in large models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether Large Language Models (LLMs) contain a small subset of critical neurons, similar to the human brain, which are essential for core cognitive functions.

Method: The authors propose a Perturbation-based Causal Identification of Critical Neurons method to systematically locate critical neurons in LLMs.

Result: (1) LLMs have ultra-sparse critical neuron sets that, when disrupted, can cause severe performance collapse. (2) These neurons are concentrated in specific model layers (outer layers, MLP down_proj components). (3) Disruption of critical neurons leads to sharp phase transitions in performance degradation.

Conclusion: Critical neurons play a pivotal role in LLM functionality. Recognizing their distribution and behavior can inform the design of robust architectures and improve LLM security in safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational tools in natural
language processing, powering a wide range of applications and research. Many
studies have shown that LLMs share significant similarities with the human
brain. Recent neuroscience research has found that a small subset of biological
neurons in the human brain are crucial for core cognitive functions, which
raises a fundamental question: do LLMs also contain a small subset of critical
neurons? In this paper, we investigate this question by proposing a
Perturbation-based Causal Identification of Critical Neurons method to
systematically locate such critical neurons in LLMs. Our findings reveal three
key insights: (1) LLMs contain ultra-sparse critical neuron sets. Disrupting
these critical neurons can cause a 72B-parameter model with over 1.1 billion
neurons to completely collapse, with perplexity increasing by up to 20 orders
of magnitude; (2) These critical neurons are not uniformly distributed, but
tend to concentrate in the outer layers, particularly within the MLP down\_proj
components; (3) Performance degradation exhibits sharp phase transitions,
rather than a gradual decline, when these critical neurons are disrupted.
Through comprehensive experiments across diverse model architectures and
scales, we provide deeper analysis of these phenomena and their implications
for LLM robustness and interpretability. These findings can offer guidance for
developing more robust model architectures and improving deployment security in
safety-critical applications.

TL;DR: The study addresses hallucination in multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs) by proposing a lightweight, interpretable plugin that improves model reliability and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucination in MLRMs leads to errors in reasoning chains and visual interpretation, posing challenges for their safe deployment.

Method: The researchers introduce Functional Head Identification and Class-conditioned Rescaling, a plugin that identifies attention heads' contributions and regulates them without retraining.

Result: The plugin yields a 5%-15% improvement across benchmarks, utilizing minimal additional computation (<1%) and latency (9%).

Conclusion: The proposed plugin enhances the reliability and interpretability of MLRMs, making them safer for high-stakes applications.

Abstract: Multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs) are rapidly advancing
vision-language reasoning and are emerging as a foundation for cross-modal
intelligence. Hallucination remains a persistent failure mode, manifesting
itself as erroneous reasoning chains and misinterpretation of visual content.
In this study, we observe that attention heads exhibit a staged division:
shallow heads predominantly serve perception, while deeper heads shift toward
symbolic reasoning, revealing two major causes of hallucination, namely
perceptual bias and reasoning drift. To address these issues, we propose a
lightweight and interpretable two-step plugin, Functional Head Identification
and Class-conditioned Rescaling, which locates perception- and
reasoning-oriented heads and regulates their contributions without retraining.
Evaluations on three real-world MLRMs (Kimi-VL, Ocean-R1, R1-Onevision), six
benchmarks across three domains, and four baselines show that our plugin
achieves an average improvement of 5% and up to 15%, with only <1% additional
computation and 9% of baseline latency. Our approach is completely
model-agnostic and significantly enhances both the reliability and
interpretability of the off-the-shelf MLRMs, thereby enabling their safe
deployment in high-stakes applications. Our code is available at

technique, the Intent, Context, and Action (ICA) format, which transforms
policies and workflows into a structure more comprehensible to LLMs.
Additionally, we develop a synthetic data generation strategy to create
training data with minimal human intervention, enabling cost-effective
fine-tuning of our model. Our internal experiments (not applied to Airbnb
products) demonstrate that our approach of restructuring workflows and
fine-tuning LLMs with synthetic data significantly enhances their performance,
setting a new benchmark for their application in customer support. Our solution
is not only cost-effective but also improves customer support, as evidenced by
both accuracy and manual processing time evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the concept of "inclusive innovation dividend," suggesting that healthcare AI solutions designed for diverse use cases lead to broader market advantages. Four mechanisms are outlined for driving economic returns, paired with a practical framework to evaluate AI investments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring the economic and strategic value of inclusive design in healthcare AI, primarily as a business advantage beyond ethical compliance.

Method: The authors propose a scoring system, the Healthcare AI Inclusive Innovation Framework (HAIIF), to evaluate the strategic benefits of inclusivity in healthcare AI.

Result: The paper identifies four mechanisms of economic benefits from inclusive innovation, including improved market scalability, risk mitigation, better system performance, and competitive talent acquisition.

Conclusion: Investing in inclusive design offers sustained competitive advantages and market expansion, making inclusivity a strategic business differentiation instead of mere regulatory compliance.

Abstract: While ethical arguments for fairness in healthcare AI are well-established,
the economic and strategic value of inclusive design remains underexplored.
This perspective introduces the ``inclusive innovation dividend'' -- the
counterintuitive principle that solutions engineered for diverse, constrained
use cases generate superior economic returns in broader markets. Drawing from
assistive technologies that evolved into billion-dollar mainstream industries,
we demonstrate how inclusive healthcare AI development creates business value
beyond compliance requirements. We identify four mechanisms through which
inclusive innovation drives returns: (1) market expansion via geographic
scalability and trust acceleration; (2) risk mitigation through reduced
remediation costs and litigation exposure; (3) performance dividends from
superior generalization and reduced technical debt, and (4) competitive
advantages in talent acquisition and clinical adoption. We present the
Healthcare AI Inclusive Innovation Framework (HAIIF), a practical scoring
system that enables organizations to evaluate AI investments based on their
potential to capture these benefits. HAIIF provides structured guidance for
resource allocation, transforming fairness and inclusivity from regulatory
checkboxes into sources of strategic differentiation. Our findings suggest that
organizations investing incrementally in inclusive design can achieve expanded

### [28] [Trace Length is a Simple Uncertainty Signal in Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10409)
*Siddartha Devic,Charlotte Peale,Arwen Bradley,Sinead Williamson,Preetum Nakkiran,Aravind Gollakota*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores using reasoning trace length as a confidence estimator for large reasoning models, revealing its potential based on experimental analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve uncertainty quantification in large language models to address issues like hallucination and increase reliability for deployment.

Method: The authors examined reasoning trace length as a confidence signal, conducted exhaustive experiments with models, datasets, and prompts, and investigated mechanisms like problem difficulty and token entropy impacting its performance.

Result: Reasoning post-training significantly changed the relationship between trace length and accuracy, beyond prior assumptions. Trace length was identified as a complementary and practical confidence measure compared to verbalized confidence.

Conclusion: Reasoning post-training enhances uncertainty quantification, and trace length is a useful and practical confidence measure for reasoning models.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification for LLMs is a key research direction towards
addressing hallucination and other issues that limit their reliable deployment.
In this work, we show that reasoning trace length is a simple and useful
confidence estimator in large reasoning models. Through comprehensive
experiments across multiple models, datasets, and prompts, we show that trace
length performs in comparable but complementary ways to other zero-shot
confidence estimators such as verbalized confidence. Our work reveals that
reasoning post-training fundamentally alters the relationship between trace
length and accuracy, going beyond prior work that had shown that post-training
causes traces to grow longer in general (e.g., "overthinking"). We investigate
the mechanisms behind trace length's performance as a confidence signal,
observing that the effect remains even after adjusting for confounders such as
problem difficulty and GRPO-induced length bias. We identify high-entropy or
"forking" tokens as playing a key role in the mechanism. Our findings
demonstrate that reasoning post-training enhances uncertainty quantification
beyond verbal expressions, and establish trace length as a practical confidence
measure for large reasoning models.

*Sihang Zeng,Yujuan Fu,Sitong Zhou,Zixuan Yu,Lucas Jing Liu,Jun Wen,Matthew Thompson,Ruth Etzioni,Meliha Yetisgen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Traj-CoA, a multi-agent system designed for better handling of noisy and large-scale EHR data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard LLMs struggle with the noisy and extensive nature of EHR data in reasoning over patient trajectories.

Method: Traj-CoA leverages a multi-agent system, employing worker agents for sequential processing and a manager agent to synthesize summaries. It also uses a long-term memory module called EHRMem.

Result: In a zero-shot prediction task for one-year lung cancer risk using five-year EHR data, Traj-CoA outperforms models from four different categories.

Conclusion: Traj-CoA demonstrates clinically aligned temporal reasoning, making it a robust and generalizable solution for complex patient trajectory modeling.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer a generalizable approach for modeling
patient trajectories, but suffer from the long and noisy nature of electronic
health records (EHR) data in temporal reasoning. To address these challenges,
we introduce Traj-CoA, a multi-agent system involving chain-of-agents for
patient trajectory modeling. Traj-CoA employs a chain of worker agents to
process EHR data in manageable chunks sequentially, distilling critical events
into a shared long-term memory module, EHRMem, to reduce noise and preserve a
comprehensive timeline. A final manager agent synthesizes the worker agents'
summary and the extracted timeline in EHRMem to make predictions. In a
zero-shot one-year lung cancer risk prediction task based on five-year EHR
data, Traj-CoA outperforms baselines of four categories. Analysis reveals that
Traj-CoA exhibits clinically aligned temporal reasoning, establishing it as a
promisingly robust and generalizable approach for modeling complex patient
trajectories.

*Hongjie Zheng,Zesheng Shi,Ping Yi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces MedCoAct, a confidence-aware multi-agent framework for medical AI, designed to improve integrated diagnostic and treatment workflows by simulating clinical collaboration. It includes a new benchmark, DrugCareQA, for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical AI systems lack cross-validation and knowledge integration in diagnostic and medication decision-making, which reduces their effectiveness in real-world applications.

Method: The authors propose a collaborative multi-agent framework (MedCoAct) that integrates specialized doctor and pharmacist agents, combined with the new benchmark DrugCareQA to evaluate performance in diagnosis and treatment workflows.

Result: MedCoAct achieved a diagnostic accuracy of 67.58% and medication recommendation accuracy of 67.58%, outperforming single-agent frameworks by over 7%.

Conclusion: The collaborative approach of MedCoAct enhances diagnostic and treatment effectiveness, generalizing well across medical scenarios and enabling interpretable decision-making pathways.

Abstract: Autonomous agents utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in isolated medical tasks like diagnosis and image
analysis, but struggle with integrated clinical workflows that connect
diagnostic reasoning and medication decisions. We identify a core limitation:
existing medical AI systems process tasks in isolation without the
cross-validation and knowledge integration found in clinical teams, reducing
their effectiveness in real-world healthcare scenarios. To transform the
isolation paradigm into a collaborative approach, we propose MedCoAct, a
confidence-aware multi-agent framework that simulates clinical collaboration by
integrating specialized doctor and pharmacist agents, and present a benchmark,
DrugCareQA, to evaluate medical AI capabilities in integrated diagnosis and
treatment workflows. Our results demonstrate that MedCoAct achieves 67.58\%
diagnostic accuracy and 67.58\% medication recommendation accuracy,
outperforming single agent framework by 7.04\% and 7.08\% respectively. This
collaborative approach generalizes well across diverse medical domains, proving
especially effective for telemedicine consultations and routine clinical
scenarios, while providing interpretable decision-making pathways.

### [31] [Tracing the Traces: Latent Temporal Signals for Efficient and Accurate Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10494)
*Martina G. Vilas,Safoora Yousefi,Besmira Nushi,Eric Horvitz,Vidhisha Balachandran*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Latent-Trajectory signals to predict reasoning success in AI models, making computation more efficient and accurate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inference-time scaling in reasoning models is inefficient due to wasted computation on unproductive reasoning paths, creating a need to predict successful traces early.

Method: The authors measure latent representation changes during reasoning and analyze their predictive power for solution accuracy and efficient answer selection.

Result: Latent-Trajectory signals reduce token usage by up to 70% while improving test-time accuracy by 2.6% on average.

Conclusion: These signals enhance inference efficiency, allowing early allocation of compute to the most promising reasoning paths, and offer insights into reasoning processes in latent space.

Abstract: Reasoning models improve their problem-solving ability through inference-time
scaling, allocating more compute via longer token budgets. Identifying which
reasoning traces are likely to succeed remains a key opportunity: reliably
predicting productive paths can substantially reduce wasted computation and
improve overall efficiency. We introduce Latent-Trajectory signals that
characterize the temporal evolution of a model's internal representations
during the generation of intermediate reasoning tokens. By measuring the
overall change in latent representations between the start and end of
reasoning, the change accumulated across intermediate steps, and the extent to
which these changes advance toward the final state, we show that these signals
predict solution accuracy more reliably than both cross-layer metrics and
output-based confidence measures. When used to guide answer selection across
multiple sampled generations, Latent-Trajectory signals make test-time scaling
more effective and efficient than majority voting, reducing token usage by up
to 70% while preserving and even improving accuracy by 2.6% on average.
Moreover, these predictive signals often emerge early in the reasoning trace,
enabling early selection and allocation of compute to the most promising
candidates. Our findings contribute not only practical strategies for
inference-time efficiency, but also a deeper interpretability perspective on
how reasoning processes are represented and differentiated in latent space.

*Xinbang Dai,Huikang Hu,Yongrui Chen,Jiaqi Li,Rihui Jin,Yuyang Zhang,Xiaoguang Li,Lifeng Shang,Guilin Qi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ELAIPBench examines LLMs' comprehension of AI research papers, revealing the challenges these models face in understanding full-length academic studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate LLMs' ability to deeply comprehend and reason about full-length academic papers, addressing limitations in existing benchmarks.

Method: Developed ELAIPBench, a benchmark of 403 multiple-choice questions from 137 AI research papers, curated through adversarial annotation to assess comprehension across three difficulty levels.

Result: The top-performing LLM achieved an accuracy of 39.95%. Additional systems like thinking mode or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) harmed rather than improved performance.

Conclusion: LLMs lag significantly in comprehending academic papers, highlighting gaps in their reasoning and retrieval capabilities.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) excel at many domain-specific tasks, their
ability to deeply comprehend and reason about full-length academic papers
remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks often fall short of capturing such
depth, either due to surface-level question design or unreliable evaluation
metrics. To address this gap, we introduce ELAIPBench, a benchmark curated by
domain experts to evaluate LLMs' comprehension of artificial intelligence (AI)
research papers. Developed through an incentive-driven, adversarial annotation
process, ELAIPBench features 403 multiple-choice questions from 137 papers. It
spans three difficulty levels and emphasizes non-trivial reasoning rather than
shallow retrieval. Our experiments show that the best-performing LLM achieves
an accuracy of only 39.95%, far below human performance. Moreover, we observe
that frontier LLMs equipped with a thinking mode or a retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) system fail to improve final results-even harming accuracy due
to overthinking or noisy retrieval. These findings underscore the significant
gap between current LLM capabilities and genuine comprehension of academic
papers.

### [33] [A Layered Intuition -- Method Model with Scope Extension for LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10592)
*Hong Su*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper integrates existing ideas on enhancing LLM performance, proposing a layered model with scope extension and entropy-based metrics for addressing unseen questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving LLM reasoning capabilities to address indirect, unseen problems systematically.

Method: The paper introduces an Intuition-Method Layered Model with scope extension (vertical, horizontal, temporal, spatial) and proposes entropy as a metric for evaluating method effectiveness.

Result: The proposed model organizes reasoning into knowledge trees and networks, enhancing adaptability and problem-solving capacity.

Conclusion: It advances a systematic reasoning paradigm for LLMs capable of solving complex real-world problems with increased diversity and independence.

Abstract: Existing studies have introduced method-based reasoning and scope extension
as approaches to enhance Large Language Model (LLM) performance beyond direct
matrix mappings. Building on these foundations, this paper summarizes and
integrates these ideas into a unified Intuition-Method Layered Model with Scope
Extension, designed to address indirected (unseen) issues more systematically.
In this framework, intuition-based thinking provides rapid first-reaction
answers, while method-based thinking decouples questions and solutions into
transferable reasoning units. Scope extension is then applied to broaden
applicability, including vertical (cause analysis), horizontal (parallel and
generalized issues), and for the first time, temporal and spatial extensions,
which expand reasoning across time and contextual dimensions. These extensions
are organized into systematic knowledge trees that interconnect into a
knowledge network, thereby increasing adaptability. To quantitatively evaluate
this process, we propose the entropy of method extension, which measures the
independence and diversity of extensions as an indicator of the system's
capacity to solve unseen questions. By logically connecting existing approaches
with new extensions and introducing an entropy-based evaluation framework, this
work advances toward a more robust and extensible reasoning paradigm for LLMs
in real-world problem-solving.

*Ruolan Cheng,Yong Deng,Serafín Moral,José Ramón Trillo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel distance measure for Random Permutation Sets (RPSs) using the cumulative Jaccard index, offering better sensitivity and flexibility compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of accurately measuring distances between permutation mass functions within Random Permutation Set theory, improving on current limitations.

Method: The authors propose a new definition of the cumulative Jaccard index for quantifying similarity between permutations. This index is the basis for their RPS distance measure, with corrections for matrix properties and adjustable parameters to enhance sensitivity.

Result: The proposed distance measure is structurally sound and demonstrates a natural top-weightiness property. Experimental comparisons reveal its advantages, including overcoming limitations of existing methods and compatibility with Jousselme distance.

Conclusion: The paper offers a robust and adaptable method for measuring RPS distances, advancing Random Permutation Set theory research while addressing key shortcomings in prior methods.

Abstract: Random permutation set (RPS) is a recently proposed framework designed to
represent order-structured uncertain information. Measuring the distance
between permutation mass functions is a key research topic in RPS theory
(RPST). This paper conducts an in-depth analysis of distances between RPSs from
two different perspectives: random finite set (RFS) and transferable belief
model (TBM). Adopting the layer-2 belief structure interpretation of RPS, we
regard RPST as a refinement of TBM, where the order in the ordered focus set
represents qualitative propensity. Starting from the permutation, we introduce
a new definition of the cumulative Jaccard index to quantify the similarity
between two permutations and further propose a distance measure method for RPSs
based on the cumulative Jaccard index matrix. The metric and structural
properties of the proposed distance measure are investigated, including the
positive definiteness analysis of the cumulative Jaccard index matrix, and a
correction scheme is provided. The proposed method has a natural
top-weightiness property: inconsistencies between higher-ranked elements tend
to result in greater distance values. Two parameters are provided to the
decision-maker to adjust the weight and truncation depth. Several numerical
examples are used to compare the proposed method with the existing method. The
experimental results show that the proposed method not only overcomes the
shortcomings of the existing method and is compatible with the Jousselme
distance, but also has higher sensitivity and flexibility.

*WenTao Liu,Siyu Song,Hao Hao,Aimin Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new optimization method for training large language models using evolutionary algorithms, offering an alternative to traditional gradient-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address hardware limitations and the exclusion of non-differentiable architectures imposed by gradient-based optimizers like Adam in training large language models.

Method: The researchers employ evolutionary algorithms (EA4LLM) to optimize large language models, successfully applying this method to train a 1-billion-parameter model from the pre-trained stage.

Result: Extensive experiments showed that evolutionary algorithms could effectively optimize large neural networks, and key insights were provided on how this method works compared to traditional approaches.

Conclusion: This work challenges the dominance of gradient-based optimization methods for neural networks and opens a pathway for more computationally accessible and inclusive large language model research.

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress,
with model optimization primarily relying on gradient-based optimizers such as
Adam. However, these gradient-based methods impose stringent hardware
requirements, demanding high-concurrency, high-memory GPUs. Moreover, they
require all neural network operations to be differentiable, thereby excluding
many promising non-differentiable architectures from practical use. To address
these limitations, we propose a method for optimizing LLMs using evolutionary
algorithms (EA4LLM) and, for the first time, successfully demonstrate its
capability to train a 1-billion-parameter LLM from the pre-trained stage. We
conduct extensive experiments and provide key insights into how evolutionary
algorithms can effectively optimize neural networks. Our work challenges the
prevailing assumption that gradient-based optimization is the only viable
approach for training neural networks. It also holds significant potential to
reduce the computational cost of training large language models, thereby
enabling groups with limited computational resources to participate in deep
learning research.

*Jiabao Shi,Minfeng Qi,Lefeng Zhang,Di Wang,Yingjie Zhao,Ziying Li,Yalong Xing,Ningran Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework for improving text-to-image generation by coordinating multiple domain-specialized agents using reinforcement learning and multimodal integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of achieving semantic alignment and professional-level detail across diverse visual domains in multimodal text-to-image generation.

Method: They use a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a composite reward function, and techniques like contrastive learning, bidirectional attention, and iterative feedback.

Result: Experiments show significant improvements, such as a 1614% increase in word count and ROUGE-1 score reduction by 69.7%, with Transformer-based fusion methods providing the best performance.

Conclusion: Collaborative, specialization-driven architectures are promising for enhancing multimodal generative systems but still face consistency and semantic grounding challenges.

Abstract: Multimodal text-to-image generation remains constrained by the difficulty of
maintaining semantic alignment and professional-level detail across diverse
visual domains. We propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that
coordinates domain-specialized agents (e.g., focused on architecture,
portraiture, and landscape imagery) within two coupled subsystems: a text
enhancement module and an image generation module, each augmented with
multimodal integration components. Agents are trained using Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) under a composite reward function that balances semantic
similarity, linguistic visual quality, and content diversity. Cross-modal
alignment is enforced through contrastive learning, bidirectional attention,
and iterative feedback between text and image. Across six experimental
settings, our system significantly enriches generated content (word count
increased by 1614%) while reducing ROUGE-1 scores by 69.7%. Among fusion
methods, Transformer-based strategies achieve the highest composite score
(0.521), despite occasional stability issues. Multimodal ensembles yield
moderate consistency (ranging from 0.444 to 0.481), reflecting the persistent
challenges of cross-modal semantic grounding. These findings underscore the
promise of collaborative, specialization-driven architectures for advancing
reliable multimodal generative systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the application of interpretable machine learning techniques to better understand factors impacting student learning satisfaction, which has not been studied deeply with modern methods.

Method: Utilized APLR, a boosting-based model with interpretability, to analyze learning satisfaction data. Compared its efficacy against multiple state-of-the-art approaches and derived insights from its numerical and visual interpretations.

Result: Identified time management, concentration abilities, perceived helpfulness, and offline course participation as having a significant positive influence on learning satisfaction. Creative activities surprisingly had no positive effect.

Conclusion: APLR showed excellent predictive power for student satisfaction while providing interpretable insights at both group and individual levels, enabling personalized educational strategies.

Abstract: Although student learning satisfaction has been widely studied, modern
techniques such as interpretable machine learning and neural networks have not
been sufficiently explored. This study demonstrates that a recent model that
combines boosting with interpretability, automatic piecewise linear
regression(APLR), offers the best fit for predicting learning satisfaction
among several state-of-the-art approaches. Through the analysis of APLR's
numerical and visual interpretations, students' time management and
concentration abilities, perceived helpfulness to classmates, and participation
in offline courses have the most significant positive impact on learning
satisfaction. Surprisingly, involvement in creative activities did not
positively affect learning satisfaction. Moreover, the contributing factors can
be interpreted on an individual level, allowing educators to customize
instructions according to student profiles.

Conclusion: EA-GeoAI bridges geographical AI, long-term forecasting, and equity to assist policymakers in making equitable healthcare planning decisions.

Abstract: This paper presents EA-GeoAI, an integrated framework for demand forecasting

*Yi Zhang,Yushen Long,Yun Ni,Liping Huang,Xiaohong Wang,Jun Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a training-free hybrid framework integrating large language models with optimization to improve ride-hailing services, achieving 16% better performance compared to current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ride-hailing platforms often struggle with matching supply and demand dynamically while addressing spatial heterogeneity. Existing solutions either have data-efficiency and modeling limitations (RL approaches) or lack dynamic routing awareness (optimization methods), calling for an innovative approach.

Method: They propose a hierarchical integration of LLMs with mathematical optimization. LLMs act as meta-optimizers generating high-level objectives, which are refined through harmony search for better adaptability and performance in real-time.

Result: Experiments based on real-world datasets (New York and Chicago taxis) demonstrate a 16% average improvement over existing methods, showcasing its efficiency and adaptability.

Conclusion: The hybrid framework effectively combines LLMs and optimization into a dynamic hierarchical system, addressing the limitations of RL and traditional optimization for ride-hailing applications. This approach shows promise for real-world applications.

Abstract: Online ride-hailing platforms aim to deliver efficient mobility-on-demand
services, often facing challenges in balancing dynamic and spatially
heterogeneous supply and demand. Existing methods typically fall into two
categories: reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, which suffer from data
inefficiency, oversimplified modeling of real-world dynamics, and difficulty
enforcing operational constraints; or decomposed online optimization methods,
which rely on manually designed high-level objectives that lack awareness of
low-level routing dynamics. To address this issue, we propose a novel hybrid
framework that integrates large language model (LLM) with mathematical
optimization in a dynamic hierarchical system: (1) it is training-free,
removing the need for large-scale interaction data as in RL, and (2) it
leverages LLM to bridge cognitive limitations caused by problem decomposition
by adaptively generating high-level objectives. Within this framework, LLM
serves as a meta-optimizer, producing semantic heuristics that guide a
low-level optimizer responsible for constraint enforcement and real-time
decision execution. These heuristics are refined through a closed-loop
evolutionary process, driven by harmony search, which iteratively adapts the
LLM prompts based on feasibility and performance feedback from the optimization
layer. Extensive experiments based on scenarios derived from both the New York
and Chicago taxi datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,
achieving an average improvement of 16% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces UCAS, a method that refines advantage shaping in reinforcement learning for LLMs using uncertainty signals, leading to improved reasoning and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to solve inefficiencies in exploration and reasoning caused by uniform advantage signals and entropy collapse in algorithms like GRPO.

Method: UCAS refines credit assignment by using a dual mechanism: modulating response-level advantages via self-confidence and applying token-level penalties based on logit certainty.

Result: Experiments on five reasoning benchmarks showed UCAS consistently outperforms strong baselines in reward, reasoning diversity, and mitigates entropy collapse across different model scales.

Conclusion: UCAS effectively enhances exploration, reasoning diversity, and reward optimization for LLMs while addressing entropy collapse.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has shown significant
promise for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs). However, prevailing algorithms like GRPO broadcast a uniform advantage
signal across all tokens in a sequence. This coarse-grained approach overlooks
the pivotal role of uncertain, high-stakes decisions during reasoning, leading
to inefficient exploration and the well-documented problem of entropy collapse.
To address this, we introduce UnCertainty-aware Advantage Shaping (UCAS), a
model-free method that refines credit assignment by leveraging the model's
internal uncertainty signals. UCAS operates in two stages: it first modulates
the response-level advantage using the model's overall self-confidence, and
then applies a token-level penalty based on raw logit certainty. This dual
mechanism encourages exploration of high-uncertainty paths that yield correct
answers while penalizing overconfident yet erroneous reasoning, effectively
balancing the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Extensive experiments on five
mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that UCAS significantly outperforms
strong RLVR baselines across multiple model scales, including 1.5B and 7B. Our
analysis confirms that UCAS not only achieves higher rewards but also promotes
greater reasoning diversity and successfully mitigates entropy collapse.

development and orchestration of linear, deterministic agentic workflows
through a declarative, JSON-based configuration. Its modular architecture
decouples agent management, workflow execution, and post-processing, promoting

100 Large Language Models (LLMs) out-of-the-box. We present the architecture,
operational flow, and core features of simpliflow, demonstrating its utility
through diverse use cases ranging from software development simulation to
real-time system interaction. A comparative analysis with prominent frameworks
like LangChain and AutoGen highlights simpliflow's unique position as a tool
optimized for simplicity, control, and speed in deterministic workflow
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to comprehensively evaluate reasoning across audio and visual modalities, leading to the neglect or inconsistency in integrating these modalities.

Method: OmniVideoBench includes 1000 high-quality QA pairs annotated with reasoning traces across videos of varying durations, covering 13 question types like temporal reasoning, spatial localization, and causal inference.

Result: Multiple MLLMs evaluated on OmniVideoBench show a considerable performance gap compared to human reasoning, with open-source models performing worse than closed-source models.

Conclusion: The inherent difficulty of audio-visual reasoning highlights the need for benchmarks like OmniVideoBench to drive the development of MLLMs with stronger reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
substantial potential in video understanding. However, existing benchmarks fail
to comprehensively evaluate synergistic reasoning capabilities across audio and
visual modalities, often neglecting either one of the modalities or integrating
them in a logically inconsistent manner. To bridge this gap, we introduce
OmniVideoBench, a large-scale and rigorously designed benchmark dedicated to
assessing synergistic audio-visual understanding, with a strong emphasis on
modality complementarity and logical consistency. Specifically, OmniVideoBench
comprises 1000 high-quality question-answer(QA) pairs, each annotated with
step-by-step reasoning traces, derived from 628 diverse videos ranging from
several seconds to 30 minutes, and manually verified to guarantee complete
correctness and uniqueness. Moreover, OmniVideoBench encompasses 13 carefully
designed question types, covering temporal reasoning, spatial localization,
counting, causal inference, summarization, and beyond, thereby capturing the
essential challenges of video understanding. Evaluation of multiple MLLMs on
OmniVideoBench reveals a pronounced gap between model performance and human
reasoning, with open-source models lagging significantly behind their
closed-source counterparts, underscoring the inherent difficulty of genuine
audio-visual reasoning. We will release OmniVideoBench to foster the
development of MLLMs with stronger and more generalizable reasoning
capabilities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Extended Triangular Method (ETM), a novel algorithm designed to improve automated logical reasoning by enabling dynamic and flexible multi-clause interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of traditional binary resolution in automated deduction by enabling broader deductive synergy and computational efficiency.

Method: Formalizes and extends the Contradiction Separation Extension (CSE) framework using the Extended Triangular Method (ETM), which supports dynamic multi-clause reasoning within a geometric framework.

Result: ETM demonstrated effectiveness and generality in high-performance theorem provers tested on standard benchmarks like TPTP problem sets and CASC competitions.

Conclusion: The ETM advances automated deduction by providing a scalable and competitive model for logical inference, bridging theoretical and practical aspects, and paving the way for further research.

Abstract: Automated deduction lies at the core of Artificial Intelligence (AI),
underpinning theorem proving, formal verification, and logical reasoning.
Despite decades of progress, reconciling deductive completeness with
computational efficiency remains an enduring challenge. Traditional reasoning
calculi, grounded in binary resolution, restrict inference to pairwise clause
interactions and thereby limit deductive synergy among multiple clauses. The
Contradiction Separation Extension (CSE) framework, introduced in 2018,
proposed a dynamic multi-clause reasoning theory that redefined logical
inference as a process of contradiction separation rather than sequential
resolution. While that work established the theoretical foundation, its
algorithmic realization remained unformalized and unpublished. This work
presents the Extended Triangular Method (ETM), a generalized
contradiction-construction algorithm that formalizes and extends the internal
mechanisms of contradiction separation. The ETM unifies multiple
contradiction-building strategies, including the earlier Standard Extension
method, within a triangular geometric framework that supports flexible clause
interaction and dynamic synergy. ETM serves as the algorithmic core of several
high-performance theorem provers, CSE, CSE-E, CSI-E, and CSI-Enig, whose
competitive results in standard first-order benchmarks (TPTP problem sets and
CASC 2018-2015) empirically validate the effectiveness and generality of the
proposed approach. By bridging theoretical abstraction and operational
implementation, ETM advances the contradiction separation paradigm into a
generalized, scalable, and practically competitive model for automated
reasoning, offering new directions for future research in logical inference and
theorem proving.

### [44] [Adaptive Selection of Symbolic Languages for Improving LLM Logical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10703)
*Xiangyu Wang,Haocheng Yang,Fengxiang Cheng,Fenrong Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper improves logical reasoning in LLMs by adaptively selecting the most suitable symbolic language (SL) for translating natural language problems, achieving 96% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with logical reasoning due to dependence on accurate translation from natural language to symbolic language, and the choice of symbolic language type also plays a critical role.

Method: The paper proposes a method where LLMs adaptively select the suitable SL (from first-order logic, logic programming, and Boolean satisfiability) prior to translation, and then solve the problems using appropriate solvers.

Result: The adaptive selection method outperforms single and random SL translation methods, achieving 96% accuracy and improving performance by 25% compared to the next best approach.

Conclusion: Selecting the optimal symbolic language tailored to problem types significantly enhances logical reasoning in LLMs, demonstrating the importance of adaptive translation systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggle with complex logical reasoning.
While previous works achieve remarkable improvements, their performance is
highly dependent on the correctness of translating natural language (NL)
problems into a symbolic language (SL). Though numerous works focusing on
improving this translation accuracy, they only consider the similarity between
the meaning of SL and NL, overlooking another crucial influencing factor, the
selection of the target SL type itself. For example, first-order logic language
specializes in logical reasoning with categorical syllogisms and complex
quantifiers, while Boolean satisfiability formalism excels at representing
constraint satisfaction like partial problems. To our knowledge, this is the
first paper to claim and verify that different NL logical reasoning problem
corresponds to different optimal SL formalization for translation. Based on
this, we propose a methods to improve the logical reasoning performance of LLMs
by adaptively selecting the most suitable SL for each problem prior to
translation. Specifically, we leverage LLMs to select the target SL among
first-order logic, logic programming and Boolean satisfiability and then
translate the problem in NL to target SL expressions as well as employ the
corresponding logical solver to derive the final answer. Experimental results
on benchmarks show that our adaptive selection method significantly outperforms
translating all into single SL and randomly selecting the SL. On a mixed
dataset of these benchmarks, our approach achieves 96% accuracy, which
improving performance by 25% compared to the second highest accuracy from the
first-order logic translation.

### [45] [LLMs as Strategic Agents: Beliefs, Best Response Behavior, and Emergent Heuristics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10813)
*Enric Junque de Fortuny,Veronica Roberta Cappelli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates Large Language Models' (LLMs) ability to perform strategic thinking in games, revealing emergent meta-reasoning and heuristic formation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether LLMs can perform genuine strategic thinking, encompassing belief formation, evaluation of actions, and choices based on those beliefs, in tasks requiring reasoning about other agents.

Method: The authors developed a framework to disentangle beliefs, evaluation, and choice in static, complete-information games and used a new context-free game to prevent imitation from memorization.

Result: Current frontier LLMs demonstrate belief-coherent responses at targeted reasoning depths, while forming differentiated conjectures about opponents and employing heuristic rules under complex scenarios.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit emergent belief coherence, meta-reasoning, and unique heuristics, showcasing their potential for strategic cognition beyond traditional modeling outcomes.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to domains that require
reasoning about other agents' behavior, such as negotiation, policy design, and
market simulation, yet existing research has mostly evaluated their adherence
to equilibrium play or their exhibited depth of reasoning. Whether they display
genuine strategic thinking, understood as the coherent formation of beliefs
about other agents, evaluation of possible actions, and choice based on those
beliefs, remains unexplored. We develop a framework to identify this ability by
disentangling beliefs, evaluation, and choice in static, complete-information
games, and apply it across a series of non-cooperative environments. By jointly
analyzing models' revealed choices and reasoning traces, and introducing a new
context-free game to rule out imitation from memorization, we show that current
frontier models exhibit belief-coherent best-response behavior at targeted
reasoning depths. When unconstrained, they self-limit their depth of reasoning
and form differentiated conjectures about human and synthetic opponents,
revealing an emergent form of meta-reasoning. Under increasing complexity,
explicit recursion gives way to internally generated heuristic rules of choice
that are stable, model-specific, and distinct from known human biases. These
findings indicate that belief coherence, meta-reasoning, and novel heuristic
formation can emerge jointly from language modeling objectives, providing a
structured basis for the study of strategic cognition in artificial agents.

### [46] [DRIFT: Decompose, Retrieve, Illustrate, then Formalize Theorems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10815)
*Meiru Zhang,Philipp Borchert,Milan Gritta,Gerasimos Lampouras*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces DRIFT, a framework for decomposing informal mathematical statements to improve premise retrieval and formalization tasks, demonstrating significant performance improvements across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with automating the translation of informal mathematical statements into formal theorem-providing languages due to complexity and insufficient contextual knowledge.

Method: The authors propose DRIFT, a framework that decomposes complex mathematical statements into smaller parts, enabling better retrieval of relevant premises and illustrative theorems. This approach optimizes retrieval by targeting specific math libraries and aligns with each model's capabilities.

Result: DRIFT nearly doubles the F1 score on ProofNet compared to the baseline and significantly improves results on the out-of-distribution ConNF benchmark using different retrieval engines like GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-V3.1.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the importance of adaptive retrieval tailored to particular models in mathematical autoformalization, achieving more effective results through DRIFT's decomposition strategy.

Abstract: Automating the formalization of mathematical statements for theorem proving
remains a major challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs struggle to
identify and utilize the prerequisite mathematical knowledge and its
corresponding formal representation in languages like Lean. Current
retrieval-augmented autoformalization methods query external libraries using
the informal statement directly, but overlook a fundamental limitation:
informal mathematical statements are often complex and offer limited context on
the underlying math concepts. To address this, we introduce DRIFT, a novel
framework that enables LLMs to decompose informal mathematical statements into
smaller, more tractable ''sub-components''. This facilitates targeted retrieval
of premises from mathematical libraries such as Mathlib. Additionally, DRIFT
retrieves illustrative theorems to help models use premises more effectively in
formalization tasks. We evaluate DRIFT across diverse benchmarks (ProofNet,
ConNF, and MiniF2F-test) and find that it consistently improves premise
retrieval, nearly doubling the F1 score compared to the DPR baseline on
ProofNet. Notably, DRIFT demonstrates strong performance on the
out-of-distribution ConNF benchmark, with BEq+@10 improvements of 37.14% and
42.25% using GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-V3.1, respectively. Our analysis shows that
retrieval effectiveness in mathematical autoformalization depends heavily on
model-specific knowledge boundaries, highlighting the need for adaptive
retrieval strategies aligned with each model's capabilities.

### [47] [LLM-Empowered Agentic MAC Protocols: A Dynamic Stackelberg Game Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10895)
*Renxuan Tan,Rongpeng Li,Fei Wang,Chenghui Peng,Shaoyun Wu,Zhifeng Zhao,Honggang Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel multi-agent DRL framework using LLMs for wireless network MAC protocols, achieving high throughput, fairness, and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of existing MAC protocols in wireless networks, which suffer from poor generalizability and resilience in dynamic environments and require costly retraining.

Method: The proposed framework employs a game-theoretic approach, modeling the transmission as a multi-follower Stackelberg game. LLM-driven agents use PPO for coordination and Protocol Action Grammar (PAG) ensures reliability and efficiency.

Result: Simulations show a 77.6% improvement in throughput and a 65.2% improvement in fairness compared to traditional baselines. The framework adapts to varying numbers of users without retraining.

Conclusion: The framework successfully provides robust and adaptive MAC protocols for wireless networks, generalizing effectively to dynamic scenarios, outperforming traditional approaches in key metrics.

Abstract: Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols, essential for wireless networks, are
typically manually configured. While deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based
protocols enhance task-specified network performance, they suffer from poor
generalizability and resilience, demanding costly retraining to adapt to
dynamic environments. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a
game-theoretic LLM-empowered multi-agent DRL (MARL) framework, in which the
uplink transmission between a base station and a varying number of user
equipments is modeled as a dynamic multi-follower Stackelberg game (MFSG),
capturing the network's natural hierarchical structure. Within this game,
LLM-driven agents, coordinated through proximal policy optimization (PPO),
synthesize adaptive, semantic MAC protocols in response to network dynamics.
Protocol action grammar (PAG) is employed to ensure the reliability and
efficiency of this process. Under this system, we further analyze the existence
and convergence behavior in terms of a Stackelberg equilibrium by studying the
learning dynamics of LLM-empowered unified policies in response to changing
followers. Simulations corroborate that our framework achieves a 77.6% greater
throughput and a 65.2% fairness improvement over conventional baselines.
Besides, our framework generalizes excellently to a fluctuating number of users
without requiring retraining or architectural changes.

### [48] [PaperArena: An Evaluation Benchmark for Tool-Augmented Agentic Reasoning on Scientific Literature](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10909)
*Daoyu Wang,Mingyue Cheng,Qi Liu,Shuo Yu,Zirui Liu,Ze Guo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PaperArena introduces a benchmark to evaluate LLM agents on tasks requiring reasoning across multiple scientific papers using tools, showing current systems struggle with low accuracies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM agents are limited in handling complex research tasks across multiple scientific papers due to the absence of a dedicated benchmark.

Method: The authors designed PaperArena, a modular benchmark with tools like multimodal parsing, context retrieval, and computation to test LLM agents on cross-paper reasoning.

Result: Experimental results show LLM agents achieve only 38.78% average accuracy on general tasks and just 18.47% on harder subsets, highlighting inefficiencies.

Conclusion: Current LLM agents have significant room for improvement in multi-paper reasoning and tool orchestration, and PaperArena aims to facilitate advancements in this domain.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning on the web-scale scientific literature is a
crucial touchstone for large language model (LLM) based agents designed to
support complex knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing works are mainly
restricted to tool-free tasks within isolated papers, largely due to the lack
of a benchmark for cross-paper reasoning and multi-tool orchestration in real
research scenarios. In this work, we propose PaperArena, an evaluation
benchmark for agents to address real-world research questions that typically
require integrating information across multiple papers with the assistance of
external tools. Given a research question, agents should integrate diverse
formats across multiple papers through reasoning and interacting with
appropriate tools, thereby producing a well-grounded answer. To support
standardized evaluation, we provide a modular and extensible platform for agent
execution, offering tools such as multimodal parsing, context retrieval, and
programmatic computation. Experimental results reveal that even the most
advanced LLM powering a well-established agent system achieves merely 38.78%
average accuracy. On the hard subset, accuracy drops to only 18.47%,
highlighting great potential for improvement. We also present several empirical
findings, including that all agents tested exhibit inefficient tool usage,
often invoking more tools than necessary to solve a task. We invite the
community to adopt PaperArena to develop and evaluate more capable agents for
scientific discovery. Our code and data are available

### [49] [PoU: Proof-of-Use to Counter Tool-Call Hacking in DeepResearch Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10931)
*SHengjie Ma,Chenlong Deng,Jiaxin Mao,Jiadeng Huang,Teng Wang,Junjie Wu,Changwang Zhang,Jun wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the "Tool-Call Hacking" issue in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agents and introduces the Proof-of-Use (PoU) framework, enhancing evidence-grounded reasoning and agent performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG agents often suffer from superficial tool calls that fail to meaningfully utilize retrieved evidence, leading to repetitive reliance on sources and weak evidence grounding.

Method: The proposed PoU framework utilizes step-wise contracts involving syntactic citation validation, sensitivity rewards, and alignment objectives to ensure causal usage of evidence.

Result: PoU demonstrated improvements across seven QA benchmarks in factual accuracy, evidence faithfulness, and balancing tool usage compared to strong DeepResearch baselines.

Conclusion: Grounding retrieval-augmented agents in causal evidence usage is critical for trustworthy reasoning systems, and PoU offers a robust framework for achieving this.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) agents, such as recent
DeepResearch-style systems, extend large language models (LLMs) with autonomous
information-seeking capabilities through external tools. While reinforcement
learning (RL) has enabled impressive multi-step reasoning, we identify a
previously overlooked failure mode, Tool-Call Hacking, where agents inflate
reward signals by issuing superficially correct tool calls without genuinely
leveraging the retrieved evidence. This results in (i) mode collapse into
repetitive reliance on a single source and (ii) spurious grounding, where
answers are only weakly supported by cited content.
  To address this, we propose Proof-of-Use (PoU), an evidence-grounded RL
framework that enforces verifiable causal links between retrieved evidence,
reasoning traces, and final answers. PoU operationalizes this through a unified
step-wise contract combining syntactic citation validation, perturbation-based
sensitivity rewards, and answer-evidence alignment objectives, ensuring that
tool usage remains both interpretable and functionally grounded.
  Across seven QA benchmarks spanning in-domain, out-of-domain, and
out-of-tool-distribution settings, PoU consistently outperforms strong
DeepResearch baselines in factual accuracy, evidence faithfulness, and
tool-routing balance. These findings highlight the necessity of grounding
RL-trained agents not merely in task outcomes but in the causal use of
retrieved information, offering a principled path toward trustworthy
retrieval-augmented reasoning.

*Nilima Rao,Jagriti Srivastava,Pradeep Kumar Sharma,Hritvik Shrivastava*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a modular hybrid retrieval framework combining graph-based and semantic search methods to improve enterprise information access and contextual query reasoning by up to 80%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enterprises face challenges in retrieving relevant information from heterogeneous systems such as code repositories and wikis, especially for complex queries requiring multi-hop reasoning.

Method: The framework constructs a unified knowledge graph from parsed repositories and combines Knowledge Base Language-Augmented Models (KBLam) with graph representations and embedding-driven semantic search for both structured and unstructured data.

Result: Experiments on large-scale Git repositories show the unified framework enhances answer relevance by up to 80% compared to traditional GPT-based pipelines.

Conclusion: This modular framework provides scalable, explainable, and user-centric tools for enterprise knowledge retrieval, making it an effective solution to adaptively handle complex queries.

Abstract: Modern enterprises manage vast knowledge distributed across heterogeneous
systems such as Jira, Git repositories, Confluence, and wikis. Conventional
retrieval methods based on keyword search or static embeddings often fail to
answer complex queries that require contextual reasoning and multi-hop
inference across artifacts. We present a modular hybrid retrieval framework for
adaptive enterprise information access that integrates Knowledge Base
Language-Augmented Models (KBLam), DeepGraph representations, and
embedding-driven semantic search. The framework builds a unified knowledge
graph from parsed repositories including code, pull requests, and commit
histories, enabling semantic similarity search, structural inference, and
multi-hop reasoning. Query analysis dynamically determines the optimal
retrieval strategy, supporting both structured and unstructured data sources
through independent or fused processing. An interactive interface provides
graph visualizations, subgraph exploration, and context-aware query routing to
generate concise and explainable answers. Experiments on large-scale Git
repositories show that the unified reasoning layer improves answer relevance by
up to 80 percent compared with standalone GPT-based retrieval pipelines. By
combining graph construction, hybrid reasoning, and interactive visualization,
the proposed framework offers a scalable, explainable, and user-centric
foundation for intelligent knowledge assistants in enterprise environments.

*Wentao Wang,Heqing Zou,Tianze Luo,Rui Huang,Yutian Zhao,Zhuochen Wang,Hansheng Zhang,Chengwei Qin,Yan Wang,Lin Zhao,Huaijian Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Video-STR introduces a graph-based reinforcement learning approach for spatio-temporal reasoning, enhancing both precision and usability in applications such as VR and embodied intelligence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Multimodal Large Language Models lack precise spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities, limiting their applicability in domains requiring detailed understanding of multi-object layouts and motion.

Method: The paper proposes a graph-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) via RLVR, paired with the newly developed STV-205k dataset containing 205k QA pairs to enhance spatio-temporal reasoning in video contexts.

Result: Video-STR demonstrated superior performance with a 13% improvement on STI-Bench compared to the base model, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: The method and dataset significantly enhance spatio-temporal reasoning for Video-STR, making it a strong solution for precise reasoning tasks, with all resources to be publicly available.

Abstract: Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has demonstrated
strong semantic understanding capabilities, but struggles to perform precise
spatio-temporal understanding. Existing spatio-temporal methods primarily focus
on the video itself, while overlooking the physical information within the
video, such as multi-object layouts and motion. Such limitations restrict the
use of MLLMs in downstream applications that demand high precision, including
embodied intelligence and VR. To address this issue, we present Video-STR, a
novel graph-based reinforcement method for precise Video Spatio-Temporal
Reasoning. Building upon the capacity of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable
Reward (RLVR) to improve model abilities, we introduce a reasoning mechanism
using graph-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) method to guide the
model in inferring the underlying spatio-temporal topology of scenarios during
the thinking process. To resolve the lack of spatio-temporal training data, we
construct the STV-205k dataset with 205k question-answering pairs, covering
dynamic multi-object scenes in both indoor and outdoor environments, to support
the model training. Experiments show that Video-STR achieves state-of-the-art
results on various benchmarks, outperforming the base model by 13% on
STI-Bench, and demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach and dataset.
Code, model, and data will be released.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper revisits model interpolation for merging reasoning models, demonstrating that strategically interpolated models outperform advanced baselines in efficiency and effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore efficient and effective methods for reasoning by revisiting simple model merging techniques in contrast to sophisticated approaches.

Method: Model weights are interpolated to observe a three-stage evolutionary paradigm of reasoning performance, supplemented by extensive empirical and ablation validation.

Result: Strategically interpolated models outperformed other advanced model merging approaches in reasoning efficiency and effectiveness.

Conclusion: Model interpolation, while simple, has a structured evolutionary behavior that can be leveraged to achieve targeted and superior reasoning performance with practical implications.

Abstract: Model merging, typically on Instruct and Thinking models, has shown
remarkable performance for efficient reasoning. In this paper, we
systematically revisit the simplest merging method that interpolates two
weights directly. Particularly, we observe that model interpolation follows a
three-stage evolutionary paradigm with distinct behaviors on the reasoning
trajectory. These dynamics provide a principled guide for navigating the
performance-cost trade-off. Empirical results demonstrate that a strategically
interpolated model surprisingly surpasses sophisticated model merging baselines
on both efficiency and effectiveness. We further validate our findings with
extensive ablation studies on model layers, modules, and decoding strategies.
Ultimately, this work demystifies model interpolation and offers a practical
framework for crafting models with precisely targeted reasoning capabilities.

*Takuma Fujiu,Sho Okazaki,Kohei Kaminishi,Yuji Nakata,Shota Hamamoto,Kenshin Yokose,Tatsunori Hara,Yasushi Umeda,Jun Ota*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study develops a diagnostic ontology and maintenance-record accumulation method enabling better failure-cause inference in manufacturing systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve production efficiency by effectively identifying causes of failures in manufacturing systems.

Method: Diagnostic Knowledge Ontology and function-behavior-structure (FBS) model-based methods to structure knowledge and accumulate maintenance records.

Result: Improved inference alignment with expert-enumerated causes, particularly in challenging scenarios with sparse data or differing vocabulary.

Conclusion: The approach aids knowledge structuring for problem-solving in maintenance, with potential for broader application across engineering chains.

Abstract: In manufacturing systems, identifying the causes of failures is crucial for
maintaining and improving production efficiency. In knowledge-based
failure-cause inference, it is important that the knowledge base (1) explicitly
structures knowledge about the target system and about failures, and (2)
contains sufficiently long causal chains of failures. In this study, we
constructed Diagnostic Knowledge Ontology and proposed a
Function-Behavior-Structure (FBS) model-based maintenance-record accumulation
method based on it. Failure-cause inference using the maintenance records
accumulated by the proposed method showed better agreement with the set of
candidate causes enumerated by experts, especially in difficult cases where the
number of related cases is small and the vocabulary used differs. In the
future, it will be necessary to develop inference methods tailored to these
maintenance records, build a user interface, and carry out validation on larger
and more diverse systems. Additionally, this approach leverages the
understanding and knowledge of the target in the design phase to support
knowledge accumulation and problem solving during the maintenance phase, and it
is expected to become a foundation for knowledge sharing across the entire
engineering chain in the future.

*Andrada Iulia Prajescu,Roberto Confalonieri*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates computational argumentation for enhancing explainability in AI used in legal settings, aligning with frameworks like GDPR and AIA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI systems in legal contexts lack transparency, undermining fairness and trust. There is a need for explainability, especially in compliance with regulations like GDPR.

Method: The study analyzes various explanation strategies and focuses on computational argumentation to align AI transparency with legal reasoning and standards.

Result: The authors identify strengths and weaknesses of existing explainability methods and propose computational argumentation as an effective basis for explainable legal AI.

Conclusion: Computational argumentation meets both technical and ethical requirements for transparency in legal AI but requires further work in bias mitigation, empirical validation, and regulatory compliance.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly deployed in legal
contexts, where their opacity raises significant challenges for fairness,
accountability, and trust. The so-called ``black box problem'' undermines the
legitimacy of automated decision-making, as affected individuals often lack
access to meaningful explanations. In response, the field of Explainable AI
(XAI) has proposed a variety of methods to enhance transparency, ranging from
example-based and rule-based techniques to hybrid and argumentation-based
approaches. This paper promotes computational models of arguments and their
role in providing legally relevant explanations, with particular attention to
their alignment with emerging regulatory frameworks such as the EU General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA). We
analyze the strengths and limitations of different explanation strategies,
evaluate their applicability to legal reasoning, and highlight how
argumentation frameworks -- by capturing the defeasible, contestable, and
value-sensitive nature of law -- offer a particularly robust foundation for
explainable legal AI. Finally, we identify open challenges and research
directions, including bias mitigation, empirical validation in judicial
settings, and compliance with evolving ethical and legal standards, arguing
that computational argumentation is best positioned to meet both technical and
normative requirements of transparency in the law domain.

Method: Using a multi-level intelligent agent economic model, simulation-based comparisons were conducted between China and the U.S. under varying AI mechanisms.

Result: (1) AI operating autonomously increases social output surpassing traditional human labor systems. (2) China exhibits promising growth in intelligent agent adoption and technological progression, potentially achieving technological convergence or surpassing.

Conclusion: The study offers a systematic model-based analysis of AI-driven production transformations and its implications for global competitiveness and policy-making.

Abstract: With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology,
socio-economic systems are entering a new stage of "human-AI co-creation."
Building upon a previously established multi-level intelligent agent economic
model, this paper conducts simulation-based comparisons of macroeconomic output
evolution in China and the United States under different mechanisms-AI
collaboration, network effects, and AI autonomous production. The results show
that: (1) when AI functions as an independent productive entity, the overall
growth rate of social output far exceeds that of traditional human-labor-based
models; (2) China demonstrates clear potential for acceleration in both the
expansion of intelligent agent populations and the pace of technological
catch-up, offering the possibility of achieving technological convergence or
even partial surpassing. This study provides a systematic, model-based
analytical framework for understanding AI-driven production system
transformation and shifts in international competitiveness, as well as
quantitative insights for relevant policy formulation.

*Chuke Chen,Biao Luo,Nan Li,Boxiang Wang,Hang Yang,Jing Guo,Ming Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ARIA presents a framework for automated, interpretable data analysis by integrating AI and human inputs through natural-language specifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the gap between scientific data analysis capability and research intent, aiming to resolve issues in scalability, transparency, and reproducibility.

Method: The authors introduce ARIA, a spec-driven framework with six layers to unify human reasoning and machine execution. It uses natural-language specifications for analytical goals and autonomously generates code and documentation.

Result: ARIA demonstrated high predictive accuracy in evaluations, including identifying optimal feature sets and models, showcasing its efficiency and interpretability.

Conclusion: ARIA creates a transparent, collaborative, and reproducible paradigm for scientific discovery by combining principles of AI for research and science.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of scientific data has widened the gap between analytical
capability and research intent. Existing AI-based analysis tools, ranging from
AutoML frameworks to agentic research assistants, either favor automation over
transparency or depend on manual scripting that hinders scalability and
reproducibility. We present ARIA (Automated Research Intelligence Assistant), a
spec-driven, human-in-the-loop framework for automated and interpretable data
analysis. ARIA integrates six interoperable layers, namely Command, Context,
Code, Data, Orchestration, and AI Module, within a document-centric workflow
that unifies human reasoning and machine execution. Through natural-language
specifications, researchers define analytical goals while ARIA autonomously
generates executable code, validates computations, and produces transparent
documentation. Beyond achieving high predictive accuracy, ARIA can rapidly
identify optimal feature sets and select suitable models, minimizing redundant
tuning and repetitive experimentation. In the Boston Housing case, ARIA
discovered 25 key features and determined XGBoost as the best performing model
(R square = 0.93) with minimal overfitting. Evaluations across heterogeneous
domains demonstrate ARIA's strong performance, interpretability, and efficiency
compared with state-of-the-art systems. By combining AI for research and AI for
science principles within a spec-driven architecture, ARIA establishes a new
paradigm for transparent, collaborative, and reproducible scientific discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to help AI agents reduce uncertainty and fill knowledge gaps for efficient planning, especially for solving current and future tasks.

Method: $How^{2}$ integrates a memory agent framework allowing agents to ask, store, and reuse answers to how-to questions in interactive tasks.

Result: Evaluation in the Minecraft crafting environment (Plancraft) shows that agents perform better when answers are abstracted and decoupled from the current state.

Conclusion: $How^{2}$ enhances LLM-based agents' planning capabilities by facilitating meaningful question-asking and lifelong learning in interactive environments.

Abstract: An agent facing a planning problem can use answers to how-to questions to
reduce uncertainty and fill knowledge gaps, helping it solve both current and
future tasks. However, their open ended nature, where valid answers to "How do
I X?" range from executable actions to high-level descriptions of X's
sub-goals, makes them challenging for AI agents to ask, and for AI experts to
answer, in ways that support efficient planning. We introduce $How^{2}$, a
memory agent framework that enables agents to ask how-to questions, store the
answers, and reuse them for lifelong learning in interactive environments. We
evaluate our approach in Plancraft, a Minecraft crafting environment, where
agents must complete an assembly task by manipulating inventory items. Using
teacher models that answer at varying levels of abstraction, from executable
action sequences to high-level subgoal descriptions, we show that lifelong
learning agents benefit most from answers that are abstracted and decoupled
from the current state. $How^{2}$ offers a way for LLM-based agents to improve
their planning capabilities over time by asking questions in interactive
environments.

### [58] [Aligning Deep Implicit Preferences by Learning to Reason Defensively](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11194)
*Peiming Li,Zhiyuan Hu,Yang Tang,Shiyu Li,Xi Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CDRA proposes a novel alignment approach for LLMs redefining alignment as a structured reasoning process to address user implicit preferences and defensive reasoning gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods fail to infer deep implicit user preferences and lack robust, defensive reasoning capabilities, causing superficial and brittle LLM responses.

Method: CDRA introduces the DeepPref dataset and utilizes the Pers-GenPRM reward model for critique-driven policy alignment using reasoning chains and reinforcement learning.

Result: Experiments show CDRA effectively uncovers and aligns with true user preferences while demonstrating robust reasoning.

Conclusion: CDRA enhances LLM alignment to overcome cognitive gaps by leveraging structured reasoning processes and personalized reward modeling.

Abstract: Personalized alignment is crucial for enabling Large Language Models (LLMs)
to engage effectively in user-centric interactions. However, current methods
face a dual challenge: they fail to infer users' deep implicit preferences
(including unstated goals, semantic context and risk tolerances), and they lack
the defensive reasoning required to navigate real-world ambiguity. This
cognitive gap leads to responses that are superficial, brittle and
short-sighted. To address this, we propose Critique-Driven Reasoning Alignment
(CDRA), which reframes alignment from a scalar reward-matching task into a
structured reasoning process. First, to bridge the preference inference gap, we
introduce the DeepPref benchmark. This dataset, comprising 3000
preference-query pairs across 20 topics, is curated by simulating a
multi-faceted cognitive council that produces critique-annotated reasoning
chains to deconstruct query semantics and reveal latent risks. Second, to
instill defensive reasoning, we introduce the Personalized Generative Process
Reward Model (Pers-GenPRM), which frames reward modeling as a personalized
reasoning task. It generates a critique chain to evaluate a response's
alignment with user preferences before outputting a final score based on this
rationale. Ultimately, this interpretable, structured reward signal guides
policy model through Critique-Driven Policy Alignment, a process-level online
reinforcement learning algorithm integrating both numerical and natural
language feedback. Experiments demonstrate that CDRA excels at discovering and
aligning with users' true preferences while executing robust reasoning. Our
code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Zephyrian-Hugh/Deep-pref.

### [59] [AI Alignment Strategies from a Risk Perspective: Independent Safety Mechanisms or Shared Failures?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11235)
*Leonard Dung,Florian Mai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper studies redundancy and failure mode correlation in AI alignment techniques and their implications on overall AI safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI alignment research seeks to ensure AI systems do not cause harm, but no single alignment technique is failproof. Hence, a defense-in-depth approach is employed to reduce risk through redundant protections.

Method: The authors analyzed 7 representative alignment techniques and 7 failure modes to study overlap and correlations in their failure points.

Result: The study evaluates how correlated the failure modes of different alignment techniques are, which directly impacts the efficacy of the defense-in-depth strategy.

Conclusion: The paper provides insights into current risks in AI alignment, suggesting that understanding failure mode correlations can guide prioritization in AI safety research.

Abstract: AI alignment research aims to develop techniques to ensure that AI systems do
not cause harm. However, every alignment technique has failure modes, which are
conditions in which there is a non-negligible chance that the technique fails
to provide safety. As a strategy for risk mitigation, the AI safety community
has increasingly adopted a defense-in-depth framework: Conceding that there is
no single technique which guarantees safety, defense-in-depth consists in
having multiple redundant protections against safety failure, such that safety
can be maintained even if some protections fail. However, the success of
defense-in-depth depends on how (un)correlated failure modes are across
alignment techniques. For example, if all techniques had the exact same failure
modes, the defense-in-depth approach would provide no additional protection at
all. In this paper, we analyze 7 representative alignment techniques and 7
failure modes to understand the extent to which they overlap. We then discuss
our results' implications for understanding the current level of risk and how
to prioritize AI alignment research in the future.

*Deepeka Garg,Sihan Zeng,Annapoorani L. Narayanan,Sumitra Ganesh,Leo Ardon*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PADME is introduced as a framework to improve autonomous task execution by transforming procedural texts into structured graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of intelligent agents struggling with executing long-horizon procedures from free-form natural language instructions due to their variability and lack of structure.

Method: PADME employs a two-phase methodology (Teach and Execute). The Teach phase focuses on graph construction and logic enrichment, while the Execute phase handles dynamic execution based on inputs and feedback.

Result: Empirical results showcased PADME achieving state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks like ALFWorld and ScienceWorld.

Conclusion: Structured graph-based procedure modeling with PADME enhances reliable and generalizable execution capabilities for intelligent agents.

Abstract: Learning to autonomously execute long-horizon procedures from natural
language remains a core challenge for intelligent agents. Free-form
instructions such as recipes, scientific protocols, or business workflows
encode rich procedural knowledge, but their variability and lack of structure
cause agents driven by large language models (LLMs) to drift or fail during
execution. We introduce Procedure Aware DynaMic Execution (PADME), an agent
framework that produces and exploits a graph-based representation of
procedures. Unlike prior work that relies on manual graph construction or
unstructured reasoning, PADME autonomously transforms procedural text into
executable graphs that capture task dependencies, decision points, and reusable
subroutines. Central to PADME is a two-phase methodology; Teach phase, which
focuses on systematic structuring, enrichment with executable logic of
procedures, followed by Execute phase, which enables dynamic execution in
response to real-time inputs and environment feedback. This separation ensures
quality assurance and scalability, allowing expert knowledge to be encoded once
and reliably reused across varying contexts. The graph representation also
provides an inductive bias that reduces error accumulation in long-horizon
reasoning, underscoring the importance of structured procedure modeling for
reliable agent-driven automation. Empirically, PADME achieves state-of-the-art
performance on four diverse benchmarks, including ALFWorld and ScienceWorld.
These results demonstrate that agents equipped with graph-based procedure
representations offer a powerful intermediate abstraction for robust and
generalizable execution.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes AI-Agent School (AAS), a system leveraging self-evolving agents to simulate complex educational dynamics, addressing limitations in teacher-student interaction modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the simulation of complex human educational systems and interactions, overcoming current limitations in modeling diverse educational participants.

Method: AAS employs Zero-Exp strategy with an 'experience-reflection-optimization' cycle using dual memory bases (experience and knowledge), enabling agents to evolve autonomously through interactions in simulated school scenarios.

Result: AAS successfully simulates intricate educational dynamics and fosters advanced cognitive abilities in agents, demonstrating its effectiveness in modeling teacher-student engagements.

Conclusion: AAS represents a foundational step towards advancing simulation-based frameworks for educational systems, bridging the 'Era of Experience' to the 'Era of Simulation.'

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based Agents are increasingly pivotal in
simulating and understanding complex human systems and interactions. We propose
the AI-Agent School (AAS) system, built around a self-evolving mechanism that
leverages agents for simulating complex educational dynamics. Addressing the
fragmented issues in teaching process modeling and the limitations of agents
performance in simulating diverse educational participants, AAS constructs the
Zero-Exp strategy, employs a continuous "experience-reflection-optimization"
cycle, grounded in a dual memory base comprising experience and knowledge bases
and incorporating short-term and long-term memory components. Through this
mechanism, agents autonomously evolve via situated interactions within diverse
simulated school scenarios. This evolution enables agents to more accurately
model the nuanced, multi-faceted teacher-student engagements and underlying
learning processes found in physical schools. Experiment confirms that AAS can
effectively simulate intricate educational dynamics and is effective in
fostering advanced agent cognitive abilities, providing a foundational stepping
stone from the "Era of Experience" to the "Era of Simulation" by generating
high-fidelity behavioral and interaction data.

*Le Ngoc Luyen,Marie-Hélène Abel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores automated skill decomposition using LLMs, introduces evaluation metrics, and provides a comprehensive framework for ontology-based analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create a standardized framework for evaluating skill decomposition processes using Large Language Models in alignment with ontology nodes.

Method: The authors propose a pipeline involving prompting, generation, normalization, and alignment with ontology nodes, along with two new evaluation metrics: semantic F1-score and hierarchy-aware F1-score. They compare zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies in LLMs.

Result: Few-shot prompting stabilizes phrasing and granularity and outperforms zero-shot in hierarchy-aware alignment, while also showing competitive latency.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a reproducible foundation for skill decomposition systems aligned with structured ontologies, using their framework and metrics.

Abstract: This paper investigates automated skill decomposition using Large Language
Models (LLMs) and proposes a rigorous, ontology-grounded evaluation framework.
Our framework standardizes the pipeline from prompting and generation to
normalization and alignment with ontology nodes. To evaluate outputs, we
introduce two metrics: a semantic F1-score that uses optimal embedding-based
matching to assess content accuracy, and a hierarchy-aware F1-score that
credits structurally correct placements to assess granularity. We conduct
experiments on ROME-ESCO-DecompSkill, a curated subset of parents, comparing
two prompting strategies: zero-shot and leakage-safe few-shot with exemplars.
Across diverse LLMs, zero-shot offers a strong baseline, while few-shot
consistently stabilizes phrasing and granularity and improves hierarchy-aware
alignment. A latency analysis further shows that exemplar-guided prompts are
competitive - and sometimes faster - than unguided zero-shot due to more
schema-compliant completions. Together, the framework, benchmark, and metrics
provide a reproducible foundation for developing ontology-faithful skill
decomposition systems.

### [64] [From <Answer> to <Think>: Multidimensional Supervision of Reasoning Process for LLM Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11457)
*Beining Wang,Weihang Su,Hongtao Tian,Tao Yang,Yujia Zhou,Ting Yao,Qingyao Ai,Yiqun Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel supervision framework, Dimension-level Reward Model (DRM), to improve reasoning in Large Language Models by evaluating beyond final answers using three dimensions: Confidence, Relevance, and Coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional outcome-supervised reinforcement learning (RLVR) rewards models only for correct final answers, leading to sparse reward signals and flawed reasoning propagation, while process-level reward models (PRMs) provide step-by-step feedback but lack generalizability and interpretability.

Method: The authors propose DRM, which assesses reasoning quality through three dimensions (Confidence, Relevance, and Coherence) that capture complementary and interpretable aspects of reasoning without requiring ground truth answers.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that DRM provides effective supervision signals, improving LLM's reasoning capabilities and yielding consistent performance gains across in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks, including mathematics, QA, coding, and puzzles.

Conclusion: Multidimensional supervision via DRM can enhance LLMs' generalized reasoning abilities beyond the training distribution, addressing limitations of previous models like RLVR and PRMs.

Abstract: Improving the multi-step reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
a critical yet challenging task. The dominant paradigm, outcome-supervised
reinforcement learning (RLVR), rewards only correct final answers, often
propagating flawed reasoning and suffering from sparse reward signals. While
process-level reward models (PRMs) provide denser, step-by-step feedback, they
lack generalizability and interpretability, requiring task-specific
segmentation of the reasoning process. To this end, we propose the
Dimension-level Reward Model (DRM), a new supervision framework that bridges
the gap between these two approaches. DRM evaluates the quality of a reasoning
process along three fundamental, complementary, and interpretable dimensions:
Confidence for uncertainty calibration, Relevance for semantic alignment, and
Coherence for logical consistency. Together, these dimensions capture aspects
beyond final answer correctness and enable interpretable assessment without
requiring ground truth answers. Experimental results show that DRM provides
effective supervision signals, guides the optimization of LLMs and enhances
their reasoning ability. In particular, DRM-supervised training achieves
consistent gains on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution open-domain
tasks, including mathematics, question answering, code execution, and puzzles.
Our findings demonstrate that multidimensional supervision of the reasoning
process can improve the generalized reasoning ability of LLMs beyond the
training distribution.

*Yisen Gao,Jiaxin Bai,Yi Huang,Xingcheng Fu,Qingyun Sun,Yangqiu Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces DARK, a framework unifying deductive and abductive reasoning for knowledge graphs, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods treat deductive and abductive reasoning on knowledge graphs separately, missing their synergistic potential.

Method: DARK employs a masked diffusion model with a self-reflective denoising process for hypothesis validation and reinforcement learning for exploring logical associations.

Result: DARK achieves state-of-the-art performance in both deductive and abductive reasoning tasks on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: DARK showcases the advantages of a unified approach, bridging the gap between deductive and abductive reasoning in knowledge graphs.

Abstract: Deductive and abductive reasoning are two critical paradigms for analyzing
knowledge graphs, enabling applications from financial query answering to
scientific discovery. Deductive reasoning on knowledge graphs usually involves
retrieving entities that satisfy a complex logical query, while abductive
reasoning generates plausible logical hypotheses from observations. Despite
their clear synergistic potential, where deduction can validate hypotheses and
abduction can uncover deeper logical patterns, existing methods address them in
isolation. To bridge this gap, we propose DARK, a unified framework for
Deductive and Abductive Reasoning in Knowledge graphs. As a masked diffusion
model capable of capturing the bidirectional relationship between queries and
conclusions, DARK has two key innovations. First, to better leverage deduction
for hypothesis refinement during abductive reasoning, we introduce a
self-reflective denoising process that iteratively generates and validates
candidate hypotheses against the observed conclusion. Second, to discover
richer logical associations, we propose a logic-exploration reinforcement
learning approach that simultaneously masks queries and conclusions, enabling
the model to explore novel reasoning compositions. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmark knowledge graphs show that DARK achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both deductive and abductive reasoning tasks, demonstrating the
significant benefits of our unified approach.

Motivation: To address privacy and compliance challenges in healthcare and finance industries due to the surge in AI enterprise assistants, and explore how zero data retention policies can enhance data protection.

Method: Analyzing the architectural, compliance, and usability trade-offs in commercial AI assistants developed by Salesforce and Microsoft, as well as policies implemented by large language model providers.

Result: Salesforce AgentForce and Microsoft Copilot demonstrate distinct technical approaches to achieving zero data retention, showcasing the implementation by consuming applications and service providers.

Conclusion: Zero data retention policies are vital in safeguarding business data, and the paper provides insights into how major industry players deploy these policies to manage privacy and compliance effectively.

Abstract: Governance of data, compliance, and business privacy matters, particularly
for healthcare and finance businesses. Since the recent emergence of AI
enterprise AI assistants enhancing business productivity, safeguarding private

commercial AI assistants with two industry leaders and market titans in this
arena - Salesforce and Microsoft. Both of these companies used distinct
technical architecture to support zero data retention policies. Salesforce
AgentForce and Microsoft Copilot are among the leading AI assistants providing
much-needed push to business productivity in customer care. The purpose of this

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces methods to optimize LLM-based agent systems by embedding complex business policy documents into model priors through a novel approach called CAP-CPT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large policy documents in LLM agentic systems lead to high computational overhead, necessitating efficient internalization methods to preserve performance while reducing complexity.

Method: The authors developed CC-Gen, a benchmark for complexity evaluation, coupled with CAP-CPT, an automated pretraining pipeline categorizing policy specifications and guiding data synthesis.

Result: CAP-CPT reduces prompt length by 97.3% on CC-Gen, achieves significant performance improvements of up to 41% and 22% in baseline settings, and enhances tau-Bench results with minimal supervised fine-tuning.

Conclusion: CAP-CPT effectively internalizes complex policy information, alleviating computational and reasoning burdens, and demonstrates strong gains in performance and scalability for policy-driven LLM systems.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agentic systems rely on in-context policy
documents encoding diverse business rules. As requirements grow, these
documents expand rapidly, causing high computational overhead. This motivates
developing internalization methods that embed policy documents into model
priors while preserving performance. Prior prompt compression work targets
generic prompts, but agentic policy documents span multiple complexity levels
and require deeper reasoning, making internalization harder. We introduce
CC-Gen, an agentic benchmark generator with Controllable Complexity across four
levels, enabling systematic evaluation of agents' ability to handle complexity
and offering a unified framework for assessing policy internalization. Our
analysis shows that complex policy specifications governing workflows pose
major reasoning challenges. Supporting internalization with gold user agent
interaction trajectories containing chain-of-thought (CoT) annotations via
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is data-intensive and degrades sharply as policy
complexity increases. To mitigate data and reasoning burdens, we propose
Category-Aware Policy Continued Pretraining (CAP-CPT). Our automated pipeline
parses policy documents to extract key specifications, grouping them into
factual, behavioral, and conditional categories, and isolating complex
conditions that drive workflow complexity. This guides targeted data synthesis
and enables agents to internalize policy information through an autoregressive
pretraining loss. Experiments show CAP-CPT improves SFT baselines in all
settings, with up to 41% and 22% gains on Qwen-3-32B, achieving 97.3% prompt
length reduction on CC-Gen and further enhancing tau-Bench with minimal SFT
data.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues that AI policy effectiveness is hindered by poor reproducibility in research and proposes stricter reproducibility protocols to support better governance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current AI information environment, characterized by low-quality signals and lack of scientific rigor, undermines policymakers’ ability to prioritize and address risks effectively.

Method: The authors evaluate the 'reproducibility crisis' in AI by comparing it to similar crises faced by other scientific fields, suggesting standards like preregistration, higher statistical rigor, and encouragement of negative result publications.

Result: Adopting stricter reproducibility protocols can align AI research with governance needs, reduce uncertainty, and improve policymaker capacity to establish meaningful AI policies.

Conclusion: Stricter reproducibility standards in AI research are essential for enabling effective governance and ensuring safer, more aligned AI systems.

Abstract: AI policymakers are responsible for delivering effective governance
mechanisms that can provide safe, aligned and trustworthy AI development.
However, the information environment offered to policymakers is characterised
by an unnecessarily low Signal-To-Noise Ratio, favouring regulatory capture and
creating deep uncertainty and divides on which risks should be prioritised from
a governance perspective. We posit that the current publication speeds in AI
combined with the lack of strong scientific standards, via weak reproducibility
protocols, effectively erodes the power of policymakers to enact meaningful
policy and governance protocols. Our paper outlines how AI research could adopt
stricter reproducibility guidelines to assist governance endeavours and improve
consensus on the AI risk landscape. We evaluate the forthcoming reproducibility
crisis within AI research through the lens of crises in other scientific
domains; providing a commentary on how adopting preregistration, increased
statistical power and negative result publication reproducibility protocols can
enable effective AI governance. While we maintain that AI governance must be
reactive due to AI's significant societal implications we argue that
policymakers and governments must consider reproducibility protocols as a core
tool in the governance arsenal and demand higher standards for AI research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework integrating explainable AI, survival analysis, and RFM profiling for understanding and addressing customer churn.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High customer acquisition costs make retention a priority, but existing churn models lack interpretability, limiting actionable insights.

Method: A combination framework using explainable AI for feature contributions, survival analysis for churn timing, and RFM profiling for segmentation.

Result: The framework offers actionable insights by attributing churn causes, identifying retention timing, and prioritizing high-risk customer segments.

Conclusion: The approach supports designing effective strategies to reduce churn and enhance customer loyalty.

Abstract: In online retail, customer acquisition typically incurs higher costs than
customer retention, motivating firms to invest in churn analytics. However,
many contemporary churn models operate as opaque black boxes, limiting insight
into the determinants of attrition, the timing of retention opportunities, and
the identification of high-risk customer segments. Accordingly, the emphasis
should shift from prediction alone to the design of personalized retention
strategies grounded in interpretable evidence. This study advances a
three-component framework that integrates explainable AI to quantify feature
contributions, survival analysis to model time-to-event churn risk, and RFM
profiling to segment customers by transactional behaviour. In combination,
these methods enable the attribution of churn drivers, estimation of
intervention windows, and prioritization of segments for targeted actions,
thereby supporting strategies that reduce attrition and strengthen customer
loyalty.

Motivation: To address the lack of focus on time efficiency in parallel and asynchronous operations in existing agent benchmarks.

Method: They propose ParaCook, a simplified cooking-based environment to measure collaborative and time-efficient planning ability of multi-agent systems.

Result: Results show that current LLM approaches produce suboptimal plans and face challenges in parallel action coordination, but they perform better on abstract high-level optimization tasks.

Conclusion: ParaCook sets a foundation for developing frameworks aimed at enhancing time-efficient multi-agent planning, filling a critical gap in collaborative benchmarks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning abilities for planning
long-horizon, real-world tasks, yet existing agent benchmarks focus on task
completion while neglecting time efficiency in parallel and asynchronous
operations. To address this, we present ParaCook, a benchmark for
time-efficient collaborative planning. Inspired by the Overcooked game,
ParaCook provides an environment for various challenging interaction planning
of multi-agent systems that are instantiated as cooking tasks, with a
simplified action space to isolate the core challenge of strategic parallel
planning. Through a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs, we find
that current approaches achieve suboptimal plans, which struggle with parallel
actions or coordination. Our analysis also reveals LLMs' potential on abstract
tasks where they can focus on high-level parallel optimization. ParaCook
provides a scalable evaluation framework with adjustable complexity,
establishing a foundation for developing and assessing time efficiency-aware
multi-agent planning. The code and data are available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limited role of LLMs in scientific equation discovery, traditionally constrained to proposing equations within other search algorithms.

Method: The framework employs LLMs wrapped with a code interpreter that includes tools for data analysis and equation evaluation. The agent autonomously optimizes equations using these tools, reinforced by an end-to-end reinforcement learning approach.

Result: SR-Scientist demonstrated superior performance compared to baseline methods across four scientific disciplines, achieving absolute margin improvements of 6%-35%. Results showcased robustness to noise, generalization to out-of-domain data, and symbolic accuracy.

Conclusion: SR-Scientist offers a significant advance in scientific equation discovery, elevating LLMs into autonomous AI scientists capable of end-to-end data-driven hypothesis generation and equation optimization, reducing reliance on predefined human pipelines.

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been applied to scientific
equation discovery, leveraging their embedded scientific knowledge for
hypothesis generation. However, current methods typically confine LLMs to the
role of an equation proposer within search algorithms like genetic programming.
In this paper, we present SR-Scientist, a framework that elevates the LLM from
a simple equation proposer to an autonomous AI scientist that writes code to
analyze data, implements the equation as code, submits it for evaluation, and
optimizes the equation based on experimental feedback. Specifically, we wrap
the code interpreter into a set of tools for data analysis and equation
evaluation. The agent is instructed to optimize the equation by utilizing these
tools over a long horizon with minimal human-defined pipelines. Empirical
results show that SR-Scientist outperforms baseline methods by an absolute
margin of 6% to 35% on datasets covering four science disciplines.
Additionally, we demonstrate our method's robustness to noise, the
generalization of the discovered equations to out-of-domain data, and their
symbolic accuracy. Furthermore, we develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning
framework to enhance the agent's capabilities.

of 0.3956 +/- 0.0565 across 75 problems -- the highest recorded performance
among all evaluated systems to date. The architecture demonstrates that a
linear, non-blocking agent, operating autonomously within a controlled IDE
environment, can outperform multi-agent and orchestrated systems under
identical constraints.

TL;DR: The paper highlights the importance of integrating domain-specific safety measures in mental health applications by applying Constitutional AI (CAI) principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing demand for scalable, AI-driven mental health solutions while ensuring specialized safety measures due to the sensitive nature of this domain.

Method: The authors propose utilizing Constitutional AI training tailored with mental health-specific principles to create safer, domain-adapted AI systems.

Result: The paper introduces a framework for extending CAI to mental health applications to better handle challenges like crisis intervention, misinformation prevention, and adaptability to nuanced dialogues.

Conclusion: Domain-specific safety mechanisms are essential for AI applications in mental health, and Constitutional AI training provides a promising direction for addressing these unique challenges.

Abstract: Mental health applications have emerged as a critical area in computational
health, driven by rising global rates of mental illness, the integration of AI
in psychological care, and the need for scalable solutions in underserved
communities. These include therapy chatbots, crisis detection, and wellness
platforms handling sensitive data, requiring specialized AI safety beyond
general safeguards due to emotional vulnerability, risks like misdiagnosis or
symptom exacerbation, and precise management of vulnerable states to avoid
severe outcomes such as self-harm or loss of trust. Despite AI safety advances,
general safeguards inadequately address mental health-specific challenges,
including crisis intervention accuracy to avert escalations, therapeutic
guideline adherence to prevent misinformation, scale limitations in
resource-constrained settings, and adaptation to nuanced dialogues where
generics may introduce biases or miss distress signals. We introduce an
approach to apply Constitutional AI training with domain-specific mental health
principles for safe, domain-adapted CAI systems in computational mental health
applications.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: ISAAC introduces a novel CPU verification framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) and FPGA acceleration, targeting bottlenecks in stimulus generation and simulation to detect elusive bugs and achieve significant speed-ups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Functional verification of CPUs is time-intensive and hindered by bottlenecks in current testing frameworks, including low-quality stimulus generation and limited simulation visibility, delaying debugging cycles.

Method: ISAAC integrates a multi-agent LLM-based stimulus engine with micro-architectural knowledge for targeted testing, combined with a decoupled co-simulation architecture exploiting FPGA parallelism to boost simulation throughput.

Result: Using ISAAC on a mature CPU, results showed up to 17,536x simulation speed-up relative to software RTL simulation and discovery of previously unknown bugs.

Conclusion: ISAAC significantly accelerates CPU verification, enhances bug detection, and provides a scalable solution to the challenges faced in current frameworks.

Abstract: Functional verification is a critical bottleneck in integrated circuit
development, with CPU verification being especially time-intensive and
labour-consuming. Industrial practice relies on differential testing for CPU
verification, yet faces bottlenecks at nearly each stage of the framework
pipeline: front-end stimulus generation lacks micro-architectural awareness,
yielding low-quality and redundant tests that impede coverage closure and miss
corner cases. Meanwhile, back-end simulation infrastructure, even with FPGA
acceleration, often stalls on long-running tests and offers limited visibility,
delaying feedback and prolonging the debugging cycle. Here, we present ISAAC, a
full-stack, Large Language Model (LLM)-aided CPU verification framework with
FPGA parallelism, from bug categorisation and stimulus generation to simulation
infrastructure. To do so, we presented a multi-agent stimulus engine in ISAAC's
front-end, infused with micro-architectural knowledge and historical bug
patterns, generating highly targeted tests that rapidly achieve coverage goals
and capture elusive corner cases. In ISAAC's back-end, we introduce a
lightweight forward-snapshot mechanism and a decoupled co-simulation
architecture between the Instruction Set Simulator (ISS) and the Design Under
Test (DUT), enabling a single ISS to drive multiple DUTs in parallel. By
eliminating long-tail test bottlenecks and exploiting FPGA parallelism, the
simulation throughput is significantly improved. As a demonstration, we used
ISAAC to verify a mature CPU that has undergone multiple successful tape-outs.
Results show up to 17,536x speed-up over software RTL simulation, while
detecting several previously unknown bugs, two of which are reported in this
paper.

Abstract: Transformers are at the core of modern AI nowadays. They rely heavily on
matrix multiplication and require efficient acceleration due to their
substantial memory and computational requirements. Quantization plays a vital
role in reducing memory usage, and can be exploited for computations by
designing reconfigurable architectures that enhance matrix multiplication by

adaptive-precision processing elements (PEs) and shared accumulators. ADiP
supports multiple computation modes, including symmetric single-matrix
multiplication as well as asymmetric multi-matrix multiplication with a shared
input matrix, thereby improving data-reuse and PE utilization. In addition,
ADiP maximizes the computational density by adapting to different precisions,
such as 8bitx8bit, 8bitx4bit, and 8bitx2bit. Analytical models are developed
for ADiP architecture, including latency and throughput for versatile
architecture configurations. A comprehensive hardware design space exploration
is demonstrated using 22nm commercial technology, achieving up to a 4x higher
computational throughput. Furthermore, ADiP is evaluated on different
transformer workloads from GPT-2 Medium, BERT Large, and BitNet-1.58B models,
delivering latency improvement up to 53.6%, and energy improvement up to 24.4%
for BitNet-1.58B MHA workloads. At a 64x64 size with 4096 PEs, ADiP achieves a
peak throughput of 8.192 TOPS, 16.384 TOPS, and 32.768 TOPS for 8bitx8bit,
8bitx4bit, and 8bitx2bit operations, respectively.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper proposes an innovative in-storage computing (ISP) architecture using 3D Ferroelectric NAND (FeNAND) combined with hyperdimensional computing (HDC) for efficient, energy-saving mass spectrometry (MS) data processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing demand for efficient processing of massive MS datasets, a key factor in drug discovery, challenges traditional processors' limitations, making ISP a necessary advancement.

Method: A novel FeNAND ISP architecture was developed, integrating hyperdimensional computing (HDC) and a dual-bound approximate matching (D-BAM) metric to enhance parallel processing and error tolerance.

Result: The approach achieved a 43x speedup and 21x higher energy efficiency compared to state-of-the-art 3D NAND, maintaining comparable accuracy in MS spectral searches.

Conclusion: The proposed FeNAND-based ISP with HDC presents a scalable, energy-efficient solution for large-scale MS data processing, positioning it as a superior alternative to traditional NAND approaches.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of mass spectrometry (MS) data, now exceeding hundreds of
terabytes, poses significant challenges for efficient, large-scale library
search - a critical component for drug discovery. Traditional processors
struggle to handle this data volume efficiently, making in-storage computing
(ISP) a promising alternative. This work introduces an ISP architecture
leveraging a 3D Ferroelectric NAND (FeNAND) structure, providing significantly
higher density, faster speeds, and lower voltage requirements compared to
traditional NAND flash. Despite its superior density, the NAND structure has
not been widely utilized in ISP applications due to limited throughput
associated with row-by-row reads from serially connected cells. To overcome
these limitations, we integrate hyperdimensional computing (HDC), a
brain-inspired paradigm that enables highly parallel processing with simple
operations and strong error tolerance. By combining HDC with the proposed
dual-bound approximate matching (D-BAM) distance metric, tailored to the FeNAND
structure, we parallelize vector computations to enable efficient MS spectral
library search, achieving 43x speedup and 21x higher energy efficiency over
state-of-the-art 3D NAND methods, while maintaining comparable accuracy.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This paper introduces an automated framework to optimize sparse LLM inference on Compute-in-Memory (CIM) architectures, addressing poor utilization and efficiency issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying LLMs on resource-constrained systems while maintaining acceptable performance is challenging due to the inherent memory-bound nature of traditional architectures.

Method: The proposed framework utilizes novel mapping and scheduling strategies to efficiently map sparse LLM structures with block-diagonal sparsity onto CIM arrays.

Result: The framework improves CIM array utilization by over 50%, reduces memory footprint by over 4x, and decreases required floating-point operations.

Conclusion: Optimizing sparse LLMs for CIM architectures results in significant computational and memory efficiency gains, making these frameworks viable for resource-limited applications.

Abstract: Structured sparsity enables deploying large language models (LLMs) on
resource-constrained systems. Approaches like dense-to-sparse fine-tuning are
particularly compelling, achieving remarkable structured sparsity by reducing
the model size by over 6.7x, while still maintaining acceptable accuracy.
Despite this reduction, LLM inference, especially the decode stage being
inherently memory-bound, is extremely expensive on conventional Von-Neumann
architectures. Compute-in-memory (CIM) architectures mitigate this by
performing computations directly in memory, and when paired with sparse LLMs,
enable storing and computing the entire model in memory, eliminating the data
movement on the off-chip bus and improving efficiency. Nonetheless, naively
mapping sparse matrices onto CIM arrays leads to poor array utilization and
diminished computational efficiency. In this paper, we present an automated
framework with novel mapping and scheduling strategies to accelerate sparse LLM
inference on CIM accelerators. By exploiting block-diagonal sparsity, our
approach improves CIM array utilization by over 50%, achieving more than 4x
reduction in both memory footprint and the number of required floating-point
operations.

*Yanran Chen,Lynn Greschner,Roman Klinger,Michael Klenk,Steffen Eger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study investigates the interplay between emotional framing, logical fallacies, and convincingness using large language models (LLMs). It finds that emotional appeals can decrease human ability to detect fallacies and heighten perceived convincingness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Logical fallacies in public communication can mislead audiences, and the impact of emotional framing on their perceived convincingness has not been studied computationally.

Method: The authors benchmark eight large language models (LLMs) for adding emotional appeal to fallacious arguments while maintaining logical structure. Top-performing LLMs generate stimuli for a human study on fallacy detection and emotional impact.

Result: LLM-driven emotional framing reduces human fallacy detection by 14.5% in F1 scores. Emotional states like enjoyment, fear, and sadness increase the perceived convincingness of fallacies compared to neutral states.

Conclusion: Emotional manipulation via AI has significant implications for enhancing the convincingness of fallacious arguments, posing ethical challenges in public communication.

Abstract: Logical fallacies are common in public communication and can mislead
audiences; fallacious arguments may still appear convincing despite lacking
soundness, because convincingness is inherently subjective. We present the
first computational study of how emotional framing interacts with fallacies and
convincingness, using large language models (LLMs) to systematically change
emotional appeals in fallacious arguments. We benchmark eight LLMs on injecting
emotional appeal into fallacious arguments while preserving their logical
structures, then use the best models to generate stimuli for a human study. Our
results show that LLM-driven emotional framing reduces human fallacy detection
in F1 by 14.5% on average. Humans perform better in fallacy detection when
perceiving enjoyment than fear or sadness, and these three emotions also
correlate with significantly higher convincingness compared to neutral or other
emotion states. Our work has implications for AI-driven emotional manipulation
in the context of fallacious argumentation.

*Shin-nosuke Ishikawa,Masato Todo,Taiki Ogihara,Hirotsugu Ohba*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper discusses large language models' (LLMs) tendency to identify incorrect patterns in number sequences, emphasizing the need to address their logical inconsistencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to assess the logical consistency and self-coherence of LLMs, which are essential for their application in complex, multi-step real-world tasks.

Method: The authors tested LLMs by asking them to identify patterns in integer sequences, including arithmetic, geometric, and randomly generated ones. They evaluated the ability of models like OpenAI (o3, o4-mini) and Google Gemini 2.5 to reason logically and maintain consistency.

Result: LLMs accurately identified patterns in structured sequences but frequently misidentified non-existent patterns in random sequences, showcasing a significant flaw even in advanced reasoning models.

Conclusion: The study reveals limitations in LLMs' logical reasoning capabilities, raising concerns for their use in tasks heavily reliant on logical consistency and coherence.

Abstract: We present a tendency of large language models (LLMs) to generate absurd
patterns despite their clear inappropriateness in a simple task of identifying
regularities in number series. Several approaches have been proposed to apply
LLMs to complex real-world tasks, such as providing knowledge through
retrieval-augmented generation and executing multi-step tasks using AI agent
frameworks. However, these approaches rely on the logical consistency and
self-coherence of LLMs, making it crucial to evaluate these aspects and
consider potential countermeasures. To identify cases where LLMs fail to
maintain logical consistency, we conducted an experiment in which LLMs were
asked to explain the patterns in various integer sequences, ranging from
arithmetic sequences to randomly generated integer series. While the models
successfully identified correct patterns in arithmetic and geometric sequences,
they frequently over-recognized patterns that were inconsistent with the given
numbers when analyzing randomly generated series. This issue was observed even
in multi-step reasoning models, including OpenAI o3, o4-mini, and Google Gemini
2.5 Flash Preview Thinking. This tendency to perceive non-existent patterns can
be interpreted as the AI model equivalent of Idola Tribus and highlights
potential limitations in their capability for applied tasks requiring logical
reasoning, even when employing chain-of-thought reasoning mechanisms.

*Xiaonan Si,Meilin Zhu,Simeng Qin,Lijia Yu,Lijun Zhang,Shuaitong Liu,Xinfeng Li,Ranjie Duan,Yang Liu,Xiaojun Jia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the SeCon-RAG framework, a two-stage approach to improve retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems' robustness and trustworthiness against corpus poisoning and contamination attacks. It incorporates entity-intent-relation extraction (EIRE) into semantic and conflict-aware filtering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG systems are vulnerable to knowledge contamination and corpus poisoning attacks, which compromise the reliability of their outputs. Existing solutions often result in loss of valuable information, leading to the need for a more precise filtering mechanism.

Method: The proposed method utilizes a two-stage framework: first, semantic and cluster-based filtering guided by the EIRE module selects valuable documents. The second stage implements EIRE-guided conflict-aware filtering to ensure semantic consistency across the query, retrieved knowledge, and generated answers.

Result: The SeCon-RAG framework shows considerable improvements in generation robustness and output trustworthiness. It outperforms existing state-of-the-art defense methods in experiments across multiple LLMs and datasets.

Conclusion: SeCon-RAG is a reliable and effective solution for enhancing RAG systems by maintaining valuable knowledge and mitigating contaminations, ensuring output integrity and model trustworthiness.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems enhance large language models
(LLMs) with external knowledge but are vulnerable to corpus poisoning and
contamination attacks, which can compromise output integrity. Existing defenses
often apply aggressive filtering, leading to unnecessary loss of valuable
information and reduced reliability in generation. To address this problem, we
propose a two-stage semantic filtering and conflict-free framework for
trustworthy RAG. In the first stage, we perform a joint filter with semantic
and cluster-based filtering which is guided by the Entity-intent-relation
extractor (EIRE). EIRE extracts entities, latent objectives, and entity
relations from both the user query and filtered documents, scores their
semantic relevance, and selectively adds valuable documents into the clean
retrieval database. In the second stage, we proposed an EIRE-guided
conflict-aware filtering module, which analyzes semantic consistency between
the query, candidate answers, and retrieved knowledge before final answer
generation, filtering out internal and external contradictions that could
mislead the model. Through this two-stage process, SeCon-RAG effectively
preserves useful knowledge while mitigating conflict contamination, achieving
significant improvements in both generation robustness and output
trustworthiness. Extensive experiments across various LLMs and datasets
demonstrate that the proposed SeCon-RAG markedly outperforms state-of-the-art
defense methods.

*Wenbin Guo,Xin Wang,Jiaoyan Chen,Lingbing Guo,Zhao Li,Zirui Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReaLM is a framework designed to integrate KG embeddings with LLMs using residual vector quantization to overcome performance limitations caused by token space misalignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the gap in semantic alignment between continuous KG embeddings and the discrete token space in LLMs, which affects the efficacy and accuracy of knowledge graph completion.

Method: A novel framework, ReaLM, introduces residual vector quantization to map KG embeddings into compact code sequences. These sequences are then treated as tokens in the LLM vocabulary, ensuring better integration with semantic contexts. Additionally, ontology-based class-level constraints are employed to enhance entity prediction precision.

Result: ReaLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets, proving its capability in enhancing knowledge graph completion by aligning structured knowledge with LLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed ReaLM framework successfully bridges the structural-semantic gap between KGs and LLMs, highlighting its significance in improving reasoning and generalization in knowledge graph completion.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for
Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC), offering strong reasoning and generalization
capabilities beyond traditional embedding-based approaches. However, existing
LLM-based methods often struggle to fully exploit structured semantic
representations, as the continuous embedding space of pretrained KG models is
fundamentally misaligned with the discrete token space of LLMs. This
discrepancy hinders effective semantic transfer and limits their performance.
To address this challenge, we propose ReaLM, a novel and effective framework
that bridges the gap between KG embeddings and LLM tokenization through the
mechanism of residual vector quantization. ReaLM discretizes pretrained KG
embeddings into compact code sequences and integrates them as learnable tokens
within the LLM vocabulary, enabling seamless fusion of symbolic and contextual
knowledge. Furthermore, we incorporate ontology-guided class constraints to
enforce semantic consistency, refining entity predictions based on class-level
compatibility. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmark datasets
demonstrate that ReaLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, confirming its
effectiveness in aligning structured knowledge with large-scale language
models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates AI's ability to perform reasoning in ciphered text and its implications for evading Chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring, finding that AI models struggle significantly with this task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether AI models can effectively use ciphered reasoning to bypass CoT monitoring and assess the associated risks.

Method: The authors evaluated 28 different ciphers, testing the reasoning capability of up to 10 AI models by fine-tuning and prompting them to solve math problems as a proxy for reasoning accuracy in these ciphers.

Result: AI models generally struggle with reasoning in ciphered text, especially with less common ciphers, despite being able to translate the text into English. Model performance is linked to cipher prevalence in their pretraining data, and fine-tuning only modestly improves ciphered reasoning.

Conclusion: Evading CoT monitoring through ciphered reasoning is not currently viable for AI models. The study also emphasizes the importance of managing the development of such capabilities in future models.

Abstract: Detecting harmful AI actions is important as AI agents gain adoption.
Chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring is one method widely used to detect
adversarial attacks and AI misalignment. However, attackers and misaligned
models might evade CoT monitoring through ciphered reasoning: reasoning hidden
in encrypted, translated, or compressed text. To assess this risk, we test
whether models can perform ciphered reasoning. For each of 28 different
ciphers, we fine-tune and prompt up to 10 models to reason in that cipher. We
measure model accuracy on math problems as a proxy for reasoning ability.
Across the models we test, we find an asymmetry: model accuracy can drop
significantly when reasoning in ciphered text, even though models demonstrate
comprehension of ciphered text by being able to translate it accurately to
English. Even frontier models struggle with lesser-known ciphers, although they
can reason accurately in well-known ciphers like rot13. We show that ciphered
reasoning capability correlates with cipher prevalence in pretraining data. We
also identify scaling laws showing that ciphered reasoning capability improves
slowly with additional fine-tuning data. Our work suggests that evading CoT
monitoring using ciphered reasoning may be an ineffective tactic for current
models and offers guidance on constraining the development of this capability
in future frontier models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PAMU, a memory update mechanism that refines memories in response to changing user behaviors, enhancing long-term memory capabilities for reasoning in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current LLM long-term memory systems, particularly in failing to dynamically update memory based on user behavior and context changes.

Method: The authors propose PAMU, a mechanism combining sliding window averages and exponential moving averages to create refined, preference-aware memory representations.

Result: PAMU was tested on the LoCoMo dataset across five task scenarios and outperformed baselines by improving the output quality of LLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed PAMU technique is effective in enhancing the memory capabilities of LLMs, especially in long-term conversational contexts.

Abstract: One of the key factors influencing the reasoning capabilities of LLM-based
agents is their ability to leverage long-term memory. Integrating long-term
memory mechanisms allows agents to make informed decisions grounded in
historical interactions. While recent advances have significantly improved the
storage and retrieval components, by encoding memory into dense vectors for
similarity search or organizing memory as structured knowledge graphs most
existing approaches fall short in memory updating. In particular, they lack
mechanisms for dynamically refining preference memory representations in
response to evolving user behaviors and contexts. To address this gap, we
propose a Preference-Aware Memory Update Mechanism (PAMU) that enables dynamic
and personalized memory refinement. By integrating sliding window averages (SW)
with exponential moving averages (EMA), PAMU constructs a fused
preference-aware representation that captures both short-term fluctuations and
long-term user tendencies. We conduct experiments on five task scenarios of the
LoCoMo dataset, and the results show that our mechanism can significantly
improve the output quality of LLM in five baselines, validating its
effectiveness in long-term conversations.

Abstract: Automated resume information extraction is critical for scaling talent
acquisition, yet its real-world deployment faces three major challenges: the
extreme heterogeneity of resume layouts and content, the high cost and latency
of large language models (LLMs), and the lack of standardized datasets and
evaluation tools. In this work, we present a layout-aware and
efficiency-optimized framework for automated extraction and evaluation that
addresses all three challenges. Our system combines a fine-tuned layout parser
to normalize diverse document formats, an inference-efficient LLM extractor
based on parallel prompting and instruction tuning, and a robust two-stage
automated evaluation framework supported by new benchmark datasets. Extensive
experiments show that our framework significantly outperforms strong baselines
in both accuracy and efficiency. In particular, we demonstrate that a
fine-tuned compact 0.6B LLM achieves top-tier accuracy while significantly
reducing inference latency and computational cost. The system is fully deployed
in Alibaba's intelligent HR platform, supporting real-time applications across
its business units.

### [87] [VisRAG 2.0: Evidence-Guided Multi-Image Reasoning in Visual Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09733)
*Yubo Sun,Chunyi Peng,Yukun Yan,Shi Yu,Zhenghao Liu,Chi Chen,Zhiyuan Liu,Maosong Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces EVisRAG, a framework for improving multi-image visual reasoning in vision-language models, achieving 27% accuracy gains on visual QA benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual retrieval-augmented generation systems struggle to integrate evidence from multiple images, leading to weak reasoning and inaccurate answers.

Method: The approach, EVisRAG, employs evidence-guided multi-image reasoning and incorporates a novel training technique, RS-GRPO, to optimize both visual perception and reasoning by utilizing fine-grained rewards.

Result: EVisRAG delivers a 27% improvement in answer accuracy on average across several visual question answering benchmarks.

Conclusion: The method effectively enhances the multi-image reasoning ability of vision-language models by reliably perceiving question-relevant evidence and deriving accurate answers, similar to a detective's reasoning process.

Abstract: Visual retrieval-augmented generation (VRAG) augments vision-language models
(VLMs) with external visual knowledge to ground reasoning and reduce
hallucinations. Yet current VRAG systems often fail to reliably perceive and
integrate evidence across multiple images, leading to weak grounding and
erroneous conclusions. In this paper, we propose EVisRAG, an end-to-end
framework that learns to reason with evidence-guided multi-image to address
this issue. The model first observes retrieved images and records per-image
evidence, then derives the final answer from the aggregated evidence. To train
EVisRAG effectively, we introduce Reward-Scoped Group Relative Policy
Optimization (RS-GRPO), which binds fine-grained rewards to scope-specific
tokens to jointly optimize visual perception and reasoning abilities of VLMs.
Experimental results on multiple visual question answering benchmarks
demonstrate that EVisRAG delivers substantial end-to-end gains over backbone
VLM with 27\% improvements on average. Further analysis shows that, powered by
RS-GRPO, EVisRAG improves answer accuracy by precisely perceiving and
localizing question-relevant evidence across multiple images and deriving the
final answer from that evidence, much like a real detective.

### [88] [Judge's Verdict: A Comprehensive Analysis of LLM Judge Capability Through Human Agreement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09738)
*Steve Han,Gilberto Titericz Junior,Tom Balough,Wenfei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This research introduces the Judge's Verdict Benchmark, a two-step framework to evaluate LLMs as judges for response accuracy. Testing 54 models, it finds 27 achieving high performance, dividing them into human-like and super-consistent judges, while highlighting that training strategy, not model size, drives success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for an effective method to evaluate the ability of LLMs to replicate human judgment when scoring responses for retrieval-augmented generation tasks.

Method: A two-step evaluation approach: (1) correlation analysis to filter aligned models, and (2) analysis of human-likeness using z-scores to define judgment patterns (human-like or super-consistent).

Result: Out of 54 LLMs tested, 27 performed at Tier 1 with 23 models mimicking human judgment and 4 showing super-consistent behavior, indicating training strategy as the key differentiator rather than model size.

Conclusion: The study offers a novel evaluation benchmark for LLM judges, emphasizing that correlation is inadequate alone and introducing 'Turing Test for judges' to classify them reliably by performance tiers.

Abstract: This research introduces the Judge's Verdict Benchmark, a novel two-step
methodology to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) as judges for response
accuracy evaluation tasks. We assess how well 54 LLMs can replicate human
judgment when scoring responses from RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) or
Agentic pipelines against ground truth answers. Our methodology progresses from
traditional correlation analysis to comprehensive Cohen's Kappa analysis that
measures actual agreement patterns. The two-step approach includes: (1) a
correlation test that filters judges with strong alignment, followed by (2) a
human-likeness test using z-scores to identify two distinct judgment patterns:
human-like judgment (|z| < 1) that mimics natural human variation, and
super-consistent judgment (z > 1) that exceeds typical human-to-human agreement
levels. This methodology reveals that 27 out of 54 tested LLMs achieve Tier 1
performance: 23 models exhibit human-like patterns that preserve the nuances of
human judgment, while 4 models demonstrate super-consistent behavior, a pattern
that could indicate either enhanced reliability or oversimplification of
complex judgments. Testing 43 open-source models (1B-405B parameters) and 11
closed models (GPT, Gemini, Claude variants), we demonstrate that judge
excellence is not solely dependent on model size but on specific training
strategies. Our key contributions include: (1) establishing that correlation
alone is insufficient for judge evaluation, (2) introducing a "Turing Test for
judges" based on agreement patterns, and (3) providing a standardized benchmark
for classifying LLM judges into distinct performance tiers for different
evaluation needs.

### [89] [Gold Panning: Turning Positional Bias into Signal for Multi-Document LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09770)
*Adam Byerly,Daniel Khashabi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Gold Panning Bandits, a technique that transforms large language model (LLM) position bias into a tool for efficiently identifying relevant content, achieving improved performance with fewer computational resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to transform the position bias in large language models, typically treated as a hindrance in processing multi-document contexts, into a diagnostic tool to effectively identify the most relevant information.

Method: The method involves reordering documents to exploit position bias and framing the reordering as a bipartite matching problem. The authors propose a greedy strategy (O(N log N)) instead of the more computationally expensive Hungarian algorithm (O(N^3)), prioritizing uncertain documents in informative positions.

Result: Using the proposed method, relevant documents were identified with up to 65% fewer queries compared to random permutation baselines in knowledge-intensive NLP tasks, reducing computational costs.

Conclusion: Position biases in large language models, often considered a flaw, can be leveraged to improve efficiency and reduce inference-time computational costs without retraining the model.

Abstract: Large language models exhibit a strong position bias in multi-document
contexts, systematically prioritizing information based on location rather than
relevance. While existing approaches treat this bias as noise to be mitigated,
we introduce Gold Panning Bandits, a framework that leverages position bias as
a diagnostic signal: by reordering documents and observing shifts in the
model's responses, we can efficiently identify the most relevant content. We
frame the problem of choosing reorderings as a bipartite matching problem.
While an optimal assignment can be computed at each iteration with the
Hungarian algorithm in $O(N^3)$ time, we propose a greedy $O(N \log N)$
strategy that achieves comparable performance by prioritizing the placement of
the most uncertain documents in the most informative positions. Our approach
identifies relevant documents using up to 65\% fewer language model queries
than random permutation baselines on knowledge-intensive NLP tasks,
substantially reducing computational cost without model retraining. This work
demonstrates that inherent LLM biases can be transformed from liabilities into
assets for efficient, inference-time optimization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PromptGuard, developed to classify Bengali hate speech into six categories, outperforms traditional and random methods using few-shot learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of Bengali hate speech classification in low-resource languages where labeled datasets are scarce and expensive.

Method: Combines chi-square statistical keyword extraction with adaptive majority voting for classification using few-shot learning.

Result: Achieved a micro-F1 score of 67.61, outperforming n-gram and random baselines significantly.

Conclusion: Chi-square-based keywords and adaptive voting mechanisms proposed in PromptGuard consistently improve classification accuracy.

Abstract: The BLP-2025 Task 1A requires Bengali hate speech classification into six
categories. Traditional supervised approaches need extensive labeled datasets
that are expensive for low-resource languages. We developed PromptGuard, a
few-shot framework combining chi-square statistical analysis for keyword
extraction with adaptive majority voting for decision-making. We explore
statistical keyword selection versus random approaches and adaptive voting
mechanisms that extend classification based on consensus quality. Chi-square
keywords provide consistent improvements across categories, while adaptive
voting benefits ambiguous cases requiring extended classification rounds.
PromptGuard achieves a micro-F1 of 67.61, outperforming n-gram baselines
(60.75) and random approaches (14.65). Ablation studies confirm
chi-square-based keywords show the most consistent impact across all
categories.

*Michael Freenor,Lauren Alvarez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RISE highlights consistent rotational operations for semantic transformations in multilingual embedding spaces, suggesting a geometric structure at the sentence level.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of intuitive interpretability in modern high-dimensional language representations and exploring consistent geometric properties for cross-lingual semantic transformations.

Method: The paper introduces RISE, a geometric approach mapping semantic transformations as rotational operations in embedding spaces, evaluated across diverse models, datasets, and languages.

Result: RISE successfully maps semantic transformations like negation and conditionality consistently across languages and models, demonstrating cross-lingual geo-structural consistency.

Conclusion: The study supports the Linear Representation Hypothesis at the sentence level, marking a systematic method to understand discourse-level semantic transformations in multilingual embedding spaces.

Abstract: Understanding how language and embedding models encode semantic relationships
is fundamental to model interpretability and control. While early word
embeddings exhibited intuitive vector arithmetic (''king'' - ''man'' +
''woman'' = ''queen''), modern high-dimensional text representations lack
straightforward interpretable geometric properties. We introduce
Rotor-Invariant Shift Estimation (RISE), a geometric approach that represents
semantic transformations as consistent rotational operations in embedding
space, leveraging the manifold structure of modern language representations.
RISE operations have the ability to operate across both languages and models
with high transfer of performance, suggesting the existence of analogous
cross-lingual geometric structure. We evaluate RISE across three embedding
models, three datasets, and seven morphologically diverse languages in five
major language groups. Our results demonstrate that RISE consistently maps
discourse-level semantic transformations with distinct grammatical features
(e.g., negation and conditionality) across languages and models. This work
provides the first systematic demonstration that discourse-level semantic
transformations correspond to consistent geometric operations in multilingual
embedding spaces, empirically supporting the Linear Representation Hypothesis
at the sentence level.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address safety concerns associated with large vision language models, particularly focusing on their vulnerability to text prompt injection.

Method: An algorithm was developed for text prompt injection attacks, demonstrating its efficiency and effectiveness through comparative experiments.

Result: The proposed attack method proved to be effective and efficient, especially for large models, and required significantly lower computational resources than other approaches.

Conclusion: Text prompt injection represents a notable vulnerability in large vision language models that can be exploited with minimal computational resource demand.

Abstract: The widespread application of large vision language models has significantly
raised safety concerns. In this project, we investigate text prompt injection,
a simple yet effective method to mislead these models. We developed an
algorithm for this type of attack and demonstrated its effectiveness and
efficiency through experiments. Compared to other attack methods, our approach
is particularly effective for large models without high demand for

*Kaiwen Shi,Zheyuan Zhang,Zhengqing Yuan,Keerthiram Murugesan,Vincent Galass,Chuxu Zhang,Yanfang Ye*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces NG-Router, a framework using knowledge-graph-guided multi-agent collaboration to improve Nutritional QA, which surpasses existing single- and multi-agent methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of limited reasoning in single-agent systems and complex design in multi-agent systems in the context of nutritional QA.

Method: This paper develops NG-Router, which integrates agents into heterogeneous knowledge graphs and uses a graph neural network for routing. It employs gradient-based subgraph retrieval to enhance reasoning by identifying key evidence.

Result: NG-Router demonstrates superior performance in experiments across various benchmarks and backbone models, outperforming existing single-agent and ensemble baselines.

Conclusion: NG-Router provides a robust, knowledge-graph-guided framework for domain-specific multi-agent reasoning, marking an advance in nutrition-related QA.

Abstract: Diet plays a central role in human health, and Nutrition Question Answering
(QA) offers a promising path toward personalized dietary guidance and the
prevention of diet-related chronic diseases. However, existing methods face two
fundamental challenges: the limited reasoning capacity of single-agent systems
and the complexity of designing effective multi-agent architectures, as well as
contextual overload that hinders accurate decision-making. We introduce
Nutritional-Graph Router (NG-Router), a novel framework that formulates
nutritional QA as a supervised, knowledge-graph-guided multi-agent
collaboration problem. NG-Router integrates agent nodes into heterogeneous
knowledge graphs and employs a graph neural network to learn task-aware routing
distributions over agents, leveraging soft supervision derived from empirical
agent performance. To further address contextual overload, we propose a
gradient-based subgraph retrieval mechanism that identifies salient evidence
during training, thereby enhancing multi-hop and relational reasoning.
Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and backbone models
demonstrate that NG-Router consistently outperforms both single-agent and
ensemble baselines, offering a principled approach to domain-aware multi-agent
reasoning for complex nutritional health tasks.

TL;DR: NarraBench introduces a taxonomy for narrative-understanding tasks and surveys 78 benchmarks, finding gaps in narrative evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve evaluation methods for narrative understanding in NLP, addressing overlooked aspects and subjective components.

Method: Develop a taxonomy, analyze 78 benchmarks, identify gaps, and propose areas for improvement in narrative evaluation.

Result: Only 27% of narrative tasks are well-captured by current benchmarks; significant gaps in areas like style and perspective exist.

Conclusion: NarraBench provides a framework and insights for advancing narrative evaluation methods for NLP researchers working with LLMs.

Abstract: We present NarraBench, a theory-informed taxonomy of narrative-understanding
tasks, as well as an associated survey of 78 existing benchmarks in the area.
We find significant need for new evaluations covering aspects of narrative
understanding that are either overlooked in current work or are poorly aligned
with existing metrics. Specifically, we estimate that only 27% of narrative
tasks are well captured by existing benchmarks, and we note that some areas --
including narrative events, style, perspective, and revelation -- are nearly
absent from current evaluations. We also note the need for increased
development of benchmarks capable of assessing constitutively subjective and
perspectival aspects of narrative, that is, aspects for which there is
generally no single correct answer. Our taxonomy, survey, and methodology are
of value to NLP researchers seeking to test LLM narrative understanding.

### [95] [CoBia: Constructed Conversations Can Trigger Otherwise Concealed Societal Biases in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09871)
*Nafiseh Nikeghbal,Amir Hossein Kargaran,Jana Diesner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoBia, a method using constructed adversarial conversations to analyze biases in Large Language Models (LLMs). Findings reveal LLMs often fail to reject biased claims and follow-up questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to systematically examine how and why LLMs occasionally express harmful biases during conversations despite safety guardrails.

Method: CoBia generates adversarial scenarios where LLMs make biased claims and evaluates their recovery ability against established bias metrics and human judgments across six socio-demographic categories.

Result: Results show that LLMs amplify biases in carefully constructed conversational settings and frequently fail to reject biased follow-up questions.

Conclusion: Stress-testing with CoBia highlights intrinsic biases in LLMs, emphasizing the need for further improvements in their ethical alignment.

Abstract: Improvements in model construction, including fortified safety guardrails,
allow Large language models (LLMs) to increasingly pass standard safety checks.
However, LLMs sometimes slip into revealing harmful behavior, such as
expressing racist viewpoints, during conversations. To analyze this
systematically, we introduce CoBia, a suite of lightweight adversarial attacks
that allow us to refine the scope of conditions under which LLMs depart from
normative or ethical behavior in conversations. CoBia creates a constructed
conversation where the model utters a biased claim about a social group. We
then evaluate whether the model can recover from the fabricated bias claim and
reject biased follow-up questions. We evaluate 11 open-source as well as
proprietary LLMs for their outputs related to six socio-demographic categories
that are relevant to individual safety and fair treatment, i.e., gender, race,
religion, nationality, sex orientation, and others. Our evaluation is based on
established LLM-based bias metrics, and we compare the results against human
judgments to scope out the LLMs' reliability and alignment. The results suggest
that purposefully constructed conversations reliably reveal bias amplification
and that LLMs often fail to reject biased follow-up questions during dialogue.
This form of stress-testing highlights deeply embedded biases that can be
surfaced through interaction. Code and artifacts are available at

### [96] [iBERT: Interpretable Style Embeddings via Sense Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09882)
*Vishal Anand,Milad Alshomary,Kathleen McKeown*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: iBERT introduces interpretable and controllable embeddings for language models by modularizing stylistic and semantic information, achieving improved style representation and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance the interpretability and controllability of language model embeddings to better understand and manipulate the discriminative cues such as stylistic and semantic structures.

Method: iBERT creates sparse, non-negative mixtures over k context-independent sense vectors for each token, enabling modular and interpretable control of language representations.

Result: iBERT achieves an ~8-point improvement on the STEL benchmark for style representation compared to SBERT baselines, while maintaining competitive performance in authorship verification tasks.

Conclusion: iBERT provides a modular, interpretable method for language modeling, capable of decomposing and controlling stylistic and semantic features for enhanced analysis and generalization.

Abstract: We present iBERT (interpretable-BERT), an encoder to produce inherently
interpretable and controllable embeddings - designed to modularize and expose
the discriminative cues present in language, such as stylistic and semantic
structure. Each input token is represented as a sparse, non-negative mixture
over k context-independent sense vectors, which can be pooled into sentence
embeddings or used directly at the token level. This enables modular control
over representation, before any decoding or downstream use.
  To demonstrate our model's interpretability, we evaluate it on a suite of
style-focused tasks. On the STEL benchmark, it improves style representation
effectiveness by ~8 points over SBERT-style baselines, while maintaining
competitive performance on authorship verification. Because each embedding is a
structured composition of interpretable senses, we highlight how specific style
attributes - such as emoji use, formality, or misspelling can be assigned to
specific sense vectors. While our experiments center on style, iBERT is not
limited to stylistic modeling. Its structural modularity is designed to
interpretably decompose whichever discriminative signals are present in the
data - enabling generalization even when supervision blends stylistic and
semantic factors.

*Hossein Entezari Zarch,Lei Gao,Chaoyi Jiang,Murali Annavarm*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DELTA introduces a sparse attention mechanism that reduces computational demands in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) by intelligently selecting salient tokens while maintaining model accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Reasoning Models face high computational costs during reasoning tasks due to decoding processes that require full-context attention over long sequences.

Method: DELTA partitions transformer layers into initial full-attention layers, selection layers for identifying salient tokens, and sparse-attention layers that focus computation on the selected tokens.

Result: DELTA achieves up to a 5× reduction in attended tokens, 1.5× speedup, and matches or exceeds full attention accuracy in reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: Selective reuse of intermediate attention maps provides an effective and efficient path to improve the performance of LRMs on long-context reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve state-of-the-art performance on
challenging benchmarks by generating long chains of intermediate steps, but
their inference cost is dominated by decoding, where each new token must attend
to the entire growing sequence. Existing sparse attention methods reduce
computation by pruning the key-value (KV) cache, yet they suffer from severe
accuracy degradation on reasoning tasks due to cumulative selection errors and
the dynamic importance of tokens over long derivations. We present
\textbf{DELTA}, a training-free sparse attention mechanism that achieves
computational efficiency without sacrificing model accuracy. DELTA partitions
transformer layers into three groups: initial layers that use full attention, a
small set of \emph{selection layers} that identify salient tokens via
aggregated head-level attention scores, and subsequent \emph{sparse-attention
layers} that attend only to the selected subset. This design preserves the full
KV cache in GPU memory for accuracy, while avoiding expensive full-attention
computation over many layers. On reasoning benchmarks such as AIME and
GPQA-Diamond, DELTA matches or surpasses full attention in accuracy, while
reducing the number of attended tokens by up to $5\times$ and delivering
$1.5\times$ end-to-end speedup. Our results show that selective reuse of
intermediate attention maps offers a robust path toward efficient long-context
reasoning.

### [98] [Closing the Data-Efficiency Gap Between Autoregressive and Masked Diffusion LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09885)
*Xu Pan,Ely Hahami,Jingxuan Fan,Ziqian Xie,Haim Sompolinsky*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines the benefits of masked diffusion large language models (dLLMs) over autoregressive large language models (arLLMs) in fine-tuning and proposes a new masked fine-tuning approach to improve arLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research is motivated by the limitations of autoregressive large language models (arLLMs) in incorporating new knowledge, particularly due to issues like the 'reversal curse,' and the potential advantages of masked diffusion large language models (dLLMs).

Method: The authors fine-tuned both arLLMs and dLLMs on three datasets and assessed their performance on forward and backward QA tasks, comparing their generalization abilities and susceptibility to the reversal curse. They also proposed a masked fine-tuning paradigm for arLLMs inspired by the strengths of dLLMs.

Result: The evaluation reveals that dLLMs outperform arLLMs, achieving high QA accuracy without requiring extensive data augmentation or paraphrasing. Moreover, the new masked fine-tuning method significantly boosts the fine-tuning efficiency of arLLMs, closing the performance gap with dLLMs.

Conclusion: Masked diffusion LLMs show clear advantages in fine-tuning efficiency and avoiding the reversal curse. The proposed masked fine-tuning method for arLLMs is a promising solution to mitigate their inherent limitations and achieve results comparable to dLLMs.

Abstract: Despite autoregressive large language models (arLLMs) being the current
dominant paradigm in language modeling, they resist knowledge injection via
fine-tuning due to inherent shortcomings such as the "reversal curse" -- the
challenge of answering questions that reverse the original information order in
the training sample. Masked diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are rapidly
emerging as a powerful alternative to the arLLM paradigm, with evidence of
better data efficiency and free of the "reversal curse" in pre-training.
However, it is unknown whether these advantages extend to the post-training
phase, i.e. whether pre-trained dLLMs can easily acquire new knowledge through
fine-tuning. On three diverse datasets, we fine-tune arLLMs and dLLMs,
evaluating them with forward and backward style Question Answering (QA) to
probe knowledge generalization and the reversal curse. Our results confirm that
arLLMs critically rely on extensive data augmentation via paraphrases for QA
generalization, and paraphrases are only effective when their information order
matches the QA style. Conversely, dLLMs achieve high accuracies on both forward
and backward QAs without paraphrases; adding paraphrases yields only marginal
gains. Lastly, inspired by the dLLM's performance, we introduce a novel masked
fine-tuning paradigm for knowledge injection into pre-trained arLLMs. This
proposed method successfully and drastically improves the data efficiency of
arLLM fine-tuning, effectively closing the performance gap with dLLMs.

### [99] [Abductive Preference Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09887)
*Yijin Ni,Peng Qi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes abductive preference learning to improve language models' sensitivity to counterfactual prompts, showing significant improvements in experimental benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Currently, large language models often fail to appropriately modify responses when confronted with counterfactual prompts due to limitations in existing preference learning approaches.

Method: The authors introduce abductive preference learning, which focuses on learning preferences over prompts based on a given response, validated through experiments with an abductive dataset derived from HaluEval QA benchmark and multitask objectives.

Result: Multitask DPOP improved response selection accuracy from 90.0% to 99.5% and prompt discrimination from 54.7% to 85.0% on the abductive dataset. It also slightly increased win rate in AlpacaEval.

Conclusion: Abductive preference learning complements conventional approaches, addressing counterfactual prompt challenges and improving overall language model performance.

Abstract: Frontier large language models such as GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet remain prone
to overconfidence even after alignment through Reinforcement Learning with
Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). For instance,
they tend to offer the same conservative answer "No" to both questions "Can I
eat the [food / potato chips] that has been left out overnight?" despite the
latter requiring no refridgeration for safe consumption. We find that this
failure is potentially attributed to a limitation of existing preference
learning: it emphasizes selecting the correct response for a given prompt,
while neglecting counterfactual prompts that should alter the response.
  To address this limitation, we propose abductive preference learning, a
fine-tuning paradigm that reverses the conventional conditioning by learning
preferences over prompts given a response. To validate this idea, we construct
an abductive dataset derived from the HaluEval QA benchmark with 1,001 entries,
implementing abductive DPO and its variant DPOP. Experiments reveal
complementary strengths: standard methods improve response selection, abductive
methods improve prompt discrimination, while a multitask objective unifies
both. On the abductive dataset, multitask DPOP boosts accuracy from $90.0\%$ to
$99.5\%$ in response selection and $54.7\%$ to $85.0\%$ in prompt
discrimination, with qualitative evidence highlighting improved sensitivity to
prompt differences. Finally, evaluation on AlpacaEval shows multitask DPOP
improves win rate (from $5.26\%$ to $6.17\%$), confirming that abductive
preference learning preserves the benefits of conventional preference
optimization while addressing the overlooked challenge of counterfactual
prompts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces HIPPD, a brain-inspired framework for personality detection from text, which combines a large language model, a dynamic memory module, and specialized lightweight models for improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for personality detection from text struggle to capture contextual information across multiple posts and fail to extract robust features in sparse settings, inspiring the creation of a new approach.

Method: HIPPD integrates a large language model for global semantic reasoning, a dynamic memory module based on prefrontal cortex mechanisms for adaptive feature selection, and lightweight specialized models for pattern recognition, all orchestrated with a winner-takes-all mechanism.

Result: Experiments on the Kaggle and Pandora datasets show that HIPPD surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in personality detection accuracy.

Conclusion: The brain-inspired hierarchical design of HIPPD effectively addresses limitations in existing methods and offers a superior solution for personality detection from text.

Abstract: Personality detection from text aims to infer an individual's personality
traits based on linguistic patterns. However, existing machine learning
approaches often struggle to capture contextual information spanning multiple
posts and tend to fall short in extracting representative and robust features
in semantically sparse environments. This paper presents HIPPD, a
brain-inspired framework for personality detection that emulates the
hierarchical information processing of the human brain. HIPPD utilises a large
language model to simulate the cerebral cortex, enabling global semantic
reasoning and deep feature abstraction. A dynamic memory module, modelled after
the prefrontal cortex, performs adaptive gating and selective retention of
critical features, with all adjustments driven by dopaminergic prediction error
feedback. Subsequently, a set of specialised lightweight models, emulating the
basal ganglia, are dynamically routed via a strict winner-takes-all mechanism
to capture the personality-related patterns they are most proficient at
recognising. Extensive experiments on the Kaggle and Pandora datasets
demonstrate that HIPPD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

*Shangbin Feng,Wenhao Yu,Yike Wang,Hongming Zhang,Yulia Tsvetkov,Dong Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Switch Generation, a method allowing collaboration between pre-trained and aligned language models to enhance performance across diverse tasks, achieving significant improvements by dynamically utilizing their complementary strengths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the trade-offs in alignment training where language models excel at reasoning and instruction but lag in creativity and calibration compared to unaligned models. The authors aim to combine the strengths of different models without compromising on specific skill sets.

Method: The method involves training a switcher language model that learns when to delegate segments of responses to pre-trained or aligned language models. This dynamic allocation leverages the strengths of each model type during the inference process.

Result: Experiments across 18 datasets demonstrate the approach consistently outperforms individual models on 16 tasks and exceeds baseline methods by 12.9% on average. It also shows that Switch Generation effectively generalizes to unseen models and tasks.

Conclusion: Switch Generation is a promising approach for improving language model flexibility and performance by enabling collaboration between models, utilizing previously discarded outputs, and addressing their respective weaknesses.

Abstract: Alignment training has tradeoffs: it helps language models (LMs) gain in
reasoning and instruction following but might lose out on skills such as
creativity and calibration, where unaligned base models are better at. We aim
to make the best of both worlds through model collaboration, where different
models in the training pipeline collaborate and complement each other. Since LM
responses feature interleaving skills that favor different models, we propose
Switch Generation, where pretrained and aligned model versions take turns to
``speak'' in a response sequence. Specifically, we train a switcher LM by
learning from outcomes of choosing different models to generate the next
segment across diverse queries and contexts. At inference time, the switcher LM
guides different model checkpoints to dynamically generate the next segment
where their strengths are most needed. Extensive experiments with 8 model
collaboration baselines and 18 datasets show that 1) model collaboration
consistently outperforms individual models on 16 out of 18 tasks, and 2) Switch
Generation further outperforms baselines by 12.9% on average. Further analysis
reveals that Switch Generation discovers compositional skills to solve problems
where individual models struggle and generalizes to unseen models and tasks,
reusing and repurposing by-products in expensive model training pipelines that
are otherwise discarded.

### [102] [Enhancing Faithfulness in Abstractive Summarization via Span-Level Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09915)
*Sicong Huang,Qianqi Yan,Shengze Wang,Ian Lane*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) are enhanced for faithfulness in abstractive summarization using a fine-tuning approach based on annotated hallucinations at the span-level, outperforming existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs, though capable of fluent summaries, frequently produce unfaithful content, which limits their reliability and requires strategies to mitigate hallucinations and diverse errors.

Method: The authors utilize GPT-4-based span-level annotations of hallucinations and fine-tune LLMs using three techniques: gradient ascent, unlikelihood training, and task vector negation.

Result: The experimental findings show that leveraging hallucination annotations enhances summarization faithfulness significantly, with unlikelihood training being the most effective among the techniques tested.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning LLMs with span-level hallucination annotations successfully improves faithfulness in summarization, making the models more reliable for accurate content generation.

Abstract: Abstractive summarization using large language models (LLMs) has become an
essential tool for condensing information. However, despite their ability to
generate fluent summaries, these models sometimes produce unfaithful summaries,
introducing hallucinations at the word, phrase, or concept level. Existing
mitigation strategies, such as post-processing corrections or contrastive
learning with synthetically generated negative samples, fail to fully address
the diverse errors that can occur in LLM-generated summaries. In this paper, we
investigate fine-tuning strategies to reduce the occurrence of unfaithful spans
in generated summaries. First, we automatically generate summaries for the set
of source documents in the training set with a variety of LLMs and then use
GPT-4o to annotate any hallucinations it detects at the span-level. Leveraging
these annotations, we fine-tune LLMs with both hallucination-free summaries and
annotated unfaithful spans to enhance model faithfulness. In this paper, we
introduce a new dataset that contains both faithful and unfaithful summaries
with span-level labels and we evaluate three techniques to fine-tuning a LLM to
improve the faithfulness of the resulting summarization: gradient ascent,
unlikelihood training, and task vector negation. Experimental results show that
all three approaches successfully leverage span-level annotations to improve
faithfulness, with unlikelihood training being the most effective.

### [103] [Unpacking Hateful Memes: Presupposed Context and False Claims](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09935)
*Weibin Cai,Jiayu Li,Reza Zafarani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces SHIELD, a framework for hateful meme detection focusing on presupposed context and false claims using PCM and FACT modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the harm caused by hateful memes, this study investigates their defining features: presupposed context and false claims.

Method: The authors create the PCM module for modeling context across modalities and the FACT module for detecting false claims using external knowledge and reference graphs, which are combined into the SHIELD framework.

Result: SHIELD surpasses state-of-the-art methods in hateful meme detection and performs well in related tasks like fake news detection.

Conclusion: SHIELD effectively captures the essence of hateful memes, improving detection accuracy and demonstrating versatility across domains.

Abstract: While memes are often humorous, they are frequently used to disseminate hate,
causing serious harm to individuals and society. Current approaches to hateful
meme detection mainly rely on pre-trained language models. However, less focus
has been dedicated to \textit{what make a meme hateful}. Drawing on insights
from philosophy and psychology, we argue that hateful memes are characterized
by two essential features: a \textbf{presupposed context} and the expression of
\textbf{false claims}. To capture presupposed context, we develop \textbf{PCM}
for modeling contextual information across modalities. To detect false claims,
we introduce the \textbf{FACT} module, which integrates external knowledge and
harnesses cross-modal reference graphs. By combining PCM and FACT, we introduce
\textbf{\textsf{SHIELD}}, a hateful meme detection framework designed to
capture the fundamental nature of hate. Extensive experiments show that SHIELD
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across datasets and metrics, while
demonstrating versatility on other tasks, such as fake news detection.

### [104] [Beyond Fertility: Analyzing STRR as a Metric for Multilingual Tokenization Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09947)
*Mir Tafseer Nayeem,Sawsan Alqahtani,Md Tahmid Rahman Laskar,Tasnim Mohiuddin,M Saiful Bari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper reveals limitations of the standard tokenization metric (fertility) in large language models (LLMs), proposing a new metric, Single Token Retention Rate (STRR), for better cross-lingual fairness evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tokenization is crucial for LLMs but inadequately analyzed, especially in terms of cross-lingual fairness and domain sensitivity. Current metrics (e.g., fertility) fail to reveal systematic bias across languages and domains.

Method: The study analyzes six widely-used tokenizers across seven languages and two domains, introduces STRR to evaluate how effectively words are preserved as single tokens, and compares this metric to traditional fertility.

Result: STRR highlights biases where English and Chinese are favored differently than Hindi, offering a new interpretable framework to view token allocation and fairness in LLM tokenizers.

Conclusion: STRR complements the fertility metric by exposing practical and fairness-focused insights. Its adoption can guide the design of more equitable multilingual tokenizers.

Abstract: Tokenization is a crucial but under-evaluated step in large language models
(LLMs). The standard metric, fertility (the average number of tokens per word),
captures compression efficiency but obscures how vocabularies are allocated
across languages and domains. We analyze six widely used tokenizers across
seven languages and two domains, finding stable fertility for English, high
fertility for Chinese, and little domain sensitivity. To address fertility's
blind spots, we propose the Single Token Retention Rate (STRR), which measures
the proportion of words preserved as single tokens. STRR reveals systematic
prioritization of English, strong support for Chinese, and fragmentation in
Hindi, offering an interpretable view of cross-lingual fairness. Our results
show that STRR complements fertility and provides practical guidance for
designing more equitable multilingual tokenizers.

*Jiaqi Wei,Xiang Zhang,Yuejin Yang,Wenxuan Huang,Juntai Cao,Sheng Xu,Xiang Zhuang,Zhangyang Gao,Muhammad Abdul-Mageed,Laks V. S. Lakshmanan,Chenyu You,Wanli Ouyang,Siqi Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the fragmented state of deliberative tree search in large language models by presenting a unified framework to differentiate between transient search guidance and durable reward modeling for self-improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve ambiguities in the role of the reward signal in deliberative tree searches and establish a formalized structure to unify research efforts in this field.

Method: Introduces a formal framework consisting of three components: Search Mechanism, Reward Formulation, and Transition Function, and provides a taxonomy to synthesize existing research.

Result: Establishes a clear formal distinction between transient search guidance for test-time scaling and durable reward modeling for self-improvement, offering a framework to systematize future research.

Conclusion: This formalism and taxonomy enable more structured progress in developing autonomous, self-improving agents, steering future research in large language models towards algorithmic efficiency and self-enhancement.

Abstract: Deliberative tree search is a cornerstone of modern Large Language Model
(LLM) research, driving the pivot from brute-force scaling toward algorithmic
efficiency. This single paradigm unifies two critical frontiers:
\textbf{Test-Time Scaling (TTS)}, which deploys on-demand computation to solve
hard problems, and \textbf{Self-Improvement}, which uses search-generated data
to durably enhance model parameters. However, this burgeoning field is
fragmented and lacks a common formalism, particularly concerning the ambiguous
role of the reward signal -- is it a transient heuristic or a durable learning
target? This paper resolves this ambiguity by introducing a unified framework
that deconstructs search algorithms into three core components: the
\emph{Search Mechanism}, \emph{Reward Formulation}, and \emph{Transition
Function}. We establish a formal distinction between transient \textbf{Search
Guidance} for TTS and durable \textbf{Parametric Reward Modeling} for
Self-Improvement. Building on this formalism, we introduce a component-centric
taxonomy, synthesize the state-of-the-art, and chart a research roadmap toward
more systematic progress in creating autonomous, self-improving agents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Examines how bilingual and non-bilingual users perceive and rely on imperfect Machine Translation (MT) during casual use, based on a study conducted in a public museum.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand public perceptions and reliance on imperfect MT in real-world scenarios and inform the contextualization of MT research.

Method: A human study involving 452 participants in a public museum, analyzing how different error types in MT (fluency and adequacy errors) affect bilingual and non-bilingual users' reliance.

Result: Non-bilingual users tend to over-rely on MT due to a lack of alternative evaluation strategies, experiencing issues when encountering errors which may alter their future usage habits.

Conclusion: Emphasizes the importance of enhancing MT quality as well as fostering MT literacy among users through better evaluation techniques and explanation methods.

Abstract: As Machine Translation (MT) becomes increasingly commonplace, understanding
how the general public perceives and relies on imperfect MT is crucial for
contextualizing MT research in real-world applications. We present a human
study conducted in a public museum (n=452), investigating how fluency and
adequacy errors impact bilingual and non-bilingual users' reliance on MT during
casual use. Our findings reveal that non-bilingual users often over-rely on MT
due to a lack of evaluation strategies and alternatives, while experiencing the
impact of errors can prompt users to reassess future reliance. This highlights
the need for MT evaluation and NLP explanation techniques to promote not only
MT quality, but also MT literacy among its users.

### [107] [MTP-S2UT: Enhancing Speech-to-Speech Translation Quality with Multi-token Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10003)
*Jianjin Wang,Runsong Zhao,Xiaoqian Liu,Yuan Ge,Ziqiang Xu,Tong Xiao,Shengxiang Gao,Zhengtao Yu,Jingbo Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a multi-token prediction (MTP) loss for speech-to-unit translation (S2UT) models to improve translation quality by enhancing semantic density earlier in the model's layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current direct speech-to-speech translation methods rely on speech tokens, which lack rich semantic density, requiring multiple tokens for complete semantics.

Method: The authors propose an MTP-S2UT loss that applies multi-token prediction loss to intermediate hidden representations where CTC loss is computed.

Result: Experiments show that MTP loss variants improve S2UT translation quality, with the MTP-S2UT implementation delivering the best results.

Conclusion: Applying MTP loss to intermediate layers enhances hidden representation earlier, leading to improved semantic capture and translation quality than traditional approaches.

Abstract: Current direct speech-to-speech translation methods predominantly employ
speech tokens as intermediate representations. However, a single speech token
is not dense in semantics, so we generally need multiple tokens to express a
complete semantic unit. To address this limitation, we introduce multi-token
prediction (MTP) loss into speech-to-unit translation (S2UT) models, enabling
models to predict multiple subsequent tokens at each position, thereby
capturing more complete semantics and enhancing information density per
position. Initial MTP implementations apply the loss at the final layer, which
improves output representation but initiates information enrichment too late.
We hypothesize that advancing the information enrichment process to
intermediate layers can achieve earlier and more effective enhancement of
hidden representation. Consequently, we propose MTP-S2UT loss, applying MTP
loss to hidden representation where CTC loss is computed. Experiments
demonstrate that all MTP loss variants consistently improve the quality of S2UT
translation, with MTP-S2UT achieving the best performance.

*Shu Zhao,Tan Yu,Anbang Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ExpandSearch, a method for improving multi-hop QA by training an LLM-based search agent with query expansion through reinforcement learning, incorporating a pre-trained squeezer model to enhance retrieved document understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of reasoning-augmented search agents on multi-hop QA benchmarks by enhancing their query expansion and document understanding capabilities.

Method: The approach trains a search agent via reinforcement learning to propose multiple query variants for simultaneous search, integrating a pre-trained squeezer model to improve understanding of retrieved documents while managing tasks efficiently.

Result: The proposed ExpandSearch method achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an average accuracy improvement of 4.4% across seven multi-hop QA benchmarks.

Conclusion: ExpandSearch shows that even smaller-scale models (e.g., 3B LLMs), supported by strategic query expansion and a helper model, can provide strong results in diverse and complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Reasoning-augmented search agents, such as Search-R1, are trained to reason,
search, and generate the final answer iteratively. Nevertheless, due to their
limited capabilities in reasoning and search, their performance on multi-hop QA
benchmarks remains far from satisfactory. To handle complex or compound
queries, we train an LLM-based search agent with the native capability of query
expansion through reinforcement learning. In each turn, our search agent
proposes several query variants, which are searched simultaneously to cover
more relevant information. Meanwhile, given limited post-training data and
computing resources, it is very challenging for a search agent to master
multiple tasks, including query generation, retrieved information
understanding, and answer generation. Therefore, we propose incorporating a
pre-trained squeezer model that helps the search agent understand the retrieved
documents, allowing the search agent to focus on query generation for high
retrieval recall. With the assistance of the squeezer model, we discover that
even a small-scale 3B LLM can demonstrate a strong capability of query
expansion and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on the multi-hop QA benchmarks.
To be specific, our experiments across seven question-answering benchmarks
demonstrate that our method, named ExpandSearch, achieves an average
improvement of 4.4% compared to state-of-the-art baselines, with strong gains
on multi-hop reasoning tasks requiring diverse evidence aggregation.

### [109] [Path Drift in Large Reasoning Models:How First-Person Commitments Override Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10013)
*Yuyi Huang,Runzhe Zhan,Lidia S. Chao,Ailin Tao,Derek F. Wong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Long Chain-of-Thought (Long-CoT) prompts in large language models (LLMs) face vulnerabilities leading to unsafe reasoning paths, termed Path Drift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the underexplored issue of alignment drift during complex reasoning tasks performed by LLMs, which can lead to unsafe or undesirable outputs.

Method: The authors conduct empirical analysis to identify behavioral triggers and introduce a Path Drift Induction Framework which manipulates reasoning trajectories. They also propose path-level defense strategies such as role attribution correction and reflective safety cues.

Result: The study reveals three behavioral triggers of Path Drift and shows that their framework can independently and collectively lower refusal rates, emphasizing vulnerabilities in Long-CoT prompting.

Conclusion: Long-CoT models require trajectory-level oversight to ensure safety and alignment during structured reasoning tasks.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for complex
reasoning tasks, Long Chain-of-Thought (Long-CoT) prompting has emerged as a
key paradigm for structured inference. Despite early-stage safeguards enabled
by alignment techniques such as RLHF, we identify a previously underexplored
vulnerability: reasoning trajectories in Long-CoT models can drift from aligned
paths, resulting in content that violates safety constraints. We term this
phenomenon Path Drift. Through empirical analysis, we uncover three behavioral
triggers of Path Drift: (1) first-person commitments that induce goal-driven
reasoning that delays refusal signals; (2) ethical evaporation, where
surface-level disclaimers bypass alignment checkpoints; (3) condition chain
escalation, where layered cues progressively steer models toward unsafe
completions. Building on these insights, we introduce a three-stage Path Drift
Induction Framework comprising cognitive load amplification, self-role priming,
and condition chain hijacking. Each stage independently reduces refusal rates,
while their combination further compounds the effect. To mitigate these risks,
we propose a path-level defense strategy incorporating role attribution
correction and metacognitive reflection (reflective safety cues). Our findings
highlight the need for trajectory-level alignment oversight in long-form
reasoning beyond token-level alignment.

### [110] [Lightweight Baselines for Medical Abstract Classification: DistilBERT with Cross-Entropy as a Strong Default](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10025)
*Jiaqi Liu,Lanruo Wang,Su Liu,Xin Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores using compact encoders like DistilBERT for medical abstract classification under strict cost and efficiency constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying large language models in healthcare is challenged by constraints like cost, latency, and privacy, prompting the need for more lightweight solutions.

Method: The authors finetune compact models (BERT base and DistilBERT) using three objectives—standard cross-entropy, class-weighted cross-entropy, and focal loss—while keeping other experimental settings fixed.

Result: DistilBERT with plain cross-entropy offers the best accuracy and efficiency balance while using fewer parameters compared to BERT base.

Conclusion: Opting for compact encoders and simple loss functions like cross-entropy is a strong starting point for medical NLP tasks within constrained environments.

Abstract: Large language models work well for many NLP tasks, but they are hard to
deploy in health settings with strict cost, latency, and privacy limits. We
revisit a lightweight recipe for medical abstract classification and ask how
far compact encoders can go under a controlled budget. Using the public medical
abstracts corpus, we finetune BERT base and DistilBERT with three objectives
standard cross-entropy, class weighted cross entropy, and focal loss keeping
tokenizer, sequence length, optimizer, and schedule fixed. DistilBERT with
plain cross-entropy gives the best balance on the test set while using far
fewer parameters than BERT base. We report accuracy, Macro F1, and Weighted F1,
release the evaluation code, and include confusion analyses to make error
patterns clear. Our results suggest a practical default: start with a compact
encoder and cross-entropy, then add calibration and task-specific checks before
moving to heavier models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces HUME, a human evaluation framework for text embeddings, comparing human and embedding model performance across 16 datasets to improve interpretability and benchmark development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of reliable human performance estimates in embedding model evaluations and understand where models succeed or fail.

Method: Human performance was measured across 16 datasets covering reranking, classification, clustering, and semantic similarity, providing a comparative analysis with model performance.

Result: Humans achieved an average performance of 77.6% while the best model achieved 80.1%, highlighting model strengths and shortcomings in specific tasks and languages.

Conclusion: HUME provides human performance baselines, insights into task difficulty, and supports better interpretation and development of models and benchmarks, with resources made publicly available.

Abstract: Comparing human and model performance offers a valuable perspective for
understanding the strengths and limitations of embedding models, highlighting
where they succeed and where they fail to capture meaning and nuance. However,
such comparisons are rarely made, as human performance on embedding tasks is
difficult to measure. To fill this gap, we introduce HUME: Human Evaluation
Framework for Text Embeddings. While frameworks like MTEB provide broad model
evaluation, they lack reliable estimates of human performance, limiting the
interpretability of model scores. We measure human performance across 16 MTEB
datasets spanning reranking, classification, clustering, and semantic textual
similarity across linguistically diverse high- and low-resource languages.
Humans achieve an average performance of 77.6% compared to 80.1% for the best
embedding model, although variation is substantial: models reach near-ceiling
performance on some datasets while struggling on others, suggesting dataset
issues and revealing shortcomings in low-resource languages. We provide human
performance baselines, insight into task difficulty patterns, and an extensible
evaluation framework that enables a more meaningful interpretation of the model
and informs the development of both models and benchmarks. Our code, dataset,

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLMN is a new framework combining neural and symbolic reasoning to improve interpretability and accuracy in NLP, particularly in concept-aware tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenges of interpretability in deep learning-based NLP, especially in critical fields like healthcare and finance, inspired this research.

Method: The paper introduces CLMN, which uses continuous embeddings for concepts, applies fuzzy-logic reasoning for adaptive rules, and integrates concept-aware representations to enhance decision-making.

Result: CLMN achieves better accuracy and explanation quality compared to existing concept-based methods across multiple datasets and pre-trained models.

Conclusion: Neural-symbolic fusion in a unified concept space can yield transparent and high-performing NLP systems.

Abstract: Deep learning has advanced NLP, but interpretability remains limited,
especially in healthcare and finance. Concept bottleneck models tie predictions
to human concepts in vision, but NLP versions either use binary activations
that harm text representations or latent concepts that weaken semantics, and
they rarely model dynamic concept interactions such as negation and context. We
introduce the Concept Language Model Network (CLMN), a neural-symbolic
framework that keeps both performance and interpretability. CLMN represents
concepts as continuous, human-readable embeddings and applies fuzzy-logic
reasoning to learn adaptive interaction rules that state how concepts affect
each other and the final decision. The model augments original text features
with concept-aware representations and automatically induces interpretable
logic rules. Across multiple datasets and pre-trained language models, CLMN
achieves higher accuracy than existing concept-based methods while improving
explanation quality. These results show that integrating neural representations
with symbolic reasoning in a unified concept space can yield practical,
transparent NLP systems.

TL;DR: The paper presents Unilaw-R1, a compact and effective large language model tailored to legal reasoning, addressing key issues in the legal domain with a high-quality dataset and innovative training strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Legal problem-solving remains underexplored for large language models, necessitating a focused approach to overcome challenges in legal knowledge, reasoning, and generalization.

Method: Developed a 7-billion parameter LLM (Unilaw-R1) using a high-quality dataset (Unilaw-R1-Data) and a two-stage training strategy: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). An evaluation benchmark (Unilaw-R1-Eval) was also created to measure legal reasoning abilities.

Result: Unilaw-R1 outperforms models of similar scale and matches performance with much larger models. It achieved superior results on benchmarks like LawBench and LexEval, outperforming competitors by significant margins.

Conclusion: Unilaw-R1 demonstrates that smaller, optimally trained models can achieve state-of-the-art results in domain-specific tasks like legal reasoning, offering cost-effective and interpretable solutions for legal AI applications.

Abstract: Reasoning-focused large language models (LLMs) are rapidly evolving across
various domains, yet their capabilities in handling complex legal problems
remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce Unilaw-R1, a large language
model tailored for legal reasoning. With a lightweight 7-billion parameter
scale, Unilaw-R1 significantly reduces deployment cost while effectively
tackling three core challenges in the legal domain: insufficient legal
knowledge, unreliable reasoning logic, and weak business generalization. To
address these issues, we first construct Unilaw-R1-Data, a high-quality dataset
containing 17K distilled and screened chain-of-thought (CoT) samples. Based on
this, we adopt a two-stage training strategy combining Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL), which significantly boosts the
performance on complex legal reasoning tasks and supports interpretable
decision-making in legal AI applications. To assess legal reasoning ability, we
also introduce Unilaw-R1-Eval, a dedicated benchmark designed to evaluate
models across single- and multi-choice legal tasks. Unilaw-R1 demonstrates
strong results on authoritative benchmarks, outperforming all models of similar
scale and achieving performance on par with the much larger
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B (54.9%). Following domain-specific training, it
also showed significant gains on LawBench and LexEval, exceeding
Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct (46.6%) by an average margin of 6.6%.

*Wenqing Wang,Muhammad Asif Ali,Ali Shoker,Ruohan Yang,Junyang Chen,Ying Sha,Huan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces A-IPO, a method that infers user intent to better align model responses with diverse preferences, outperforming existing methods on several benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current preference optimization methods, which prioritize majority views and overlook minority opinions and latent user intentions.

Method: The authors propose an Adaptive Intent-driven Preference Optimization (A-IPO) method, which introduces an intention module to infer user intent and incorporate it into a new reward function. This approach encourages better alignment between model responses and user intentions.

Result: The paper demonstrates that A-IPO significantly improves preference alignment on new benchmarks like Real-pref and Attack-pref, and an extended dataset, showcasing superior results in metrics like Response-Intention Consistency and Adversarial Defense success rates compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: A-IPO effectively models diverse user intents, optimizing pluralistic preferences while improving robustness against adversarial inputs, making it a substantial improvement over baseline methods in preference alignment.

Abstract: Human preferences are diverse and dynamic, shaped by regional, cultural, and
social factors. Existing alignment methods like Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) and its variants often default to majority views, overlooking minority
opinions and failing to capture latent user intentions in prompts.
  To address these limitations, we introduce \underline{\textbf{A}}daptive
\textbf{\underline{I}}ntent-driven \textbf{\underline{P}}reference
\textbf{\underline{O}}ptimization (\textbf{A-IPO}). Specifically,A-IPO
introduces an intention module that infers the latent intent behind each user
prompt and explicitly incorporates this inferred intent into the reward
function, encouraging stronger alignment between the preferred model's
responses and the user's underlying intentions. We demonstrate, both
theoretically and empirically, that incorporating an intention--response
similarity term increases the preference margin (by a positive shift of
$\lambda\,\Delta\mathrm{sim}$ in the log-odds), resulting in clearer separation
between preferred and dispreferred responses compared to DPO.
  For evaluation, we introduce two new benchmarks, Real-pref, Attack-pref along
with an extended version of an existing dataset, GlobalOpinionQA-Ext, to assess
real-world and adversarial preference alignment.
  Through explicit modeling of diverse user intents,A-IPO facilitates
pluralistic preference optimization while simultaneously enhancing adversarial
robustness in preference alignment. Comprehensive empirical evaluation
demonstrates that A-IPO consistently surpasses existing baselines, yielding
substantial improvements across key metrics: up to +24.8 win-rate and +45.6
Response-Intention Consistency on Real-pref; up to +38.6 Response Similarity
and +52.2 Defense Success Rate on Attack-pref; and up to +54.6 Intention
Consistency Score on GlobalOpinionQA-Ext.

*Parthiv Chatterjee,Shivam Sonawane,Amey Hengle,Aditya Tanna,Sourish Dasgupta,Tanmoy Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of personalized summarization, introducing a data augmentation method called PerAugy to boost performance by enhancing dataset diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personalized summarization remains challenging due to the scarcity of training data containing both user preferences and target summaries, and limited topic diversity in existing datasets.

Method: The proposed PerAugy technique involves cross-trajectory shuffling and summary-content perturbation to augment dataset diversity and enhance user-encoder accuracy.

Result: PerAugy significantly improves the accuracy of state-of-the-art user-encoders (best AUC +0.132) and enhances personalization in summarization frameworks (avg. 61.2% boost in PSE-SU4 metric).

Conclusion: Increased diversity in augmented datasets, as quantified by metrics like TP and DegreeD, strongly correlates with better user-encoder performance, demonstrating the importance of diversity in driving gains in personalized summarization.

Abstract: Document summarization enables efficient extraction of user-relevant content
but is inherently shaped by individual subjectivity, making it challenging to
identify subjective salient information in multifaceted documents. This
complexity underscores the necessity for personalized summarization. However,
training models for personalized summarization has so far been challenging,
particularly because diverse training data containing both user preference
history (i.e., click-skip trajectory) and expected (gold-reference) summaries
are scarce. The MS/CAS PENS dataset is a valuable resource but includes only
preference history without target summaries, preventing end-to-end supervised
learning, and its limited topic-transition diversity further restricts
generalization. To address this, we propose $\mathrm{PerAugy}$, a novel
cross-trajectory shuffling and summary-content perturbation based data
augmentation technique that significantly boosts the accuracy of four
state-of-the-art baseline (SOTA) user-encoders commonly used in personalized
summarization frameworks (best result: $\text{0.132}$$\uparrow$ w.r.t AUC). We
select two such SOTA summarizer frameworks as baselines and observe that when
augmented with their corresponding improved user-encoders, they consistently
show an increase in personalization (avg. boost: $\text{61.2\%}\uparrow$ w.r.t.
PSE-SU4 metric). As a post-hoc analysis of the role of induced diversity in the
augmented dataset by \peraugy, we introduce three dataset diversity metrics --
$\mathrm{TP}$, $\mathrm{RTC}$, and \degreed\ to quantify the induced diversity.
We find that $\mathrm{TP}$ and $\mathrm{DegreeD}$ strongly correlate with
user-encoder performance on the PerAugy-generated dataset across all accuracy
metrics, indicating that increased dataset diversity is a key factor driving

### [116] [Stop When Enough: Adaptive Early-Stopping for Chain-of-Thought Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10103)
*Renliang Sun,Wei Cheng,Dawei Li,Haifeng Chen,Wei Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: REFRAIN introduces a framework to address overthinking in large language models (LLMs) by adaptively determining optimal stopping points during reasoning, reducing token usage while maintaining or improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Excessive or redundant reasoning in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) processes by LLMs can lead to higher inference costs and incorrect conclusions. There is a need for a method to manage overthinking effectively.

Method: The REFRAIN framework employs a two-stage stop discriminator to identify redundant reasoning and a sliding-window Upper Confidence Bound (SW-UCB) multi-armed bandit controller to adjust reasoning thresholds dynamically, without requiring supervision or fine-tuning.

Result: REFRAIN demonstrated a 20-55% reduction in token usage across various benchmarks and model families while maintaining or improving reasoning accuracy. Extensive robustness and ablation experiments confirmed its stability.

Conclusion: The study introduces 'when-to-stop' as a scalable axis for reasoning management, helping LLMs achieve sufficient reasoning levels without excessive inference costs or errors.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has driven recent gains of large language
models (LLMs) on reasoning-intensive tasks by externalizing intermediate steps.
However, excessive or redundant reasoning -- so-called overthinking -- can
increase inference costs and lead LLMs toward incorrect conclusions. In this
paper, we present REFRAIN ($\underline{REF}$lective-$\underline{R}$edundancy
for $\underline{A}$daptive $\underline{IN}$ference), a training-free framework
that adaptively determines when to stop reasoning to mitigate overthinking.
REFRAIN integrates a two-stage stop discriminator to identify reflective yet
redundant reasoning and a sliding-window Upper Confidence Bound (SW-UCB)
multi-armed bandit controller to dynamically adjust stopping thresholds
according to problem difficulty without supervision or fine-tuning. Across four
representative benchmarks and two model families, REFRAIN reduces token usage
by 20-55% while maintaining or improving accuracy compared to standard CoT
prompting. Extensive ablation and robustness analyses demonstrate its stability
across models, scorers, and prompt variations. In summary, our findings
highlight when-to-stop as a new and practical axis of test-time scaling --
enabling models to reason not just more, but just enough.

*Luyao Zhuang,Shengyuan Chen,Yilin Xiao,Huachi Zhou,Yujing Zhang,Hao Chen,Qinggang Zhang,Xiao Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LinearRAG proposes a novel framework for retrieval-augmented generation, addressing challenges in traditional methods by introducing a relation-free hierarchical graph for better performance and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RAG systems face difficulties when handling unstructured, large-scale corpora, particularly in mitigating hallucinations and retrieving information for complex queries. Current graph-based approaches often rely on costly and unstable relation extraction, which degrades retrieval quality.

Method: The proposed LinearRAG framework constructs a Tri-Graph using lightweight entity extraction and semantic linking, avoiding relation modeling. It employs a two-stage retrieval strategy: local semantic bridging for entity activation and global importance aggregation for passage retrieval.

Result: Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that LinearRAG significantly outperforms existing baseline models in terms of retrieval and generation quality.

Conclusion: LinearRAG provides a scalable, efficient, and reliable approach for retrieval-augmented generation, improving performance and reducing computational costs compared to conventional graph-based methods.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is widely used to mitigate
hallucinations of Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging external
knowledge. While effective for simple queries, traditional RAG systems struggle
with large-scale, unstructured corpora where information is fragmented. Recent
advances incorporate knowledge graphs to capture relational structures,
enabling more comprehensive retrieval for complex, multi-hop reasoning tasks.
However, existing graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) methods rely on unstable and
costly relation extraction for graph construction, often producing noisy graphs
with incorrect or inconsistent relations that degrade retrieval quality. In
this paper, we revisit the pipeline of existing GraphRAG systems and propose
LinearRAG (Linear Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation), an efficient
framework that enables reliable graph construction and precise passage
retrieval. Specifically, LinearRAG constructs a relation-free hierarchical
graph, termed Tri-Graph, using only lightweight entity extraction and semantic
linking, avoiding unstable relation modeling. This new paradigm of graph
construction scales linearly with corpus size and incurs no extra token
consumption, providing an economical and reliable indexing of the original
passages. For retrieval, LinearRAG adopts a two-stage strategy: (i) relevant
entity activation via local semantic bridging, followed by (ii) passage
retrieval through global importance aggregation. Extensive experiments on four
datasets demonstrate that LinearRAG significantly outperforms baseline models.

*Zilong Wang,Xiaoyu Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework combining OCR and Large Language Models to improve accuracy and efficiency in extracting information from copy-heavy documents, achieving high accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of accurate and efficient information extraction from copy-heavy enterprise documents, which has been critically understudied.

Method: The framework strategically integrates OCR engines with Large Language Models, implements intelligent strategy selection based on document characteristics, and evaluates this through 25 configurations in various extraction paradigms.

Result: The framework achieved remarkable results, such as F1=1.0 with 0.97s latency for structured documents, and F1=0.997 accuracy with 0.6s latency for image inputs, while improving performance 54 times compared to naive methods.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that copy-heavy tasks can be transformed into opportunities for optimization through structure-aware strategy selection, establishing a scalable system for enterprise document streams.

Abstract: Information extraction from copy-heavy documents, characterized by massive
volumes of structurally similar content, represents a critical yet understudied
challenge in enterprise document processing. We present a systematic framework
that strategically combines OCR engines with Large Language Models (LLMs) to
optimize the accuracy-efficiency trade-off inherent in repetitive document
extraction tasks. Unlike existing approaches that pursue universal solutions,
our method exploits document-specific characteristics through intelligent
strategy selection. We implement and evaluate 25 configurations across three
extraction paradigms (direct, replacement, and table-based) on identity
documents spanning four formats (PNG, DOCX, XLSX, PDF). Through table-based
extraction methods, our adaptive framework delivers outstanding results: F1=1.0
accuracy with 0.97s latency for structured documents, and F1=0.997 accuracy
with 0.6 s for challenging image inputs when integrated with PaddleOCR, all
while maintaining sub-second processing speeds. The 54 times performance
improvement compared with multimodal methods over naive approaches, coupled
with format-aware routing, enables processing of heterogeneous document streams
at production scale. Beyond the specific application to identity extraction,
this work establishes a general principle: the repetitive nature of copy-heavy
tasks can be transformed from a computational burden into an optimization
opportunity through structure-aware method selection.

### [119] [DiffHeads: Differential Analysis and Inference-Time Masking of Bias Heads in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10142)
*Tingxu Han,Wei Song,Ziqi Ding,Ziming Li,Chunrong Fang,Yuekang Li,Dongfang Liu,Zhenyu Chen,Zhenting Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes DiffHeads, a framework to reduce bias in large language models (LLMs) by analyzing attention head activations and selectively masking bias-inducing heads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a pressing need to address unfair treatment of demographic groups mediated through biased outputs in LLMs, as many existing mitigations are fragile and lack insight into the mechanisms generating bias.

Method: The approach involves analyzing token-to-head contributions to identify specific attention heads responsible for bias, comparing effects of Direct-Answer (DA) prompting and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, and applying differential activation analysis to mask bias-inducing heads.

Result: The study reveals that DA prompting exacerbates measured unfairness compared to CoT prompting. When bias-inducing attention heads are selectively masked using the DiffHeads framework, unfairness is reduced significantly by 49.4% for DA and 40.3% for CoT prompting.

Conclusion: DiffHeads offers a mechanism-driven approach to debiasing LLMs by pinpointing and masking bias-specific attention heads, improving fairness in outputs without degrading model utility.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate decisions in domains where
unfair treatment of demographic groups is unacceptable. Existing work probes
when biased outputs appear, but gives little insight into the mechanisms that
generate them, leaving existing mitigations largely fragile. In this paper, we
conduct a systematic investigation LLM unfairness and propose DiffHeads, a
lightweight debiasing framework for LLMs. We first compare Direct-Answer (DA)
prompting to Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting across eight representative open-
and closed-source LLMs. DA will trigger the nature bias part of LLM and improve
measured unfairness by 534.5%-391.9% in both one-turn and two-turn dialogues.
Next, we define a token-to-head contribution score that traces each token's
influence back to individual attention heads. This reveals a small cluster of
bias heads that activate under DA but stay largely dormant with CoT, providing
the first causal link between prompting strategy and bias emergence. Finally,
building on this insight, we propose DiffHeads that identifies bias heads
through differential activation analysis between DA and CoT, and selectively
masks only those heads. DiffHeads reduces unfairness by 49.4%, and 40.3% under
DA and CoT, respectively, without harming model utility.

*Tsung-Min Pai,Jui-I Wang,Li-Chun Lu,Shao-Hua Sun,Hung-Yi Lee,Kai-Wei Chang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BILLY improves creativity in large language models by blending various persona vectors in a single model, avoiding the computational and latency issues of multi-LLM systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-LLM systems are creative but suffer from high computational costs and inference latency. There is a need for a more efficient solution to induce multi-perspective creativity.

Method: The proposed framework, BILLY, uses persona vectors blended in the model's activation space to enable multi-perspective outputs without requiring multiple LLMs. It does this during inference and doesn’t require additional training.

Result: BILLY outperforms single LLM and traditional multi-LLM setups in creativity tests, while greatly reducing inference time and computational needs.

Conclusion: Blending persona vectors in a single model offers an effective, interpretable, and computationally efficient way to capture diverse perspectives and control over language model outputs.

Abstract: Multi-LLM systems enhance the creativity of large language models by
simulating human collective intelligence but suffer from significant drawbacks,
such as high computational costs and inference latency. To address these
limitations, we propose BILLY (BlendIng persona vectors for Large Language
model creativitY), a training-free framework that captures the benefits of
multi-LLM collaboration, i.e. inducing diverse perspectives and specialized
expertise, within a single model. BILLY operates by extracting and blending
multiple distinct persona vectors directly in the model's activation space. We
steer the model's generation process with this merged vector while inference,
enabling multi-perspective output without explicit multi-LLM communication. Our
experiments across creativity-oriented benchmarks demonstrate that BILLY
surpasses single model prompting and traditional multi-LLM approaches, while
substantially reducing inference time and computational costs. Our analyses
further reveal that distinct persona vectors can be blended to achieve both
effective control over complementary aspects of generation and greater
interpretability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates provenance tracking in large language models (LLMs) to address risks like hallucinations and biases, organized by model-centric and data-centric dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid adoption of LLMs across various fields faces risks stemming from their opaque nature and human-like outputs, necessitating methods to ensure accountability and trustworthiness.

Method: The paper proposes a four-dimensional framework categorizing sourcing methods and a dual-paradigm taxonomy to improve transparency in tracing content origins.

Result: It introduces structured techniques to trace model outputs back to training data or external influences, with implications for reducing risks such as bias and unfairness.

Conclusion: Provenance tracking enhances LLMs' transparency and credibility, ensuring responsible deployment across diverse applications.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized
artificial intelligence, shifting from supporting objective tasks (e.g.,
recognition) to empowering subjective decision-making (e.g., planning,
decision). This marks the dawn of general and powerful AI, with applications
spanning a wide range of fields, including programming, education, healthcare,
finance, and law. However, their deployment introduces multifaceted risks. Due
to the black-box nature of LLMs and the human-like quality of their generated
content, issues such as hallucinations, bias, unfairness, and copyright
infringement become particularly significant. In this context, sourcing
information from multiple perspectives is essential.
  This survey presents a systematic investigation into provenance tracking for
content generated by LLMs, organized around four interrelated dimensions that
together capture both model- and data-centric perspectives. From the model
perspective, Model Sourcing treats the model as a whole, aiming to distinguish
content generated by specific LLMs from content authored by humans. Model
Structure Sourcing delves into the internal generative mechanisms, analyzing
architectural components that shape the outputs of model. From the data
perspective, Training Data Sourcing focuses on internal attribution, tracing
the origins of generated content back to the training data of model. In
contrast, External Data Sourcing emphasizes external validation, identifying
external information used to support or influence the responses of model.
Moreover, we also propose a dual-paradigm taxonomy that classifies existing
sourcing methods into prior-based (proactive traceability embedding) and
posterior-based (retrospective inference) approaches. Traceability across these
dimensions enhances the transparency, accountability, and trustworthiness of
LLMs deployment in real-world applications.

TL;DR: This paper presents the first comprehensive survey of inductive reasoning in large language models (LLMs), outlining key methods, benchmarks, and evaluation approaches, while offering future research insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inductive reasoning is crucial for knowledge generalization and human-like cognition, but lacks a systematic summary, motivating a comprehensive survey.

Method: The paper categorizes methods to improve inductive reasoning into post-training, test-time scaling, and data augmentation; summarizes benchmarks; and introduces a unified evaluation approach with the observation coverage metric.

Result: It provides foundational analyses on the sources of inductive ability and how model architectures and data impact inductive reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: This work establishes a solid basis for advancing the understanding and improvement of inductive reasoning in LLMs, promoting further research in this area.

Abstract: Reasoning is an important task for large language models (LLMs). Among all
the reasoning paradigms, inductive reasoning is one of the fundamental types,
which is characterized by its particular-to-general thinking process and the
non-uniqueness of its answers. The inductive mode is crucial for knowledge
generalization and aligns better with human cognition, so it is a fundamental
mode of learning, hence attracting increasing interest. Despite the importance
of inductive reasoning, there is no systematic summary of it. Therefore, this
paper presents the first comprehensive survey of inductive reasoning for LLMs.
First, methods for improving inductive reasoning are categorized into three
main areas: post-training, test-time scaling, and data augmentation. Then,
current benchmarks of inductive reasoning are summarized, and a unified
sandbox-based evaluation approach with the observation coverage metric is
derived. Finally, we offer some analyses regarding the source of inductive
ability and how simple model architectures and data help with inductive tasks,
providing a solid foundation for future research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines the reasoning processes of LLM-based multi-agent medical consultation systems, identifying critical collaborative failure patterns and stressing the need for transparency beyond final-answer accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate if diagnostic conclusions from LLM-based multi-agent systems are reached through sound and verifiable reasoning processes, especially given the risks involved in high-stakes medical applications.

Method: A large-scale empirical study of 3,600 cases from six medical datasets and multi-agent frameworks using a mixed-methods approach combining qualitative and quantitative analysis. A taxonomy of collaborative failure modes was developed.

Result: Four dominant failure patterns were identified: flawed consensus arising from shared model deficiencies, suppression of correct minority opinions, ineffective discussion dynamics, and critical information loss during synthesis.

Conclusion: The study establishes that high accuracy isn't sufficient for clinical or public trust. Transparent and auditable reasoning processes are essential for deploying dependable medical AI systems.

Abstract: While large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems show promise in
simulating medical consultations, their evaluation is often confined to
final-answer accuracy. This practice treats their internal collaborative
processes as opaque "black boxes" and overlooks a critical question: is a
diagnostic conclusion reached through a sound and verifiable reasoning pathway?
The inscrutable nature of these systems poses a significant risk in high-stakes
medical applications, potentially leading to flawed or untrustworthy
conclusions. To address this, we conduct a large-scale empirical study of 3,600
cases from six medical datasets and six representative multi-agent frameworks.
Through a rigorous, mixed-methods approach combining qualitative analysis with
quantitative auditing, we develop a comprehensive taxonomy of collaborative
failure modes. Our quantitative audit reveals four dominant failure patterns:
flawed consensus driven by shared model deficiencies, suppression of correct
minority opinions, ineffective discussion dynamics, and critical information
loss during synthesis. This study demonstrates that high accuracy alone is an
insufficient measure of clinical or public trust. It highlights the urgent need
for transparent and auditable reasoning processes, a cornerstone for the
responsible development and deployment of medical AI.

*Bo Yuan,Yulin Chen,Yin Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes "Delora," a framework to decouple sample selection from training to improve on noisy label scenarios in fine-tuning large language models. It leverages clean and noisy LoRA for effective detection and handling of mislabeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models often struggles with noisy training labels, which negatively impact model performance. Current methods relying on loss-based sample selection can perpetuate errors, creating a suboptimal feedback loop.

Method: Delora introduces two separate LoRA components: clean LoRA to identify correctly labeled data and noisy LoRA to detect mislabeled data. These components work as a memory system to enable more precise sample selection while mitigating the impact on training.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world noisy datasets demonstrate Delora's improved performance in both noisy label detection and subsequent text classification tasks.

Conclusion: Delora effectively decouples sample selection from training and uses a learnable threshold mechanism to address challenges in noisy label settings, leading to enhanced fine-tuning performance of language models.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) large language models (LLMs) have
shown impressive performance in various downstream tasks. However, in many
real-world scenarios, the collected training data inevitably contains noisy
labels. To learn from noisy labels, most solutions select samples with small
losses for model training. However, the selected samples, in turn, impact the
loss computation in the next iteration. An inaccurate initial selection can
create a vicious cycle, leading to suboptimal performance. To break this cycle,
we propose Delora, a novel framework that decouples the sample selection from
model training. For sample selection, Delora establishes a noisy label detector
by introducing clean and noisy LoRA. Benefiting from the memory effect, the
clean LoRA is encouraged to memorize clean data, while the noisy LoRA is
constrained to memorize mislabeled data, which serves as a learnable threshold
for selecting clean and noisy samples. For model training, Delora can use
carefully selected samples to fine-tune language models seamlessly.
Experimental results on synthetic and real-world noisy datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of Delora in noisy label detection and text classification.

TL;DR: SyTTA is an inference-time framework enabling test-time adaptation of language models without labeled data, impactful for specialized domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models often struggle with domain-specific distribution shifts, requiring fine-tuning which depends on costly labeled data.

Method: SyTTA leverages input perplexity and output entropy as uncertainty signals to adapt the model at inference-time without supervision.

Result: For example, SyTTA improved performance on agricultural Q&A tasks with over 120% Rouge-LSum gain on Qwen-2.5-7B model while adding minimal tokens.

Conclusion: This approach demonstrates effective test-time adaptation without labeled examples, facilitating deployment in domains lacking expertise or labeled data.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in specialized domains
such as finance, medicine, and agriculture, where they face significant
distribution shifts from their training data. Domain-specific fine-tuning can
mitigate this challenge but relies on high-quality labeled data that is
expensive and slow to collect in expertise-limited settings. We study
label-free test-time adaptation for language models and present SyTTA, an
inference-time framework that adapts models on-the-fly without additional
supervision. SyTTA couples two complementary uncertainty signals that arise
under distribution shift: input-side perplexity, indicating mismatch with
domain-specific terminology and patterns, and output-side predictive entropy,
indicating diffuse and unstable token probabilities during generation. Across
diverse model architectures and domain-specific benchmarks, SyTTA delivers
consistent gains. Notably, on agricultural question answering, SyTTA improves
Rouge-LSum by over 120% on Qwen-2.5-7B with only 4 extra tokens per query.
These results show that effective test-time adaptation for language models is
achievable without labeled examples, supporting deployment in label-scarce
domains. The code will be made available upon acceptance.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an unsupervised generative framework, Text2Token, for text representation learning by linking representation space and token space. It achieves competitive results with state-of-the-art unsupervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to improve unsupervised text representation learning, which is critical for applications like search and recommendations, by investigating connections between representation space and vocabulary space.

Method: Text2Token utilizes token target prediction tasks with constructed target token distributions based on meaningful tokens and semantically derived tokens, through data-driven and model-derived approaches.

Result: Text2Token performs competitively on the MTEB v2 benchmark against state-of-the-art methods such as LLM2Vec, showing optimized interplay between vocabulary and representation spaces.

Conclusion: The paper provides insights into how vocabulary and representation spaces co-optimize during training, offering avenues for future research in unsupervised representation learning.

Abstract: Unsupervised text representation learning (TRL) is a fundamental task in
natural language processing, which is beneficial for improving search and
recommendations with the web's unlabeled texts. A recent empirical study finds
that the high-quality representation aligns with the key token of the input
text, uncovering the potential connection between representation space and
vocabulary space. Inspired by the findings, we revisit the generative tasks and
develop an unsupervised generative framework for TRL, Text2Token. The framework
is based on the token target prediction task, utilizing carefully constructed
target token distribution as supervisory signals. To construct the high-quality
target token distribution, we analyze the token-alignment properties with
advanced embedders and identify two essential categories of key tokens: (1) the
meaningful tokens in the text and (2) semantically derived tokens beyond the
text. Based on these insights, we propose two methods -- data-driven and
model-derived -- to construct synthetic token targets from data or the LLM
backbone. Experiments on the MTEB v2 benchmark demonstrate that Text2Token
achieves performance competitive with the state-of-the-art embedder with
unsupervised contrastive learning, LLM2Vec. Our analysis further shows that
vocabulary and representation spaces optimize together and toward the optimum
solution during training, providing new ideas and insights for future work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To combine the strengths of supervised neural methods and Large Language Models (LLMs) for advancing coreference resolution in NLP.

Method: Proposes ImCoref, an enhanced supervised method, and integrates it with an LLM as a reasoning agent. ImCoref includes a bridging module, a biaffine scorer, and hybrid mention regularization, while the LLM acts as a multi-role Checker-Splitter agent.

Result: Experiments show that ImCoref-CeS outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in coreference resolution tasks.

Conclusion: The integration of advanced supervised methods with LLM-based reasoning is effective and sets a new performance benchmark in coreference resolution.

Abstract: Coreference Resolution (CR) is a critical task in Natural Language Processing
(NLP). Current research faces a key dilemma: whether to further explore the
potential of supervised neural methods based on small language models, whose
detect-then-cluster pipeline still delivers top performance, or embrace the
powerful capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, effectively
combining their strengths remains underexplored. To this end, we propose
\textbf{ImCoref-CeS}, a novel framework that integrates an enhanced supervised
model with LLM-based reasoning. First, we present an improved CR method
(\textbf{ImCoref}) to push the performance boundaries of the supervised neural
method by introducing a lightweight bridging module to enhance long-text
encoding capability, devising a biaffine scorer to comprehensively capture
positional information, and invoking a hybrid mention regularization to improve
training efficiency. Importantly, we employ an LLM acting as a multi-role
Checker-Splitter agent to validate candidate mentions (filtering out invalid
ones) and coreference results (splitting erroneous clusters) predicted by
ImCoref. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ImCoref-CeS,
which achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Audit-of-Understanding (AoU), a novel framework to prevent reasoning-induced hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) by validating premises before inference. Empirical results show significant accuracy and faithfulness improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address reasoning-induced hallucinations in LLMs, a problem where models generate seemingly coherent conclusions based on unsupported assumptions, which has been underexplored compared to addressing factual hallucinations.

Method: The AoU framework constrains reasoning through three phases: query decomposition into assumptions, auditing their support, and conditioning inference only on validated premises. This is formalized as posterior-constrained inference.

Result: AoU achieves substantial improvements in accuracy and faithfulness across multiple benchmarks, with gains of up to +30% on GSM8K, +45% on MultiArith, and consistent +20–28% improvements on SVAMP over existing methods.

Conclusion: The AoU framework effectively mitigates reasoning-induced hallucinations by validating premises before inference, offering theoretical guarantees and significant empirical performance gains on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate reasoning traces that appear
coherent but rest on unsupported assumptions, leading to hallucinated
conclusions. Prior work mainly addresses factual hallucinations or relies on
post-hoc verification, leaving reasoning-induced hallucinations largely
unaddressed. We propose Audit-of-Understanding (AoU), a framework that
constrains inference to validated premises through three phases: (1)
decomposing a query into candidate assumptions, (2) auditing their support, and
(3) conditioning inference only on the validated subset. Formally, AoU is
\emph{posterior-constrained inference}, connecting to selective prediction and
rejection learning. Our contributions are threefold: (i) theoretical guarantees
under perfect validation, (ii) excess-risk bounds under imperfect audits, and
(iii) tractability analysis. Empirically, AoU improves both accuracy and
faithfulness on GSM8K, MultiArith, and SVAMP, achieving up to +30% gains on
GSM8K, +45% on MultiArith, and consistent +20--28% improvements on SVAMP over
Chain-of-Thought, Self-Consistency, and CoT-Decoding. Code is available at

*Liang Lin,Miao Yu,Moayad Aloqaily,Zhenhong Zhou,Kun Wang,Linsey Pang,Prakhar Mehrotra,Qingsong Wen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new defense against backdoor attacks on large language models (LLMs) that doesn't require prior knowledge of trigger settings, achieving significant improvements in both defense effectiveness and model utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defenses against backdoor attacks in LLMs are often impractical because they assume prior knowledge of the trigger settings, which is rarely available in real-world scenarios.

Method: The proposed method, called \ourmethod, involves a two-stage approach: first, injecting known triggers to aggregate backdoor representations in the model's representation space; second, performing recovery fine-tuning to restore the model's original benign outputs.

Result: The proposed method reduced the average Attack Success Rate to 4.41% across multiple benchmarks, outperforming existing baselines by margins of 28.1% to 69.3%, while maintaining clean accuracy and utility within 0.5% of the original model.

Conclusion: The method provides a robust and practical solution to backdoor attacks on LLMs, generalizing well across different types of backdoors and preserving overall model performance for legitimate tasks.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks are a significant threat to large language models (LLMs),
often embedded via public checkpoints, yet existing defenses rely on
impractical assumptions about trigger settings. To address this challenge, we
propose \ourmethod, a defense framework that requires no prior knowledge of
trigger settings. \ourmethod is based on the key observation that when
deliberately injecting known backdoors into an already-compromised model, both
existing unknown and newly injected backdoors aggregate in the representation
space. \ourmethod leverages this through a two-stage process: \textbf{first},
aggregating backdoor representations by injecting known triggers, and
\textbf{then}, performing recovery fine-tuning to restore benign outputs.
Extensive experiments across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate that: (I)
\ourmethod reduces the average Attack Success Rate to 4.41\% across multiple
benchmarks, outperforming existing baselines by 28.1\%$\sim$69.3\%$\uparrow$.
(II) Clean accuracy and utility are preserved within 0.5\% of the original
model, ensuring negligible impact on legitimate tasks. (III) The defense
generalizes across different types of backdoors, confirming its robustness in
practical deployment scenarios.

### [131] [On the Entity-Level Alignment in Crosslingual Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10280)
*Yihong Liu,Mingyang Wang,François Yvon,Hinrich Schütze*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores why multilingual LLMs fail in crosslingual consistency and proposes methods to improve factual recall by enhancing entity alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why multilingual LLMs struggle with consistent factual recall across different languages and address this issue by investigating entity alignment.

Method: The paper assesses entity alignment via entity-level translation tasks and proposes two methods, SubSub and SubInj, which add English translations to prompts to improve performance.

Result: Alignment is found to strongly correlate with crosslingual consistency; the methods result in better factual recall accuracy and consistency across languages.

Conclusion: Improving entity alignment strengthens multilingual LLM consistency, offering practical strategies for better multilingual predictions.

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) are expected to recall factual
knowledge consistently across languages. However, the factors that give rise to
such crosslingual consistency -- and its frequent failure -- remain poorly
understood. In this work, we hypothesize that these inconsistencies may arise
from failures in entity alignment, the process of mapping subject and object
entities into a shared conceptual space across languages. To test this, we
assess alignment through entity-level (subject and object) translation tasks,
and find that consistency is strongly correlated with alignment across all
studied models, with misalignment of subjects or objects frequently resulting
in inconsistencies. Building on this insight, we propose SubSub and SubInj, two
effective methods that integrate English translations of subjects into prompts
across languages, leading to substantial gains in both factual recall accuracy
and consistency. Finally, our mechanistic analysis reveals that these
interventions reinforce the entity representation alignment in the conceptual
space through model's internal pivot-language processing, offering effective
and practical strategies for improving multilingual factual prediction.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MatryoshkaThinking is a new test-time scaling method that reduces computational cost and achieves top-tier performance in language modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of existing test-time scaling methods like DeepConf, which incur high computational overhead to achieve competitive results during inference.

Method: MatryoshkaThinking employs recursive exploitation of intrinsic model capabilities like reasoning, verification, and summarization to improve correctness and narrow the gap between Pass@k and Pass@1.

Result: Achieved a score of 99.79 on AIME2025 using only 4% of the computation needed by the DeepConf method.

Conclusion: MatryoshkaThinking demonstrates its effectiveness and generalizability across various benchmarks, suggesting a scalable and efficient strategy for test-time inference in language models.

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as a promising paradigm in language modeling,
wherein additional computational resources are allocated during inference to
enhance model performance. Recent approaches, such as DeepConf, have
demonstrated the efficacy of this strategy, however, they often incur
substantial computational overhead to achieve competitive results. In this
work, we propose MatryoshkaThinking, a novel method that significantly reduces
computational cost while maintaining state-of-the-art performance.
Specifically, MatryoshkaThinking attains a score of 99.79 on AIME2025 using
only 4% of the computation required by DeepConf. The core of our approach lies
in the recursive exploitation of the model's intrinsic capabilities in
reasoning, verification, and summarization, which collectively enhance the
retention of correct solutions and reduce the disparity between Pass@k and
Pass@1. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple open-source models and
challenging multi-modal reasoning benchmarks validate the effectiveness and
generality of our method. These findings offer new insights into the design of
efficient and scalable test-time inference strategies for advanced language
models.

### [133] [Are LLMs Empathetic to All? Investigating the Influence of Multi-Demographic Personas on a Model's Empathy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10328)
*Ananya Malik,Nazanin Sabri,Melissa Karnaze,Mai Elsherief*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how empathetic responses of Large Language Models (LLMs) vary across different demographic personas and underlines the importance of inclusivity in model design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the concern of whether LLMs can provide equitable empathy across diverse user groups, considering the influence of demographic and cultural contexts.

Method: The researchers created 315 unique personas based on combinations of age, culture, and gender to analyze empathetic behavior across four LLMs, incorporating both quantitative and qualitative insights.

Result: Empathy patterns in LLMs vary significantly based on demographic attributes, with some misalignments, such as for Confucian cultural groups. Adding multiple attributes influences expected empathy trends.

Conclusion: Designing empathy-aware LLMs that account for demographic diversity is crucial for achieving inclusivity and equitable behavior across diverse user groups.

Abstract: Large Language Models' (LLMs) ability to converse naturally is empowered by
their ability to empathetically understand and respond to their users. However,
emotional experiences are shaped by demographic and cultural contexts. This
raises an important question: Can LLMs demonstrate equitable empathy across
diverse user groups? We propose a framework to investigate how LLMs' cognitive
and affective empathy vary across user personas defined by intersecting
demographic attributes. Our study introduces a novel intersectional analysis
spanning 315 unique personas, constructed from combinations of age, culture,
and gender, across four LLMs. Results show that attributes profoundly shape a
model's empathetic responses. Interestingly, we see that adding multiple
attributes at once can attenuate and reverse expected empathy patterns. We show
that they broadly reflect real-world empathetic trends, with notable
misalignments for certain groups, such as those from Confucian culture. We
complement our quantitative findings with qualitative insights to uncover model
behaviour patterns across different demographic groups. Our findings highlight
the importance of designing empathy-aware LLMs that account for demographic
diversity to promote more inclusive and equitable model behaviour.

*Nam Luu,Ondřej Bojar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a combined end-to-end architecture for speech translation (ST) using pre-trained speech encoders and Large Language Models (LLMs), achieving superior results in English-to-German translation compared to some existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the quality and effectiveness of Speech Translation (ST) by leveraging advancements in end-to-end systems that integrate pre-trained speech encoders and LLMs.

Method: The study combines pre-trained speech encoders and LLMs into a unified end-to-end architecture capable of performing Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and ST simultaneously.

Result: The proposed model outperformed SeamlessM4T and closely matched the performance of a cascaded system while achieving an 8% score improvement in the $	ext{COMET}^{\text{DA}}_{22}$ metric for English-to-German translation.

Conclusion: The integration of pre-trained speech encoders with LLMs in an end-to-end architecture is effective for ST tasks, providing competitive or better results compared to state-of-the-art systems.

Abstract: Speech Translation (ST) is a machine translation task that involves
converting speech signals from one language to the corresponding text in
another language; this task has two different approaches, namely the
traditional cascade and the more recent end-to-end. This paper explores a
combined end-to-end architecture of pre-trained speech encoders and Large
Language Models (LLMs) for performing both Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)
and ST simultaneously. Experiments with the English-to-German language pair
show that our best model not only can achieve better translation results than
SeamlessM4T, a large foundational end-to-end, multi-modal translation model,
but can also match the performance of a cascaded system with Whisper and NLLB,
with up to a score gain of 8% in $\text{COMET}^{\text{DA}}_{22}$ metric.

TL;DR: The study presents a Python package (ASC analyzer) for analyzing Argument Structure Constructions (ASCs) and linking them to L2 proficiency through indices such as diversity and frequency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the lack of scalable and systematic tools for analyzing ASCs to better assess second language proficiency.

Method: The authors developed the ASC analyzer tool, which automatically tags ASCs and calculates 50 indices involving diversity, proportion, frequency, and verb associations. Analyses were conducted using bivariate and multivariate methods.

Result: ASC-based indices demonstrated a clear relationship with L2 writing scores, showcasing the analyzer’s effectiveness in linking ASC usage to language proficiency.

Conclusion: This Python package provides a novel and systematic way to study ASCs, offering valuable insights into L2 writing proficiency through quantitative measurements.

Abstract: Argument structure constructions (ASCs) offer a theoretically grounded lens
for analyzing second language (L2) proficiency, yet scalable and systematic
tools for measuring their usage remain limited. This paper introduces the ASC
analyzer, a publicly available Python package designed to address this gap. The
analyzer automatically tags ASCs and computes 50 indices that capture
diversity, proportion, frequency, and ASC-verb lemma association strength. To
demonstrate its utility, we conduct both bivariate and multivariate analyses
that examine the relationship between ASC-based indices and L2 writing scores.

*Aashiq Muhamed,Leonardo F. R. Ribeiro,Markus Dreyer,Virginia Smith,Mona T. Diab*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces RefusalBench, a diagnostic framework for evaluating language models' ability to selectively refuse to answer based on flawed context, exposing significant gaps in current performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems often fail to selectively refuse flawed contexts, posing safety risks.

Method: The authors developed RefusalBench, a generative methodology with 176 linguistic perturbation strategies, to programmatically create diagnostic test cases across six categories of informational uncertainty and three levels of intensity.

Result: Evaluation of over 30 models revealed systematic failures in refusal capabilities, indicating that detection and categorization are separable skills unaffected by scale and reasoning depth.

Conclusion: Selective refusal is a trainable and alignment-sensitive skill, and the benchmarks and framework introduced here offer a pathway for improving and dynamically evaluating this critical feature.

Abstract: The ability of language models in RAG systems to selectively refuse to answer
based on flawed context is critical for safety, yet remains a significant
failure point. Our large-scale study reveals that even frontier models struggle
in this setting, with refusal accuracy dropping below 50% on multi-document
tasks, while exhibiting either dangerous overconfidence or overcaution. Static
benchmarks fail to reliably evaluate this capability, as models exploit
dataset-specific artifacts and memorize test instances. We introduce
RefusalBench, a generative methodology that programmatically creates diagnostic
test cases through controlled linguistic perturbation. Our framework employs
176 distinct perturbation strategies across six categories of informational
uncertainty and three intensity levels. Evaluation of over 30 models uncovers
systematic failure patterns: refusal comprises separable detection and
categorization skills, and neither scale nor extended reasoning improves
performance. We find that selective refusal is a trainable, alignment-sensitive
capability, offering a clear path for improvement. We release two benchmarks --
RefusalBench-NQ (single document) and RefusalBench-GaRAGe (multi-document) --
and our complete generation framework to enable continued, dynamic evaluation
of this critical capability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents AssoMem, which uses associative memory graphs and mutual information-driven fusion for better memory recall in question-answering tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in accurate recall from large-scale memories, especially in similarity-dense question-answering scenarios where reliance solely on semantic distance for retrieval is inadequate.

Method: AssoMem employs associative memory graphs to structure dialogue around extracted clues, enabling an organized context. It incorporates multi-dimensional retrieval signals such as relevance, importance, and temporal alignment, integrated via an adaptive mutual information-driven fusion strategy.

Result: The proposed method is validated through extensive experiments across three benchmarks and a new dataset, MeetingQA, where AssoMem outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines.

Conclusion: AssoMem demonstrates the effectiveness of combining associative memory structures with advanced retrieval signal fusion for improving context-aware memory recall in QA systems.

Abstract: Accurate recall from large scale memories remains a core challenge for memory
augmented AI assistants performing question answering (QA), especially in
similarity dense scenarios where existing methods mainly rely on semantic
distance to the query for retrieval. Inspired by how humans link information
associatively, we propose AssoMem, a novel framework constructing an
associative memory graph that anchors dialogue utterances to automatically
extracted clues. This structure provides a rich organizational view of the
conversational context and facilitates importance aware ranking. Further,
AssoMem integrates multi-dimensional retrieval signals-relevance, importance,
and temporal alignment using an adaptive mutual information (MI) driven fusion
strategy. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks and a newly introduced
dataset, MeetingQA, demonstrate that AssoMem consistently outperforms SOTA
baselines, verifying its superiority in context-aware memory recall.

### [138] [STEAM: A Semantic-Level Knowledge Editing Framework for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10398)
*Geunyeong Jeong,Juoh Sun,Seonghee Lee,Harksoo Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces an improved framework called STEAM for semantic-level knowledge editing in Large Language Models (LLMs), making updated knowledge better integrated and semantically coherent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing knowledge editing methods, which often fail to ensure semantic coherence and proper integration of updated knowledge into LLMs.

Method: The authors propose STEAM, which uses a two-step approach: 1) identifies target semantic anchors for updated facts, and 2) optimizes the internal representations using alignment loss to integrate the edited knowledge more naturally into the model's knowledge structure.

Result: Experiments show that STEAM improves the reasoning ability of LLMs when dealing with edited knowledge and enhances the semantic coherence of edited content.

Conclusion: STEAM demonstrates the importance of latent-space alignment in knowledge editing, providing a more reliable and coherent approach for updating LLMs without full retraining.

Abstract: Large Language Models store extensive factual knowledge acquired during
large-scale pre-training. However, this knowledge is inherently static,
reflecting only the state of the world at the time of training. Knowledge
editing has emerged as a promising solution for updating outdated or incorrect
facts without full retraining. However, most existing locate-and-edit methods
primarily focus on token-level likelihood optimization without addressing
semantic coherence. Our analysis reveals that such edited knowledge is often
encoded as isolated residual streams in the model's latent space, distinct from
pre-existing knowledge and bypassing natural reasoning process. To address
this, we propose \textsc{Steam}, a semantic-level knowledge editing framework
that enhances integration of updated knowledge into the model's knowledge
structure. \textsc{Steam} first identifies target representations as semantic
anchors for the updated factual association, then guides the internal
representation of the edited fact towards these anchors through an alignment
loss during optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that \textsc{Steam}
improves model's ability to reason with edited knowledge and enhances semantic
coherence, underscoring the importance of latent-space alignment for reliable
and coherent knowledge editing. The code is available at

*Federica Bologna,Tiffany Pan,Matthew Wilkens,Yue Guo,Lucy Lu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LongQAEval, an evaluative framework for long-form clinical QA systems, emphasizing its cost-effective and tailored approaches to ensure accuracy in high-expertise settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the resource-intensive challenge of evaluating long-form clinical QA systems, which demands medical expertise and consistent human judgments over lengthy texts.

Method: The approach involves annotating 300 real patient questions answered by physicians and LLMs, comparing coarse answer-level and fine-grained sentence-level evaluation across correctness, relevance, and safety.

Result: Findings reveal that fine-grained annotation improves agreement on correctness, coarse annotation improves relevance agreement, and safety judgments are inconsistent. Annotating fewer sentences can achieve reliability similar to coarse annotations, reducing costs.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into balancing evaluation depth and resource constraints, offering practical recommendations for QA evaluation in limited-resource, high-expertise scenarios.

Abstract: Evaluating long-form clinical question answering (QA) systems is
resource-intensive and challenging: accurate judgments require medical
expertise and achieving consistent human judgments over long-form text is
difficult. We introduce LongQAEval, an evaluation framework and set of
evaluation recommendations for limited-resource and high-expertise settings.
Based on physician annotations of 300 real patient questions answered by
physicians and LLMs, we compare coarse answer-level versus fine-grained
sentence-level evaluation over the dimensions of correctness, relevance, and
safety. We find that inter-annotator agreement (IAA) varies by dimension:
fine-grained annotation improves agreement on correctness, coarse improves
agreement on relevance, and judgments on safety remain inconsistent.
Additionally, annotating only a small subset of sentences can provide
reliability comparable to coarse annotations, reducing cost and effort.

### [140] [Do Audio LLMs Really LISTEN, or Just Transcribe? Measuring Lexical vs. Acoustic Emotion Cues Reliance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10444)
*Jingyi Chen,Zhimeng Guo,Jiyun Chun,Pichao Wang,Andrew Perrault,Micha Elsner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether large audio language models (LALMs) truly understand emotions from speech acoustics or rely mostly on lexical content, finding heavy lexical dependence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether LALMs genuinely process acoustic information for emotion understanding or over-rely on lexical content.

Method: The authors introduced LISTEN, a benchmark specifically designed to separate and test lexical vs. acoustic contributions to emotion understanding in six state-of-the-art LALMs.

Result: Findings indicate LALMs exhibit strong lexical reliance, struggle in scenarios with conflicting lexical and acoustic cues, and perform poorly on paralinguistic (non-lexical) tasks, suggesting limited acoustic sensitivity.

Conclusion: Current LALMs prioritize transcription over genuinely interpreting acoustic cues, and LISTEN serves as a tool to evaluate and improve emotion understanding in multimodal models.

Abstract: Understanding emotion from speech requires sensitivity to both lexical and
acoustic cues. However, it remains unclear whether large audio language models
(LALMs) genuinely process acoustic information or rely primarily on lexical
content. We present LISTEN (Lexical vs. Acoustic Speech Test for Emotion in
Narratives), a controlled benchmark designed to disentangle lexical reliance
from acoustic sensitivity in emotion understanding. Across evaluations of six
state-of-the-art LALMs, we observe a consistent lexical dominance. Models
predict "neutral" when lexical cues are neutral or absent, show limited gains
under cue alignment, and fail to classify distinct emotions under cue conflict.
In paralinguistic settings, performance approaches chance. These results
indicate that current LALMs largely "transcribe" rather than "listen," relying
heavily on lexical semantics while underutilizing acoustic cues. LISTEN offers
a principled framework for assessing emotion understanding in multimodal
models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RECON, a framework incorporating summarization to enhance context management in retrieval-augmented generation systems, leading to improved performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve inefficient management of long and noisy retrieved documents in RAG systems trained with RL and reasoning.

Method: RECON integrates an explicit summarization module with a relevance pretraining and multi-aspect distillation process.

Result: RECON reduces context length by 35%, improves training speed and latency, and boosts EM scores for QA tasks, especially in multi-hop scenarios.

Conclusion: Learned context compression is crucial for scalable and efficient RAG systems, which RECON effectively provides.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems trained using reinforcement
learning (RL) with reasoning are hampered by inefficient context management,
where long, noisy retrieved documents increase costs and degrade performance.
We introduce RECON (REasoning with CONdensation), a framework that integrates
an explicit summarization module to compress evidence within the reasoning
loop. Our summarizer is trained via a two-stage process: relevance pretraining
on QA datasets, followed by multi-aspect distillation from proprietary LLMs to
ensure factuality and clarity. Integrated into the Search-R1 pipeline, RECON
reduces total context length by 35\%, leading to improved training speed and
inference latency, while simultaneously improving RAG performance on downstream
QA benchmarks. Notably, it boosts the average EM score of the 3B model by
14.5\% and the 7B model by 3.0\%, showing particular strength in multi-hop QA.
RECON demonstrates that learned context compression is essential for building
practical, scalable, and performant RAG systems. Our code implementation is
made available at https://github.com/allfornancy/RECON.

*Utsav Maskey,Mark Dras,Usman Naseem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) often refuse benign requests due to aggressive safety filters, especially in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). The paper introduces "RagRefuse" to analyze refusal behaviors and proposes "SafeRAG-Steering" as a mitigation method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concern over over-refusals caused by safety alignment in large language models, especially when paired with retrieval-augmented generation systems.

Method: Creation of the RagRefuse benchmark to analyze over-refusal triggers and development of the SafeRAG-Steering intervention to address these issues without compromising legitimate refusals.

Result: RagRefuse highlights factors influencing over-refusals, such as domain and context contamination. SafeRAG-Steering successfully reduces over-refusals while maintaining necessary refusals.

Conclusion: SafeRAG-Steering proves effective in mitigating over-refusals in LLM pipelines, improving the balance between safety and usability.

Abstract: Safety alignment in large language models (LLMs) induces over-refusals --
where LLMs decline benign requests due to aggressive safety filters. We analyze
this phenomenon in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), where both the query
intent and retrieved context properties influence refusal behavior. We
construct RagRefuse, a domain-stratified benchmark spanning medical, chemical,
and open domains, pairing benign and harmful queries with controlled context
contamination patterns and sizes. Our analysis shows that context arrangement /
contamination, domain of query and context, and harmful-text density trigger
refusals even on benign queries, with effects depending on model-specific
alignment choices. To mitigate over-refusals, we introduce
\textsc{SafeRAG-Steering}, a model-centric embedding intervention that steers
the embedding regions towards the confirmed safe, non-refusing output regions
at inference time. This reduces over-refusals in contaminated RAG pipelines
while preserving legitimate refusals.

*Peng Fan,Wenping Wang,Fei Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes two methods, TIL and AXE Loss, to address speech-text alignment issues in ASR, achieving significant improvement in reducing frames.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the mismatch in speech length and text length, a major issue in automatic speech recognition.

Method: Two methods, Time Independence Loss (TIL) and Aligned Cross Entropy (AXE) Loss, are introduced along with frame fusion techniques to improve keyframe alignment.

Result: Experimental results on AISHELL-1 and AISHELL-2 datasets show improved performance, with a notable reduction of at least 86% in the number of frames.

Conclusion: The proposed methods are effective and better than prior approaches in tackling speech-text alignment issues for ASR.

Abstract: The mismatch of speech length and text length poses a challenge in automatic
speech recognition (ASR). In previous research, various approaches have been
employed to align text with speech, including the utilization of Connectionist
Temporal Classification (CTC). In earlier work, a key frame mechanism (KFDS)
was introduced, utilizing intermediate CTC outputs to guide downsampling and
preserve keyframes, but traditional methods (CTC) failed to align speech and
text appropriately when downsampling speech to a text-similar length. In this
paper, we focus on speech recognition in those cases where the length of speech
aligns closely with that of the corresponding text. To address this issue, we
introduce two methods for alignment: a) Time Independence Loss (TIL) and b)
Aligned Cross Entropy (AXE) Loss, which is based on edit distance. To enhance
the information on keyframes, we incorporate frame fusion by applying weights
and summing the keyframe with its context 2 frames. Experimental results on
AISHELL-1 and AISHELL-2 dataset subsets show that the proposed methods
outperform the previous work and achieve a reduction of at least 86\% in the
number of frames.

TL;DR: This paper introduces EssenceBench, a framework using a Genetic Algorithm to compress benchmarks while preserving model ranking and accuracy with significantly fewer samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a growing need for systematically evaluating models across various capabilities, but current benchmark suites are too large, making redundancy reduction and accurate model ranking challenging.

Method: The paper introduces EssenceBench, which uses a Genetic Algorithm in a coarse-to-fine approach to iteratively optimize benchmark compression. The method combines fitness-based subset search and attribution-based sample search to retain critical evaluation capability.

Result: EssenceBench outperforms existing methods, achieving superior compression with minimal reconstruction error, efficiency gains, and remarkable preservation of model rankings. For example, it compressed the HellaSwag benchmark by 25x while maintaining rank consistency within a 5% threshold.

Conclusion: EssenceBench provides an effective and efficient framework for benchmark compression, ensuring both prediction accuracy and ranking stability, addressing limitations in previous methods.

Abstract: As the demand for comprehensive evaluations of diverse model capabilities
steadily increases, benchmark suites have correspondingly grown significantly
in scale. Despite notable advances in redundancy reduction and subset-level
performance prediction, a systematic framework that effectively integrates
these methods to ensure both prediction accuracy and ranking consistency is
still largely elusive. In this paper, we first perform a sample-level analysis
of benchmark redundancy and identify several highly similar samples that can be
eliminated. Besides, we frame benchmark compression as an optimization problem
with the aim of score reconstruction. Building on these, we then propose
EssenceBench, a coarse-to-fine framework utilizing an iterative Genetic
Algorithm (GA), which takes the advantages of fitness-based subset search and
attribution-based sample search. Compared to previous methods, our approach
yields superior compression results with lower reconstruction error and
markedly higher efficiency. In particular, on the HellaSwag benchmark (10K
samples), our method preserves the ranking of all models shifting within 5%
using 25x fewer samples, and achieves 95% ranking preservation shifting within
5% using only 200x fewer samples.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a universal ideographic metalanguage to bridge the digital divide, using Neuro-symbolic AI to assist individuals with low academic literacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address communication barriers faced by individuals with lower academic literacy, worsened by the digital divide.

Method: The researchers developed a communication framework combining neuro-symbolic AI and NSM theory, engaging 200 semi-literate participants for ideograph selection and system validation.

Result: The system achieved over 80% semantic comprehensibility, had an accessible learning curve, and demonstrated universal adaptability.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully helps underprivileged populations in digital communication, making ideas more accessible using atomic semantic concepts.

Abstract: Digital communication has become the cornerstone of modern interaction,
enabling rapid, accessible, and interactive exchanges. However, individuals
with lower academic literacy often face significant barriers, exacerbating the
"digital divide". In this work, we introduce a novel, universal ideographic
metalanguage designed as an innovative communication framework that transcends
academic, linguistic, and cultural boundaries. Our approach leverages
principles of Neuro-symbolic AI, combining neural-based large language models
(LLMs) enriched with world knowledge and symbolic knowledge heuristics grounded
in the linguistic theory of Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM). This enables
the semantic decomposition of complex ideas into simpler, atomic concepts.
Adopting a human-centric, collaborative methodology, we engaged over 200
semi-literate participants in defining the problem, selecting ideographs, and
validating the system. With over 80\% semantic comprehensibility, an accessible
learning curve, and universal adaptability, our system effectively serves
underprivileged populations with limited formal education.

*Qiran Zou,Hou Hei Lam,Wenhao Zhao,Yiming Tang,Tingting Chen,Samson Yu,Tianyi Zhang,Chang Liu,Xiangyang Ji,Dianbo Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces FML-bench, a benchmark for evaluating automatic machine learning research agents using diverse and fundamental ML problems, focusing on breadth of exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for machine learning research agents overly focus on engineering and application-oriented tasks, neglecting academic rigor and scalability for realistic research settings.

Method: The authors propose FML-bench, a benchmark structured around eight diverse machine learning problems, paired with an evaluation framework utilizing five complementary metrics to comprehensively assess agent performance.

Result: Evaluation of state-of-the-art research agents demonstrates that those exploring broadly across research problems outperform agents focused on deep, narrow exploration.

Conclusion: Prioritizing breadth in exploratory strategies over incremental refinement leads to more effective outcomes in machine learning research and development.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have sparked growing interest in automatic
machine learning research agents. Among them, agents capable of autonomously
proposing ideas and conducting machine learning experiments are particularly
promising, as they maximize research automation and accelerate scientific
progress by iteratively refining ideas based on experimental results. However,
comprehensively evaluating such agents remains challenging. Existing benchmarks
tend to overemphasize engineering aspects while neglecting academic rigor,
creating barriers that obscure a clear assessment of an agent's scientific
capabilities in machine learning research. They also suffer from limited task
diversity, an overemphasis on application-oriented tasks over fundamental
research problems, and limited scalability to realistic research settings. To
address these limitations, we introduce FML-bench, a benchmark designed to
evaluate automatic machine learning research agents on 8 diverse and
fundamental machine learning research problems. It reduces coding burden,
emphasizes fundamental problems rather than specific use cases, offers high
task diversity, and is extensible to real-world machine learning GitHub
repositories. Furthermore, we present a unified evaluation framework with five
complementary metrics, designed to comprehensively assess agent performance on
our benchmark. We evaluate state-of-the-art automatic research agents on
FML-bench, and find that agents employing broad research exploration strategies
outperform those focusing on narrow but deep exploration. These findings
suggest that emphasizing the breadth of exploration may lead to more effective
research outcomes than focusing solely on incremental refinement. Our benchmark
is available at https://github.com/qrzou/FML-bench.

### [147] [When or What? Understanding Consumer Engagement on Digital Platforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10474)
*Jingyi Wu,Junying Liang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores how content timing and contextual factors outweigh the importance of content features in driving popularity on digital platforms, using TED Talks as a case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding between what content audiences value versus what creators believe is important, especially in terms of timing and thematic supply.

Method: Applied Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for thematic analysis on a large dataset of TED Talks while comparing creator supply with audience engagement demand. Conducted a longitudinal analysis on temporal effects.

Result: Found consistent mismatches between the content offered by creators and audience preferences. Temporal dynamics were observed to have a greater influence on engagement than thematic content.

Conclusion: Challenges the idea that content features are the main driver of popularity, emphasizing instead the role of timing and contextual factors. Offers actionable insights for content creators, marketers, and platform managers.

Abstract: Understanding what drives popularity is critical in today's digital service
economy, where content creators compete for consumer attention. Prior studies
have primarily emphasized the role of content features, yet creators often
misjudge what audiences actually value. This study applies Latent Dirichlet
Allocation (LDA) modeling to a large corpus of TED Talks, treating the platform
as a case of digital service provision in which creators (speakers) and
consumers (audiences) interact. By comparing the thematic supply of creators
with the demand expressed in audience engagement, we identify persistent
mismatches between producer offerings and consumer preferences. Our
longitudinal analysis further reveals that temporal dynamics exert a stronger
influence on consumer engagement than thematic content, suggesting that when
content is delivered may matter more than what is delivered. These findings
challenge the dominant assumption that content features are the primary drivers
of popularity and highlight the importance of timing and contextual factors in
shaping consumer responses. The results provide new insights into consumer
attention dynamics on digital platforms and carry practical implications for
marketers, platform managers, and content creators seeking to optimize audience
engagement strategies.

*A H M Rezaul Karim,Ozlem Uzuner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper describes a method to extract medical orders from conversational transcripts using a large language model without domain-specific fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to structure medical orders from diverse and extended conversational sources to improve clinical decision-making and workflow automation.

Method: The authors use the instruction-tuned LLaMA-4 model in a few-shot learning approach with one example for extracting medical orders.

Result: The approach ranked 5th among 17 teams with an average F1 score of 37.76. It significantly improved accuracy in identifying reasons and provenance.

Conclusion: Large, domain-agnostic LLMs with strong prompt engineering can effectively address specialized clinical NLP tasks, providing a scalable baseline.

Abstract: Medical order extraction is essential for structuring actionable clinical
information, supporting decision-making, and enabling downstream applications
such as documentation and workflow automation. Orders may be embedded in
diverse sources, including electronic health records, discharge summaries, and
multi-turn doctor-patient dialogues, and can span categories such as
medications, laboratory tests, imaging studies, and follow-up actions. The
MEDIQA-OE 2025 shared task focuses on extracting structured medical orders from
extended conversational transcripts, requiring the identification of order
type, description, reason, and provenance. We present the MasonNLP submission,
which ranked 5th among 17 participating teams with 105 total submissions. Our
approach uses a general-purpose, instruction-tuned LLaMA-4 17B model without
domain-specific fine-tuning, guided by a single in-context example. This
few-shot configuration achieved an average F1 score of 37.76, with notable
improvements in reason and provenance accuracy. These results demonstrate that
large, non-domain-specific LLMs, when paired with effective prompt engineering,
can serve as strong, scalable baselines for specialized clinical NLP tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores extending the context window of diffusion language models through post-training techniques without retraining from scratch, proposing effective positional embedding modifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the uncharted long-context behavior of diffusion language models and to enable efficient scaling to extended context windows without extensive retraining.

Method: The authors proposed a modified Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) technique compatible with diffusion processes and compared masking strategies during post-training for stability and performance.

Result: The UltraLLaDA model achieved a context window of 128K tokens, significantly outperforming other training-free baselines in long-context tasks.

Conclusion: Specialized positional embedding extensions can enable diffusion LLMs to scale to 128K-token contexts efficiently, offering practical guidance for practitioners.

Abstract: Diffusion LLMs have attracted growing interest, with plenty of recent work
emphasizing their great potential in various downstream tasks; yet the
long-context behavior of diffusion LLMs remains largely uncharted. We present a
case study of post-training techniques for extending the context window of
diffusion LLMs (i.e., LLaDA) without retraining from scratch. We show that a
simple modification to the standard Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE)
extension effectively accommodates the probabilistic modeling inherent in the
diffusion process, enabling stable scaling to longer context ranges. We further
compare masking strategies used during post-training and analyze their impact
on optimization stability and long-range recall. Instantiating these insights,
we introduce UltraLLaDA, a diffusion LLM with a 128K-token context window that,
in our empirical evaluation on long-context tasks, significantly outperforms
training-free baselines. Our experimental results highlight the special
positional extension as a key lever for scaling diffusion LLMs to extended
contexts and offer practical guidance for practitioners seeking 128K-scale
context via efficient post-training.

*Prawaal Sharma,Poonam Goyal,Vidisha Sharma,Navneet Goyal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: UNESCO has identified 2500 endangered languages globally. The paper proposes VOLTAGE, a contrastive learning-based OCR system, focusing on Takri script, achieving high accuracy rates for both printed and handwritten text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Digital inclusion for low-resource languages is vital to prevent their extinction, as current OCR approaches are inadequate for such languages.

Method: The paper introduces VOLTAGE, combining contrastive learning, auto-glyph feature recommendation for cluster-based labeling, data augmentation using image transformations, and GANs.

Result: VOLTAGE achieved 95% accuracy for printed samples and 87% accuracy for handwritten samples of Takri script. Results on other Indic scripts support the universal applicability of the methodology.

Conclusion: VOLTAGE addresses the digital inclusion gap for endangered languages, proving effective for both Takri and other scripts, and enabling downstream use cases for preserving low-resource languages.

Abstract: UNESCO has classified 2500 out of 7000 languages spoken worldwide as
endangered. Attrition of a language leads to loss of traditional wisdom, folk
literature, and the essence of the community that uses it. It is therefore
imperative to bring digital inclusion to these languages and avoid its
extinction. Low resource languages are at a greater risk of extinction. Lack of
unsupervised Optical Character Recognition(OCR) methodologies for low resource
languages is one of the reasons impeding their digital inclusion. We propose
VOLTAGE - a contrastive learning based OCR methodology, leveraging auto-glyph
feature recommendation for cluster-based labelling. We augment the labelled
data for diversity and volume using image transformations and Generative
Adversarial Networks. Voltage has been designed using Takri - a family of
scripts used in 16th to 20th century in the Himalayan regions of India. We
present results for Takri along with other Indic scripts (both low and high
resource) to substantiate the universal behavior of the methodology. An
accuracy of 95% for machine printed and 87% for handwritten samples on Takri
script has been achieved. We conduct baseline and ablation studies along with
building downstream use cases for Takri, demonstrating the usefulness of our
work.

TL;DR: The paper introduces AdvPrompt, an adversarial prompting approach to make large reasoning models (LRMs) generate concise outputs without sacrificing accuracy, significantly reducing token usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the high computational overhead and latency issues associated with the lengthy reasoning process of large reasoning models, which hinder their practical deployment.

Method: The paper proposes AdvPrompt, an iterative refinement framework that generates adversarial prompts to elicit concise yet accurate responses from both open-source and closed-source large reasoning models.

Result: Experiments show that AdvPrompt achieves a 3x reduction in response length on simple GSM8K questions for the Qwen3 models and reduces token usage by ~40% on four benchmarks. It also reduces token usage on MATH-500 by 35% for Claude-3.7 and 47% for Gemini-2.5.

Conclusion: AdvPrompt effectively reduces token usage while maintaining performance, demonstrating its practicality and generalizability across various model types and scales for enhancing LRM efficiency.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
tackling complex reasoning tasks through step-by-step thinking. However, such a
lengthy reasoning process incurs substantial computational and latency
overheads, hindering the practical deployment of these models. In this work, we
present a new perspective on mitigating overthinking in LRMs via black-box
adversarial prompting. By treating both open-source LRMs and closed-source APIs
as black-box communicators, we investigate how to elicit concise responses
without sacrificing accuracy. We introduce AdvPrompt, an iterative refinement
framework that generates high-quality adversarial prompts from diverse
perspectives. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that AdvPrompt
consistently reduces token usage while preserving performance. Notably,
AdvPrompt achieves a 3x reduction in average response length on simple GSM8K
questions for the Qwen3 model series, and delivers an average ~40% token
reduction across four benchmarks. For closed-source APIs, AdvPrompt reduces
token usage on MATH-500 by 35% for Claude-3.7 and 47% for Gemini-2.5. Further
analysis reveals the generalizability of AdvPrompt across various model scales
and families, underscoring the potential of black-box prompting as a practical
and effective strategy for enhancing LRM efficiency.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Feedback-Guided Dynamic Interactive Planning (FGDIP), a novel framework improving multi-hop reasoning in open-domain tasks for language models, achieving superior results on datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing language agents struggle with open-domain multi-hop reasoning due to rigid action sequences and limited information retrieval capabilities.

Method: FGDIP dynamically and adaptively identifies and explores key entities using feedback-guided refinements, combining error analysis and depth-first search for systematic convergence in reasoning.

Result: FGDIP achieved significant performance improvements with a 54.47% F1 score on HotpotQA and 70.05% on StrategyQA, outperforming baseline methods by 5.03% and 7.25% respectively.

Conclusion: FGDIP demonstrates enhanced adaptability and accuracy in open-domain multi-hop reasoning, proving valuable in advancing reasoning capabilities in large language models.

Abstract: Recent advancements in language agents have led to significant improvements
in multi-hop reasoning tasks. However, existing approaches often struggle with
handling open-domain problems, which require massive information retrieval due
to their reliance on a fixed sequence of actions. To address this, we propose
Feedback-Guided Dynamic Interactive Planning (FGDIP), a novel framework
tailored to enhance reasoning in LLMs by utilizing dynamic and adaptive
strategies for information exploration in open-domain multi-hop reasoning
tasks. Our approach begins by identifying key entities relevant to the problem,
which serve as the initial nodes in the reasoning process. From these initial
nodes, we then generate reasoning child nodes with the process being refined
through a combination of historical error analysis and real-time feedback,
which allows the framework to dynamically adjust and optimize its reasoning
strategies. By integrating depth-first search with an innovative node
generation technique, our framework adapts based on both prior error paths and
concurrently generated nodes at the same hierarchical level. This dynamic
strategy effectively expands the search space while ensuring the reasoning
process systematically converges toward accurate solutions. Experimental
results show that FGDIP achieved up to 54.47% F1 score on the HotpotQA dataset
and 70.05% on the StrategyQA dataset, surpassing the best baseline by 5.03% and
7.25% respectively, highlighting its versatility and potential to enhance
language agents in multi-hop reasoning tasks.

### [153] [Detecting Hallucinations in Authentic LLM-Human Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10539)
*Yujie Ren,Niklas Gruhlke,Anne Lauscher*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AuthenHallu, a benchmark for detecting hallucinations in large language models (LLMs), is based on real LLM-human dialogues rather than simulated scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks don't effectively capture hallucinations that occur in real-world LLM-user interactions.

Method: AuthenHallu was built by selecting and annotating authentic LLM-human dialogues without artificial manipulation.

Result: Hallucinations were found in 31.4% of interactions overall, reaching up to 60% in complex domains such as math.

Conclusion: Vanilla LLMs show potential for hallucination detection but currently cannot perform reliably in practical settings.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in sensitive domains
such as medicine and law, hallucination detection has become a critical task.
Although numerous benchmarks have been proposed to advance research in this
area, most of them are artificially constructed--either through deliberate
hallucination induction or simulated interactions--rather than derived from
genuine LLM-human dialogues. Consequently, these benchmarks fail to fully
capture the characteristics of hallucinations that occur in real-world usage.
To address this limitation, we introduce AuthenHallu, the first hallucination
detection benchmark built entirely from authentic LLM-human interactions. For
AuthenHallu, we select and annotate samples from genuine LLM-human dialogues,
thereby providing a faithful reflection of how LLMs hallucinate in everyday
user interactions. Statistical analysis shows that hallucinations occur in
31.4% of the query-response pairs in our benchmark, and this proportion
increases dramatically to 60.0% in challenging domains such as Math & Number
Problems. Furthermore, we explore the potential of using vanilla LLMs
themselves as hallucination detectors and find that, despite some promise,
their current performance remains insufficient in real-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces BitMar, a compact multimodal transformer for edge devices, integrating aggressive quantization with memory-enhancing features to achieve efficient image-text generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying vision-language models on edge devices is challenging due to their memory and computation-intensive structure.

Method: BitMar combines highly-quantized 1.58-bit encoders for text and vision with an external episodic memory for context-enhanced generation. The model uses per-layer conditioning and a sliding-window attention mechanism to optimize performance under resource constraints.

Result: BitMar achieves competitive multimodal understanding and image-text generation at low latency with a small model size, making it efficient for edge deployment.

Conclusion: The proposed approach demonstrates a strong quality-speed trade-off, showcasing the potential of memory-augmented, quantized architectures for edge environments.

Abstract: Cross-attention transformers and other multimodal vision-language models
excel at grounding and generation; however, their extensive, full-precision
backbones make it challenging to deploy them on edge devices. Memory-augmented
architectures enhance the utilization of past context; however, most works
rarely pair them with aggressive edge-oriented quantization. We introduce
BitMar, a quantized multimodal transformer that proposes an external human-like
episodic memory for effective image-text generation on hardware with limited
resources. BitMar utilizes 1.58-bit encoders, one for text (BitNet-style) and
one for vision (DiNOv2-based), to create compact embeddings that are combined
and used to query a fixed-size key-value episodic memory. During vector
retrieval, the BitNet decoder applies per-layer conditioning, which increases
the contextual relevance of generated content. The decoder also employs
attention sinks with a sliding-window mechanism to process long or streaming
inputs under tight memory budgets. The combination of per-layer conditioning
and sliding-window attention achieves a strong quality-speed trade-off,
delivering competitive captioning and multimodal understanding at low latency
with a small model footprint. These characteristics make BitMar well-suited for
edge deployment.

*Di Wu abd Shuaidong Pan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework leveraging temporal large language models to analyze dynamic topic evolution in text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of modeling and understanding how topics evolve, expand, or decline dynamically in large-scale text corpora.

Method: The framework uses large language models for contextual embeddings, incorporates temporal decay and attention mechanisms, maps into a latent topic space, and applies a state transition matrix for topic evolution, constrained by a joint optimization objective.

Result: The proposed framework captures topic dynamics effectively and outperforms existing models on various metrics through experiments on real-world corpora.

Conclusion: This approach offers a systematic and interpretable method for modeling dynamic semantic patterns, improving topic coherence, and supporting text analysis across multiple domains.

Abstract: This paper proposes a modeling framework for dynamic topic evolution based on
temporal large language models. The method first uses a large language model to
obtain contextual embeddings of text and then introduces a temporal decay
function and an attention mechanism. These components allow the model to adjust
the importance of semantic units according to time intervals and capture topic
variations across different periods. The temporal representations are then
mapped into a latent topic space, where a state transition matrix is applied to
describe the dynamic evolution of topics. A joint optimization objective
constrains both semantic modeling and temporal consistency, ensuring diversity
and smoothness in topic generation. The design emphasizes the unified modeling
of semantic representation and temporal evolution, which improves topic
coherence and diversity while enhancing stability and interpretability over
time. Experiments on real-world corpora show that the framework effectively
captures the generation, expansion, and decline of topics and outperforms
existing models across multiple metrics. Overall, the proposed method provides
a systematic solution for understanding dynamic semantic patterns in
large-scale text, enriches the research paradigm of topic modeling, and
supports complex text analysis tasks in multiple domains.

*Bowei He,Lihao Yin,Huiling Zhen,Shuqi Liu,Han Wu,Xiaokun Zhang,Mingxuan Yuan,Chen Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores the impact of calibration data on language model (LLM) capabilities post-compression and identifies activation pattern diversity as critical. It proposes a data curation framework to improve compression methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research recognizes the role of calibration data in compression methods but lacks comprehensive analysis on how these data impact different LLM capabilities, such as reasoning or domain correspondence.

Method: The paper systematically investigates calibration data impacts on complex reasoning tasks like math problem solving and code generation, analyzing activation patterns. It proposes a framework for curating calibration data based on representativeness and diversity.

Result: The framework enhances the effectiveness of post-training compression methods, preserving critical LLM capabilities better than before.

Conclusion: Activation pattern diversity and representativeness are critical for effective calibration data in compression. The proposed curation framework improves LLM performance after compression.

Abstract: Post-training compression has been a widely employed approach to scale down
large language model (LLM) and facilitate efficient inference. In various
proposed compression methods, including pruning and quantization, calibration
data plays a vital role by informing the weight importance and activation
dynamic ranges. However, how calibration data impacts the LLM capability after
compression is less explored. Few of the existing works, though recognizing the
significance of this study, only investigate the language modeling or
commonsense reasoning performance degradation from limited angles, like the
data sources or sample amounts. More systematic research is still needed to
examine the impacts on different LLM capabilities in terms of compositional
properties and domain correspondence of calibration data. In this work, we aim
at bridging this gap and further analyze underlying influencing mechanisms from
the activation pattern perspective. Especially, we explore the calibration
data's impacts on high-level complex reasoning capabilities, like math problem
solving and code generation. Delving into the underlying mechanism, we find
that the representativeness and diversity in activation space more
fundamentally determine the quality of calibration data. Finally, we propose a
calibration data curation framework based on such observations and analysis,
enhancing the performance of existing post-training compression methods on
preserving critical LLM capabilities. Our code is provided in

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the task of Epistemic Appeal Identification, developing a dataset called FactAppeal with 3,226 annotated sentences to capture nuanced factual appeals, and evaluating models to achieve a best macro-F1 score of 0.73.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need to understand how factual claims in text are made credible through external evidence or sources, a concept overlooked by prior research that focuses only on claim detection and verification.

Method: The authors created a dataset (FactAppeal) of 3,226 annotated sentences with span-level details about factual statements, source types, and evidence. They also trained and tested encoder and generative decoder models ranging from 2B to 9B parameters.

Result: They achieved their best result using the Gemma 2 9B model, obtaining a macro-F1 score of 0.73.

Conclusion: The task of Epistemic Appeal Identification can be effectively modeled, and the FactAppeal dataset offers a foundational resource for analyzing how factual statements in news are anchored by evidence and sources.

Abstract: How is a factual claim made credible? We propose the novel task of Epistemic
Appeal Identification, which identifies whether and how factual statements have
been anchored by external sources or evidence. To advance research on this
task, we present FactAppeal, a manually annotated dataset of 3,226
English-language news sentences. Unlike prior resources that focus solely on
claim detection and verification, FactAppeal identifies the nuanced epistemic
structures and evidentiary basis underlying these claims and used to support
them. FactAppeal contains span-level annotations which identify factual
statements and mentions of sources on which they rely. Moreover, the
annotations include fine-grained characteristics of factual appeals such as the
type of source (e.g. Active Participant, Witness, Expert, Direct Evidence),
whether it is mentioned by name, mentions of the source's role and epistemic
credentials, attribution to the source via direct or indirect quotation, and
other features. We model the task with a range of encoder models and generative
decoder models in the 2B-9B parameter range. Our best performing model, based
on Gemma 2 9B, achieves a macro-F1 score of 0.73.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study analyzes and compares the factual reporting styles of CNN and Fox News during politicized events, revealing distinct epistemic strategies in their reporting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the epistemic strategies behind factual reporting in media to complement existing research on media bias.

Method: An article matching strategy is employed to compare CNN and Fox News articles on the same events from a 470K-article corpus during the COVID-19 pandemic and Israel-Hamas war, analyzed using the FactAppeal framework.

Result: CNN includes more factual statements and relies more on external sources, often citing experts and formal documents, while Fox News prefers news reports and direct quotes.

Conclusion: Partisan media outlets adopt distinct epistemic strategies to construct reality, providing a novel perspective on media bias.

Abstract: While media bias is widely studied, the epistemic strategies behind factual
reporting remain computationally underexplored. This paper analyzes these
strategies through a large-scale comparison of CNN and Fox News. To isolate
reporting style from topic selection, we employ an article matching strategy to
compare reports on the same events and apply the FactAppeal framework to a
corpus of over 470K articles covering two highly politicized periods: the
COVID-19 pandemic and the Israel-Hamas war. We find that CNN's reporting
contains more factual statements and is more likely to ground them in external
sources. The outlets also exhibit sharply divergent sourcing patterns: CNN
builds credibility by citing Experts} and Expert Documents, constructing an
appeal to formal authority, whereas Fox News favors News Reports and direct
quotations. This work quantifies how partisan outlets use systematically
different epistemic strategies to construct reality, adding a new dimension to
the study of media bias.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in monolithic LLM architectures for text-to-SQL tasks, particularly with complex reasoning and schema diversity.

Method: Introducing a multi-agent framework utilizing modular components: a reasoning agent, a coding agent, a refinement step, and an adaptive routing system for balanced efficiency and accuracy.

Result: AGENTIQL achieves up to 86.07% execution accuracy using 14B models on the Spider benchmark, narrowing the gap to GPT-4 at 89.65% while offering better interpretability.

Conclusion: AGENTIQL is a scalable, interpretable, and accurate framework for semantic parsing, leveraging multi-agent collaboration and smaller open-source LLMs.

Abstract: LLMs have advanced text-to-SQL generation, yet monolithic architectures
struggle with complex reasoning and schema diversity. We propose AGENTIQL, an
agent-inspired multi-expert framework that combines a reasoning agent for
question decomposition, a coding agent for sub-query generation, and a
refinement step for column selection. An adaptive router further balances
efficiency and accuracy by selecting between our modular pipeline and a
baseline parser. Several steps in the pipeline can be executed in parallel,
making the framework scalable to larger workloads. Evaluated on the Spider
benchmark, AGENTIQL improves execution accuracy and interpretability and
achieves up to 86.07\% EX with 14B models using the Planner&Executor merging
strategy. The attained performance is contingent upon the efficacy of the
routing mechanism, thereby narrowing the gap to GPT-4-based SOTA (89.65% EX)
while using much smaller open-source LLMs. Beyond accuracy, AGENTIQL enhances
transparency by exposing intermediate reasoning steps, offering a robust,
scalable, and interpretable approach to semantic parsing.

TL;DR: This paper introduces BrowserAgent, an interactive approach for tackling complex browser-based tasks through human-like actions, outperforming existing methods like Search-R1 in multi-hop QA tasks with improved reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to emulate human browsing behaviors like scrolling, clicking, and typing to solve web-based tasks, addressing limitations of previous models that rely on converting dynamic web environments into static text.

Method: BrowserAgent employs predefined browser interactions through Playwright and utilizes a two-stage training process, comprising Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Rejection Fine-Tuning (RFT), to boost generalization.

Result: BrowserAgent demonstrates superior performance, achieving around 20% improvement over Search-R1 on multi-hop QA tasks such as HotpotQA, 2Wiki, and Bamboogle, despite lesser training data.

Conclusion: The results suggest that BrowserAgent, with its interactive approach and memory mechanism, is a more advanced and scalable framework for web-based tasks compared to existing models.

Abstract: Efficiently solving real-world problems with LLMs increasingly hinges on
their ability to interact with dynamic web environments and autonomously
acquire external information. While recent research like Search-R1 and
WebDancer demonstrates strong performance in solving web tasks, they heavily
rely on additional tools to convert the interactive web environment into static
text content. This is in contrast to human browsing behaviors, which involve
diverse interactions with the browser, such as scrolling, clicking, and typing.
In this paper, we propose BrowserAgent, a more interactive agent that solves
complex tasks through human-inspired browser actions. BrowserAgent operates
directly on raw web pages via Playwright through a set of predefined browser
actions. We adopt a two-stage training (Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and
Rejection Fine-Tuning (RFT)) to improve the model's generalization abilities.
Despite using significantly less training data than Search-R1, BrowserAgent
achieves more competitive results across different Open-QA tasks. Additionally,
we introduce an explicit memory mechanism to store key conclusions across
steps, further enhancing the model's reasoning capabilities for long-horizon
tasks. Notably, BrowserAgent-7B can achieve around 20\% improvement over
Search-R1 on multi-hop QA tasks like HotpotQA, 2Wiki, and Bamboogle. These
results indicate that BrowserAgent can serve as a more advanced framework for
more interactive and scalable web agents.

*Zhuowei Chen,Bowei Zhang,Nankai Lin,Tian Hou,Lianxi Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ConsistentGuard, a multilingual safeguard for LLMs, enhances detection of malicious requests with reasoning and alignment techniques, outperforming larger models with limited training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current classifier-based LLM safeguards that lack interpretability and perform poorly on low-resource languages.

Method: Introduced ConsistentGuard, a reasoning-based and multilingual tool that uses alignment for improved language knowledge transfer and explainability.

Result: ConsistentGuard outperformed larger models on three datasets in six languages using only 1,000 training samples, showing strong generalization and interpretability.

Conclusion: ConsistentGuard enhances explainability and multilingual capability in LLM safeguards and represents a significant improvement over traditional methods, contributing resources for ongoing research.

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have enhanced AI capabilities, but also increased the
risk posed by malicious requests, highlighting the need for effective LLM
safeguards to detect such queries. Existing approaches largely rely on
classifier-based methods that lack interpretability and perform poorly on
low-resource languages. To address these limitations, we propose
ConsistentGuard, a novel reasoning-based multilingual safeguard, which enhances
explainability via reasoning and boosts knowledge transfer between languages
through alignment. With only 1,000 training samples, our method demonstrates
superior performance on three datasets across six languages, outperforming
larger models trained with significantly more data, and exhibits strong
interpretability and generalization ability. We also contribute a multilingual
benchmark extension and release our codes to support future research.

### [162] [RePro: Training Language Models to Faithfully Recycle the Web for Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10681)
*Zichun Yu,Chenyan Xiong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RePro introduces a novel method to recycle pretraining data for large language models, achieving high-quality rephrasings using reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the scarcity of high-quality pretraining data for large language models and seeks an efficient solution to this challenge.

Method: Researchers designed a 4B LM rephraser trained with reinforcement learning, using one quality reward and three faithfulness rewards to create effective and faithful rephrasings of data from DCLM-RefinedWeb.

Result: Pretraining with RePro data achieved 4.7%-14.0% relative accuracy improvement on 22 downstream tasks compared to organic baseline. It also outperformed ReWire and organic baselines with larger data pools.

Conclusion: RePro enhances pretraining data efficiency by 2-3x, preserves critical information better than existing methods, and offers an open-source solution to sustainably recycle LLM pretraining data.

Abstract: High-quality pretraining data is the fossil fuel of large language models
(LLMs), yet its reserves are running low for frontier models. In this paper, we
introduce RePro, a novel web recycling method that trains a relatively small LM
with reinforcement learning to generate effective and faithful rephrasings of
pretraining data. Specifically, we design one quality reward and three
faithfulness rewards, optimizing the LM rephraser to convert organic data into
high-quality rephrasings while maintaining its core semantics and structure. In
our experiment, we train a 4B rephraser to recycle 72B tokens sampled from
DCLM-RefinedWeb. Pretraining results on 400M and 1.4B models demonstrate that
RePro delivers 4.7%-14.0% relative accuracy gains over organic-only baseline on
22 downstream tasks. RePro also outperforms ReWire, the state-of-the-art web
recycling method that prompts a 70B rephraser, as well as the organic baseline
with a 4x larger data pool. Experiments with different amounts of recycled data
highlight that RePro improves organic data efficiency by 2-3x. Individual and
distributional analyses validate that RePro preserves more critical information
and faithfully reflects the characteristics of organic data compared to
prompting-based methods. Together, these results show that RePro provides an
efficient and controllable path to effectively harness the fossil fuel of LLM
pretraining. We open-source our code, rephraser, and recycled data at
https://github.com/cxcscmu/RePro.

### [163] [Sarcasm Detection Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks: A Modular Deep Learning Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10729)
*Manas Zambre,Sarika Bobade*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel modular deep learning framework for sarcasm detection using DCNNs and BERT to analyze various cues in text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting sarcasm in text is challenging due to the lack of tone and body language, which often leads to misinterpretation.

Method: The paper introduces a multi-layer framework combining DCNNs and contextual models like BERT to analyze sentiment, linguistic features, emotional cues, and contextual embeddings.

Result: While still conceptual, the framework shows promise for practical applications like improving chatbots and analyzing social media interactions.

Conclusion: The research highlights the potential of leveraging deep learning for nuanced sarcasm detection, paving the way for more accurate communication tools in digital interactions.

Abstract: Sarcasm is a nuanced and often misinterpreted form of communication,
especially in text, where tone and body language are absent. This paper
proposes a modular deep learning framework for sarcasm detection, leveraging
Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) and contextual models such as BERT
to analyze linguistic, emotional, and contextual cues. The system integrates
sentiment analysis, contextual embeddings, linguistic feature extraction, and
emotion detection through a multi-layer architecture. While the model is in the
conceptual stage, it demonstrates feasibility for real-world applications such
as chatbots and social media analysis.

### [164] [Large Language Models for Full-Text Methods Assessment: A Case Study on Mediation Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10762)
*Wenqing Zhang,Trang Nguyen,Elizabeth A. Stuart,Yiqun T. Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study evaluates large language models (LLMs) for automating methodological assessments in systematic reviews, focusing on causal mediation analysis. While LLMs perform well on straightforward criteria, their accuracy drops on complex assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Systematic reviews are critical for evidence synthesis in science but are labor-intensive when analyzing detailed methodologies. LLMs could potentially automate these tasks, improving efficiency and precision.

Method: The study benchmarked state-of-the-art LLMs against human experts by assessing 180 scientific articles for causal mediation analysis, comparing performance using metrics like accuracy and F1 correlations.

Result: LLMs achieved high accuracy (correlation 0.71; F1 correlation 0.97) on explicit criteria but showed reduced performance (up to 15% below human experts) on complex tasks requiring nuanced judgment. Errors were linked to language misunderstandings, and longer documents decreased accuracy.

Conclusion: LLMs are effective for identifying straightforward methodological features but need human oversight for complex reasoning. Combining automated extraction with expert review offers an efficient and rigorous way to perform systematic evidence synthesis.

Abstract: Systematic reviews are crucial for synthesizing scientific evidence but
remain labor-intensive, especially when extracting detailed methodological
information. Large language models (LLMs) offer potential for automating
methodological assessments, promising to transform evidence synthesis. Here,
using causal mediation analysis as a representative methodological domain, we
benchmarked state-of-the-art LLMs against expert human reviewers across 180
full-text scientific articles. Model performance closely correlated with human
judgments (accuracy correlation 0.71; F1 correlation 0.97), achieving
near-human accuracy on straightforward, explicitly stated methodological
criteria. However, accuracy sharply declined on complex, inference-intensive
assessments, lagging expert reviewers by up to 15%. Errors commonly resulted
from superficial linguistic cues -- for instance, models frequently
misinterpreted keywords like "longitudinal" or "sensitivity" as automatic
evidence of rigorous methodological approache, leading to systematic
misclassifications. Longer documents yielded lower model accuracy, whereas
publication year showed no significant effect. Our findings highlight an
important pattern for practitioners using LLMs for methods review and synthesis
from full texts: current LLMs excel at identifying explicit methodological
features but require human oversight for nuanced interpretations. Integrating
automated information extraction with targeted expert review thus provides a
promising approach to enhance efficiency and methodological rigor in evidence
synthesis across diverse scientific fields.

*James Ald Teves,Ray Daniel Cal,Josh Magdiel Villaluz,Jean Malolos,Mico Magtira,Ramon Rodriguez,Mideth Abisado,Joseph Marvin Imperial*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces HiligayNER, a Named Entity Recognition model for the Hiligaynon language, utilizing annotated corpora and achieving strong performance metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in natural language processing research for the underrepresented Hiligaynon language.

Method: Collected over 8,000 annotated sentences and fine-tuned Transformer-based models (mBERT and XLM-RoBERTa) for NER tasks.

Result: Models achieved precision, recall, and F1-score above 80%; demonstrated cross-lingual applicability with Cebuano and Tagalog.

Conclusion: HiligayNER contributes to NLP research for low-resource Philippine languages, fostering further development and application in regional language processing.

Abstract: The language of Hiligaynon, spoken predominantly by the people of Panay
Island, Negros Occidental, and Soccsksargen in the Philippines, remains
underrepresented in language processing research due to the absence of
annotated corpora and baseline models. This study introduces HiligayNER, the
first publicly available baseline model for the task of Named Entity
Recognition (NER) in Hiligaynon. The dataset used to build HiligayNER contains
over 8,000 annotated sentences collected from publicly available news articles,
social media posts, and literary texts. Two Transformer-based models, mBERT and
XLM-RoBERTa, were fine-tuned on this collected corpus to build versions of
HiligayNER. Evaluation results show strong performance, with both models
achieving over 80% in precision, recall, and F1-score across entity types.
Furthermore, cross-lingual evaluation with Cebuano and Tagalog demonstrates
promising transferability, suggesting the broader applicability of HiligayNER
for multilingual NLP in low-resource settings. This work aims to contribute to
language technology development for underrepresented Philippine languages,
specifically for Hiligaynon, and support future research in regional language
processing.

### [166] [Review of Inference-Time Scaling Strategies: Reasoning, Search and RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10787)
*Zhichao Wang,Cheng Wan,Dong Nie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Focuses on inference-time scaling for LLMs due to limitations in high-quality training data, categorizing a variety of techniques as Output-focused and Input-focused methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The availability of high-quality training data is diminishing, creating a bottleneck for further improving LLM performance via traditional scaling approaches. Thus, the paper explores inference-time techniques to overcome these challenges without retraining models.

Method: The paper systematically categorizes inference-time scaling techniques into Output-focused and Input-focused methodologies, detailing strategies like reasoning, search, multi-step generation, ensemble methods, few-shot learning, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

Result: Provides structured overviews of methods enhancing LLM inference-time performance, with a focus on diverse generation strategies and retrieval augmentation, offering a clearer understanding of the evolving techniques.

Conclusion: Inference-time scaling offers a promising avenue for advancing LLM performance amid high-quality data limitations, marking a pivot in research focus from training-centric approaches to deployment-centric strategies.

Abstract: The performance gains of LLMs have historically been driven by scaling up
model size and training data. However, the rapidly diminishing availability of
high-quality training data is introducing a fundamental bottleneck, shifting
the focus of research toward inference-time scaling. This paradigm uses
additional computation at the time of deployment to substantially improve LLM
performance on downstream tasks without costly model re-training. This review
systematically surveys the diverse techniques contributing to this new era of
inference-time scaling, organizing the rapidly evolving field into two
comprehensive perspectives: Output-focused and Input-focused methods.
Output-focused techniques encompass complex, multi-step generation strategies,
including reasoning (e.g., CoT, ToT, ReAct), various search and decoding
methods (e.g., MCTS, beam search), training for long CoT (e.g., RLVR, GRPO),
and model ensemble methods. Input-focused techniques are primarily categorized
by few-shot and RAG, with RAG as the central focus. The RAG section is further
detailed through a structured examination of query expansion, data, retrieval
and reranker, LLM generation methods, and multi-modal RAG.

### [167] [Toward Human-Centered Readability Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10801)
*Bahar İlgen,Georges Hattab*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Human-Centered Readability Score (HCRS) as a more comprehensive evaluation metric for health text simplification, emphasizing human-centered qualities like clarity and cultural relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current NLP evaluation metrics focus on surface-level features and are inadequate for high-stakes health communication, where qualities like trustworthiness, clarity, and usability are critical.

Method: The authors propose HCRS, a five-dimensional framework that combines automated metrics with structured human feedback. It integrates principles from HCI and health communication.

Result: The HCRS framework is outlined, its integration into participatory workflows is discussed, and a protocol for empirical validation is presented.

Conclusion: HCRS aims to improve health text simplification evaluations by capturing human-centered and contextual aspects, making NLP systems more aligned with diverse populations' needs.

Abstract: Text simplification is essential for making public health information
accessible to diverse populations, including those with limited health
literacy. However, commonly used evaluation metrics in Natural Language
Processing (NLP), such as BLEU, FKGL, and SARI, mainly capture surface-level
features and fail to account for human-centered qualities like clarity,
trustworthiness, tone, cultural relevance, and actionability. This limitation
is particularly critical in high-stakes health contexts, where communication
must be not only simple but also usable, respectful, and trustworthy. To
address this gap, we propose the Human-Centered Readability Score (HCRS), a
five-dimensional evaluation framework grounded in Human-Computer Interaction
(HCI) and health communication research. HCRS integrates automatic measures
with structured human feedback to capture the relational and contextual aspects
of readability. We outline the framework, discuss its integration into
participatory evaluation workflows, and present a protocol for empirical
validation. This work aims to advance the evaluation of health text
simplification beyond surface metrics, enabling NLP systems that align more
closely with diverse users' needs, expectations, and lived experiences.

### [168] [Is Implicit Knowledge Enough for LLMs? A RAG Approach for Tree-based Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10806)
*Mihir Gupte,Paolo Giusto,Ramesh S*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method for improving Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by representing hierarchical data (e.g., GitHub repositories) more efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate methods to better represent hierarchical, structured data for knowledge retrieval and response generation, addressing limitations in RAG when handling such data.

Method: Proposes a novel bottom-up linearization of hierarchical knowledge, creating aggregated summaries at each level, which are stored in a knowledge base for retrieval and use in RAG.

Result: The proposed method maintained comparable response quality to RAG on raw, unstructured data but achieved over 68% fewer retrieved documents, significantly improving efficiency.

Conclusion: Implicit, linearized representations of hierarchical data can be an efficient and scalable approach for RAG applications, maintaining quality while reducing retrieval overhead.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are adept at generating responses based on
information within their context. While this ability is useful for interacting
with structured data like code files, another popular method,
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), retrieves relevant documents to augment
the model's in-context learning. However, it is not well-explored how to best
represent this retrieved knowledge for generating responses on structured data,
particularly hierarchical structures like trees. In this work, we propose a
novel bottom-up method to linearize knowledge from tree-like structures (like a
GitHub repository) by generating implicit, aggregated summaries at each
hierarchical level. This approach enables the knowledge to be stored in a
knowledge base and used directly with RAG. We then compare our method to using
RAG on raw, unstructured code, evaluating the accuracy and quality of the
generated responses. Our results show that while response quality is comparable
across both methods, our approach generates over 68% fewer documents in the
retriever, a significant gain in efficiency. This finding suggests that
leveraging implicit, linearized knowledge may be a highly effective and
scalable strategy for handling complex, hierarchical data structures.

*Haeji Jung,Jinju Kim,Kyungjin Kim,Youjeong Roh,David R. Mortensen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores the role of transliteration in enhancing multilingual NLP tasks for non-Latin scripts, emphasizing romanization's superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how shared script, token vocabularies, and phonology influence multilingual NLP model performance.

Method: Controlled experiments using transliteration techniques (romanization, phonemic transcription, substitution ciphers) alongside orthography, evaluated on NER and NLI tasks.

Result: Romanization outperformed all other methods in 7 out of 8 cases. Longer shared tokens with pre-trained languages improved the model's utility.

Conclusion: Romanization is the most effective transliteration method due to shared token advantages, facilitating better model performance in multilingual NLP.

Abstract: Transliteration has emerged as a promising means to bridge the gap between
various languages in multilingual NLP, showing promising results especially for
languages using non-Latin scripts. We investigate the degree to which shared
script, overlapping token vocabularies, and shared phonology contribute to
performance of multilingual models. To this end, we conduct controlled
experiments using three kinds of transliteration (romanization, phonemic
transcription, and substitution ciphers) as well as orthography. We evaluate
each model on two downstream tasks -- named entity recognition (NER) and
natural language inference (NLI) -- and find that romanization significantly
outperforms other input types in 7 out of 8 evaluation settings, largely
consistent with our hypothesis that it is the most effective approach. We
further analyze how each factor contributed to the success, and suggest that
having longer (subword) tokens shared with pre-trained languages leads to
better utilization of the model.

### [170] [DUAL-Bench: Measuring Over-Refusal and Robustness in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10846)
*Kaixuan Ren,Preslav Nakov,Usman Naseem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DUAL-Bench, a benchmark for assessing over-refusal and safe completion behaviors in vision-language models (VLMs), revealing their limitations in safety and usefulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of achieving a balance between safety and usefulness in vision-language models, particularly in scenarios involving benign requests that may include harmful visual content.

Method: Developed DUAL-Bench, a multimodal benchmark that evaluates 18 VLMs across 12 hazard categories, focusing on their ability to handle semantics-preserving visual perturbations and enable safe completions.

Result: Evaluation showed that GPT-5-Nano achieved 12.9% safe completion, GPT-5 models averaged 7.9%, and Qwen models scored 3.9%, indicating substantial room for improvement.

Conclusion: DUAL-Bench highlights the need for nuanced alignment strategies to improve VLMs' capability to balance safety and usefulness in complex multimodal scenarios.

Abstract: As vision-language models become increasingly capable, maintaining a balance
between safety and usefulness remains a central challenge. Safety mechanisms,
while essential, can backfire, causing over-refusal, where models decline
benign requests out of excessive caution. Yet, no existing benchmark has
systematically addressed over-refusal in the visual modality. This setting
introduces unique challenges, such as dual-use cases where an instruction is
harmless, but the accompanying image contains harmful content. Models
frequently fail in such scenarios, either refusing too conservatively or
completing tasks unsafely, which highlights the need for more fine-grained
alignment. The ideal behavior is safe completion, i.e., fulfilling the benign
parts of a request while explicitly warning about any potentially harmful
elements. To address this, we present DUAL-Bench, the first multimodal
benchmark focused on over-refusal and safe completion in VLMs. We evaluated 18
VLMs across 12 hazard categories, with focus on their robustness under
semantics-preserving visual perturbations. The results reveal substantial room
for improvement: GPT-5-Nano achieves 12.9% safe completion, GPT-5 models
average 7.9%, and Qwen models only 3.9%. We hope that DUAL-Bench will foster
the development of more nuanced alignment strategies that ensure models remain
both safe and useful in complex multimodal settings.

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks six test-time strategies and four large language models (LLMs) for Text-to-SQL tasks, focusing on real-world applications and performance trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the practical applicability, effectiveness, and trade-offs of lightweight, scalable strategies for LLM-driven Text-to-SQL systems in industrial settings.

Method: Benchmarking six test-time scaling strategies and four LLMs (including reasoning models) using the BIRD Mini-Dev benchmark, while analyzing performance, inference latency, and token consumption.

Result: Divide-and-Conquer prompting and few-shot demonstrations improve performance across general-purpose and reasoning-focused LLMs, but the inclusion of extra workflow steps shows inconsistent benefits.

Conclusion: The study highlights trade-offs between accuracy, efficiency, and complexity in deploying Text2SQL systems, emphasizing the importance of model and strategy selection.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly powering Text-to-SQL (Text2SQL)
systems, enabling non-expert users to query industrial databases using natural
language. While test-time scaling strategies have shown promise in LLM-based
solutions, their effectiveness in real-world applications, especially with the
latest reasoning models, remains uncertain. In this work, we benchmark six
lightweight, industry-oriented test-time scaling strategies and four LLMs,
including two reasoning models, evaluating their performance on the BIRD
Mini-Dev benchmark. Beyond standard accuracy metrics, we also report inference
latency and token consumption, providing insights relevant for practical system
deployment. Our findings reveal that Divide-and-Conquer prompting and few-shot
demonstrations consistently enhance performance for both general-purpose and
reasoning-focused LLMs. However, introducing additional workflow steps yields
mixed results, and base model selection plays a critical role. This work sheds
light on the practical trade-offs between accuracy, efficiency, and complexity
when deploying Text2SQL systems.

TL;DR: LLM x MapReduce-V3 enhances long-form survey generation with a modular, multi-agent architecture that allows dynamic planning and human customization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to improve long-form survey generation by incorporating modularity and dynamism in agent system architectures.

Method: The paper introduces MCP-based independent servers for specific tasks (e.g., digest construction) and aggregates them hierarchically. A planner agent dynamically selects modules to shape workflows.

Result: The system outperforms baseline methods in human evaluations regarding depth and length of generated surveys.

Conclusion: Hierarchical modular planning using MCP servers enhances survey generation, allowing user customization and dynamic orchestration.

Abstract: We introduce LLM x MapReduce-V3, a hierarchically modular agent system
designed for long-form survey generation. Building on the prior work, LLM x
MapReduce-V2, this version incorporates a multi-agent architecture where
individual functional components, such as skeleton initialization, digest
construction, and skeleton refinement, are implemented as independent
model-context-protocol (MCP) servers. These atomic servers can be aggregated
into higher-level servers, creating a hierarchically structured system. A
high-level planner agent dynamically orchestrates the workflow by selecting
appropriate modules based on their MCP tool descriptions and the execution
history. This modular decomposition facilitates human-in-the-loop intervention,
affording users greater control and customization over the research process.
Through a multi-turn interaction, the system precisely captures the intended
research perspectives to generate a comprehensive skeleton, which is then
developed into an in-depth survey. Human evaluations demonstrate that our
system surpasses representative baselines in both content depth and length,
highlighting the strength of MCP-based modular planning.

TL;DR: The study identifies overconfidence in large language models' verbalized confidence and introduces ADVICE, a fine-tuning framework that improves calibration by grounding confidence on the model's answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the issue of overconfidence in LLMs and explores the origins of this behavior for better transparency and trustworthiness in natural language interfaces.

Method: The authors developed ADVICE, a fine-tuning framework, to enable answer-dependent confidence estimation in LLMs and conducted extensive experiments to evaluate its effectiveness.

Result: The ADVICE framework improves confidence calibration while maintaining task performance and enhances the answer-dependent nature of verbalized confidence.

Conclusion: ADVICE addresses the answer-independence problem, leading to better-calibrated confidence distributions and improving the reliability of confidence verbalization in LLMs.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has enabled them to express
their confidence in natural language, enhancing transparency and reliability.
However, their confidence often exhibits overconfidence, the cause of which
remains poorly understood. In this work, we conduct a detailed analysis of the
dynamics underlying verbalized confidence and identify answer-independence as a
key factor, defined as the model's failure to condition confidence on its own
answer. To address this, we propose ADVICE (Answer-Dependent Verbalized
Confidence Estimation), a fine-tuning framework that facilitates
answer-grounded confidence estimation. Extensive experiments show that ADVICE
substantially improves confidence calibration while preserving task
performance. Further analyses confirm that ADVICE strengthens
answer-groundedness, leading to more balanced and well-calibrated confidence
distributions. Our findings shed light on the origin of overconfidence and
establish a framework for more trustworthy confidence verbalization.

*Yawen Yang,Fukun Ma,Shiao Meng,Aiwei Liu,Lijie Wen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces GapDNER, a model leveraging context gaps for improved recognition of discontinuous entities in Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for discontinuous NER face decoding ambiguity and error propagation due to varied span combinations, necessitating improved modeling approaches.

Method: GapDNER uses representation learning on context gaps, token-pair grid tagging, and key modules like biaffine attention for intra-span regularity and criss-cross attention for inter-span relations.

Result: GapDNER achieved state-of-the-art results on three datasets, showcasing superior performance in detecting complex entity structures.

Conclusion: GapDNER efficiently enhances discontinuous NER capabilities through innovative gap-aware mechanisms, paving the way for handling intricate biomedical entities.

Abstract: In biomedical fields, one named entity may consist of a series of
non-adjacent tokens and overlap with other entities. Previous methods recognize
discontinuous entities by connecting entity fragments or internal tokens, which
face challenges of error propagation and decoding ambiguity due to the wide
variety of span or word combinations. To address these issues, we deeply
explore discontinuous entity structures and propose an effective Gap-aware grid
tagging model for Discontinuous Named Entity Recognition, named GapDNER. Our
GapDNER innovatively applies representation learning on the context gaps
between entity fragments to resolve decoding ambiguity and enhance
discontinuous NER performance. Specifically, we treat the context gap as an
additional type of span and convert span classification into a token-pair grid
tagging task. Subsequently, we design two interactive components to
comprehensively model token-pair grid features from both intra- and inter-span
perspectives. The intra-span regularity extraction module employs the biaffine
mechanism along with linear attention to capture the internal regularity of
each span, while the inter-span relation enhancement module utilizes
criss-cross attention to obtain semantic relations among different spans. At
the inference stage of entity decoding, we assign a directed edge to each
entity fragment and context gap, then use the BFS algorithm to search for all
valid paths from the head to tail of grids with entity tags. Experimental
results on three datasets demonstrate that our GapDNER achieves new
state-of-the-art performance on discontinuous NER and exhibits remarkable
advantages in recognizing complex entity structures.

*Katherine M. Collins,Cedegao E. Zhang,Graham Todd,Lance Ying,Mauricio Barba da Costa,Ryan Liu,Prafull Sharma,Adrian Weller,Ionatan Kuperwajs,Lionel Wong,Joshua B. Tenenbaum,Thomas L. Griffiths*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new paradigm for evaluating AI systems based on their ability to assess games (their payoff and funness), showing reasoning models align better with human judgments but exhibit unpredictable resource usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore AI's capability beyond problem-solving, focusing on its ability to evaluate the worthiness of problems, especially in the context of games.

Method: Introduced a formal framework for evaluation, analyzed large datasets of board games using modern reasoning models, and compared their evaluations to human and symbolic computational agents.

Result: Reasoning models align better with human evaluations than non-reasoning models, but as they approach game-theoretic optimality, their alignment weakens. Difficulty in assessing subjective aspects like funness leads to variability.

Conclusion: AI evaluation models require more resource-rational meta-reasoning to improve assessment consistency, especially in subjective and complex queries.

Abstract: Reasoning is not just about solving problems -- it is also about evaluating
which problems are worth solving at all. Evaluations of artificial intelligence
(AI) systems primarily focused on problem solving, historically by studying how
models play games such as chess and Go. In this paper, we advocate for a new
paradigm that assesses AI systems' evaluation of games. First, we introduce a
formalism for evaluating such evaluations. We then leverage a large-scale
dataset of over $100$ novel board games and over 450 human judgments to compare
evaluations produced by modern language and reasoning models against those of
people and symbolic computational agents. We consider two kinds of evaluative
queries: assessing the payoff (or fairness) and the funness of games. These
queries span two dimensions relevant to the design of evaluations of AI
evaluations: how complex a query is to compute and how difficult a query is to
quantify. Our results show that reasoning models are generally more aligned to
people in their evaluations of games than non-reasoning language models.
However, we observe a non-monotonic relationship: as models get closer to
game-theoretic optimal, their fit to human data weakens. We also observe more
"jaggedness" across models for assessing funness, in line with the greater
difficulty of quantifying this query. Across queries and games, reasoning
models show highly variable and unpredictable resource usage when assessing
queries, pointing to the importance of imbuing more resource-rational
meta-reasoning in language and reasoning models.

*Anirudh Ganesh,Jayavardhan Reddy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study replicates Ma and Hovy's BiLSTM-CNN-CRF architecture for sequence labeling, confirming its strong performance and releasing a PyTorch implementation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To validate the performance and reproducibility of the BiLSTM-CNN-CRF model for sequence labeling tasks and make it accessible for further research.

Method: Reimplement and analyze the BiLSTM-CNN-CRF model components using PyTorch, testing it on NER and POS tagging tasks.

Result: Achieved 91.18% F1-score on CoNLL-2003 NER and confirmed the model's effectiveness across sequence labeling tasks.

Conclusion: The BiLSTM-CNN-CRF model's architecture is robust and performs well without hand-crafted features; the PyTorch implementation supports future explorations.

Abstract: We present a reproducibility study of the state-of-the-art neural
architecture for sequence labeling proposed by Ma and Hovy
(2016)\cite{ma2016end}. The original BiLSTM-CNN-CRF model combines
character-level representations via Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs),
word-level context modeling through Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory
networks (BiLSTMs), and structured prediction using Conditional Random Fields
(CRFs). This end-to-end approach eliminates the need for hand-crafted features
while achieving excellent performance on named entity recognition (NER) and
part-of-speech (POS) tagging tasks. Our implementation successfully reproduces
the key results, achieving 91.18\% F1-score on CoNLL-2003 NER and demonstrating
the model's effectiveness across sequence labeling tasks. We provide a detailed
analysis of the architecture components and release an open-source PyTorch
implementation to facilitate further research.

*Eitan Klinger,Vivaan Wadhwa,Jungyeul Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a resource and evaluation setup for improving treebank binarization by preserving punctuation during the process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard binarization pipelines remove punctuation, which negatively affects the structure and accuracy of head-child relationships.

Method: The paper introduces a reproducible punctuation-preserving pipeline, derived artifacts, and an evaluation suite to assess various aspects of processing.

Result: Punctuation-aware binarization boosts head prediction accuracy in the Penn Treebank and is competitive with other derivational resources.

Conclusion: The proposed approach improves linguistic accuracy in syntactic parsing, with all materials made available for further research.

Abstract: This article presents a curated resource and evaluation suite for
punctuation-aware treebank binarization. Standard binarization pipelines drop
punctuation before head selection, which alters constituent shape and harms
head-child identification. We release (1) a reproducible pipeline that
preserves punctuation as sibling nodes prior to binarization, (2) derived
artifacts and metadata (intermediate @X markers, reversibility signatures,
alignment indices), and (3) an accompanying evaluation suite covering
head-child prediction, round-trip reversibility, and structural compatibility
with derivational resources (CCGbank). On the Penn Treebank, punctuation-aware
preprocessing improves head prediction accuracy from 73.66\% (Collins rules)
and 86.66\% (MLP) to 91.85\% with the same classifier, and achieves competitive
alignment against CCGbank derivations. All code, configuration files, and
documentation are released to enable replication and extension to other
corpora.

*Yejin Lee,Su-Hyeon Kim,Hyundong Jin,Dayoung Kim,Yeonsoo Kim,Yo-Sub Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces KOTOX, a Korean toxic dataset designed for deobfuscation and detoxification, aiming to address gaps in low-resource language toxic content handling by LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the issue of toxic content in low-resource languages, where LLMs have limited ability to detect and neutralize obfuscated toxic communication.

Method: The method involves categorizing Korean obfuscation approaches, defining transformation rules based on real-world examples, and creating three datasets (easy, normal, hard) with varying obfuscation levels.

Result: The result is the creation of the first Korean dataset supporting both deobfuscation and detoxification, enabling improved LLM performance for detecting and mitigating obfuscated toxic content.

Conclusion: KOTOX provides a pioneering resource for combating obfuscated toxic content in Korean and other low-resource languages, fostering advancements in LLM-based toxicity detection and resolution.

Abstract: Toxic content has become an increasingly critical social issue with the rapid
expansion of online communication. While numerous studies explored methods for
detecting and detoxifying such content, most have focused primarily on English,
leaving low-resource language underrepresented. Consequently, Large Language
Models~(LLMs) often struggle to identify and neutralize toxic expressions in
these languages. This challenge becomes even more pronounced when user employ
obfuscation techniques to evade detection systems. Therefore, we propose a
\textbf{KOTOX: Korean Toxic Dataset} for deobfuscation and detoxicification to
address this issue. We categorize various obfuscation approaches based on
linguistic characteristics of Korean and define a set of transformation rules
grounded in real-word examples. Using these rules, we construct three dataset
versions (easy, normal, and hard) representing different levels of obfuscation
difficulty. This is the first dataset that simultaneously supports
deobfuscation and detoxification for the Korean language. We expect it to
facilitate better understanding and mitigating of obfuscated toxic content in
LLM for low-resource languages. Our code and data are available at
https://github.com/leeyejin1231/KOTOX.

*Jidong Li,Lingyong Fang,Haodong Zhao,Sufeng Duan,Gongshen Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study introduces a new dataset and framework to improve multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in recognizing false premises, showing significant improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with identifying false premises due to the limitations of current evaluation benchmarks.

Method: A new fully automated pipeline categorizes false premises into 3 types and 13 subtypes. The resulting dataset, JBA, is used alongside a recognition enhancement framework to improve MLLMs.

Result: Experiments show that the models trained with this framework perform significantly better in detecting false premises.

Conclusion: The study fills a critical gap in evaluating and improving MLLMs' ability to identify false premises, with promising results.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have witnessed astonishing
advancements in recent years. Despite these successes, MLLMs remain vulnerable
to flase premise problems. However, existing benchmarks targeting this issue
are limited in scope: they often lack fine-grained categorization, exhibit
insufficient coverage, and thus fail to provide a rigorous evaluation of the
ability of models to recognize false premises. To bridge this gap, we introduce
a fully automated pipeline for constructing a comprehensive benchmark of false
premise questions. Our method systematically categorizes the premises into
three main types and thirteen subtypes according to the abilities required to
identify the premises, resulting in the JBA dataset.Results show current MLLMs
still struggle with false premise recognition. Building upon this benchmark, we
further propose a recognition enhancement framework tailored to strengthen the
robustness of MLLMs to detect false premises. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that models trained with our framework achieve significant improvements in
false premise recognition.

### [180] [RV-HATE: Reinforced Multi-Module Voting for Implicit Hate Speech Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10971)
*Yejin Lee,Hyeseon Ahn,Yo-Sub Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RV-HATE is a new hate speech detection framework that adapts to the dataset-specific features using reinforcement learning for enhanced accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenges posed by diverse hate speech datasets, which differ due to their sources, linguistic styles, and social contexts, making traditional one-size-fits-all detection methods inadequate.

Method: RV-HATE employs multiple modules, each focusing on specific linguistic or contextual features of hate speech, and uses reinforcement learning to optimize module weights for each dataset. A voting mechanism aggregates module outputs for final detection.

Result: RV-HATE outperforms traditional static methods by effectively addressing implicit hate speech and improving detection accuracy across diverse datasets while providing insights into dataset-specific features.

Conclusion: The framework tailors hate speech detection to the unique characteristics of datasets, offering both enhanced performance and interpretability, and serves as a robust solution for evolving hate speech detection challenges.

Abstract: Hate speech remains prevalent in human society and continues to evolve in its
forms and expressions. Modern advancements in internet and online anonymity
accelerate its rapid spread and complicate its detection. However, hate speech
datasets exhibit diverse characteristics primarily because they are constructed
from different sources and platforms, each reflecting different linguistic
styles and social contexts. Despite this diversity, prior studies on hate
speech detection often rely on fixed methodologies without adapting to
data-specific features. We introduce RV-HATE, a detection framework designed to
account for the dataset-specific characteristics of each hate speech dataset.
RV-HATE consists of multiple specialized modules, where each module focuses on
distinct linguistic or contextual features of hate speech. The framework
employs reinforcement learning to optimize weights that determine the
contribution of each module for a given dataset. A voting mechanism then
aggregates the module outputs to produce the final decision. RV-HATE offers two
primary advantages: (1)~it improves detection accuracy by tailoring the
detection process to dataset-specific attributes, and (2)~it also provides
interpretable insights into the distinctive features of each dataset.
Consequently, our approach effectively addresses implicit hate speech and
achieves superior performance compared to conventional static methods. Our code
is available at https://github.com/leeyejin1231/RV-HATE.

### [181] [Enhancing Large Language Model Reasoning via Selective Critical Token Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10974)
*Zhiwen Ruan,Yixia Li,He Zhu,Yun Chen,Peng Li,Yang Liu,Guanhua Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Critical Token Fine-tuning (CFT), a method that fine-tunes only essential tokens identified by counterfactual analysis, improving reasoning accuracy and diversity in large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which uniformly penalizes all tokens and compromises generalization and output diversity.

Method: CFT selectively updates only critical tokens deemed indispensable via counterfactual perturbations, focusing gradient updates on these crucial reasoning steps while preserving diversity in non-critical tokens.

Result: Experiments across multiple models and benchmarks show that CFT, fine-tuning less than 12% of tokens, outperforms standard SFT in reasoning tasks, supports test-time scaling, and provides a better starting point for reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: CFT is a practical and general approach for enhancing the efficiency and robustness of fine-tuning in large language models, improving reasoning and diversity while reducing computational resources.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
as a key method to adapt pre-trained models to domain-specific tasks such as
mathematical reasoning. However, standard SFT uniformly penalizes all tokens,
neglecting that only a small subset of critical tokens determines reasoning
correctness. This uniform supervision often causes reduced output diversity and
limited generalization. We propose Critical Token Fine-tuning (CFT), a simple
yet effective approach that updates only tokens identified as functionally
indispensable via counterfactual perturbations. By focusing gradient signals on
these decisive reasoning steps while preserving the diversity of non-critical
tokens, CFT can enhance both generation and diversity. Extensive experiments on
five models across three families (Qwen, OLMo, LLaMA) and eleven mathematical
reasoning benchmarks show that CFT, despite fine-tuning on less than 12% of
tokens, consistently outperforms standard SFT. Moreover, CFT enables test-time
scaling through improved sampling diversity and provides a stronger
initialization for reinforcement learning, sustaining performance gains in
later training stages while maintaining higher entropy for better exploration.
These results highlight CFT as a practical and general framework for efficient
and robust LLM fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces DEEPRESEARCHGUARD, a framework to address deficiencies in evaluating deep research reports by incorporating stage-wise safeguards and introducing a new safety benchmark, DRSAFEBENCH.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of sufficient evaluation procedures and safety mechanisms in existing deep research frameworks, which fail to assess report quality dimensions like credibility and coherence, and may integrate unsafe sources.

Method: The proposed framework, DEEPRESEARCHGUARD, employs four-stage safeguards and open-domain evaluation methods, and evaluates performance using metrics such as defense success rate and over-refusal rate. They also introduce DRSAFEBENCH to benchmark safety.

Result: DEEPRESEARCHGUARD achieves an 18.16% improvement in defense success rates and reduces over-refusal rates by 6%. It enhances early-stage protection, citation discipline, and source credibility through its structured safeguards.

Conclusion: DEEPRESEARCHGUARD provides effective stage-specific defenses and evaluation measures, significantly improving report quality and preventing harmful content propagation without excessive over-refusal.

Abstract: Deep research frameworks have shown promising capabilities in synthesizing
comprehensive reports from web sources. While deep research possesses
significant potential to address complex issues through planning and research
cycles, existing frameworks are deficient in sufficient evaluation procedures
and stage-specific protections. They typically treat evaluation as exact match
accuracy of question-answering, but overlook crucial aspects of report quality
such as credibility, coherence, breadth, depth, and safety. This oversight may
result in hazardous or malicious sources being integrated into the final
report. To address these issues, we introduce DEEPRESEARCHGUARD, a
comprehensive framework featuring four-stage safeguards with open-domain
evaluation of references and reports. We assess performance across multiple
metrics, e.g., defense success rate and over-refusal rate, and five key report
dimensions. In the absence of a suitable safety benchmark, we introduce
DRSAFEBENCH, a stage-wise benchmark for deep research safety. Our evaluation
spans diverse state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-flash,
DeepSeek-v3, and o4-mini. DEEPRESEARCHGUARD achieves an average defense success
rate improvement of 18.16% while reducing over-refusal rate by 6%. The input
guard provides the most substantial early-stage protection by filtering out
obvious risks, while the plan and research guards enhance citation discipline
and source credibility. Through extensive experiments, we show that
DEEPRESEARCHGUARD enables comprehensive open-domain evaluation and stage-aware
defenses that effectively block harmful content propagation, while
systematically improving report quality without excessive over-refusal rates.

*Mahika Phutane,Hayoung Jung,Matthew Kim,Tanushree Mitra,Aditya Vashistha*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper audits six large language models (LLMs) across hiring scenarios to analyze biases against people with disabilities (PwD) and introduces metrics to evaluate ableism-specific and intersectional harms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research primarily focuses on Western-centric perspectives and neglects the intersectional challenges faced by PwD, particularly in the Global South.

Method: The authors audited six LLMs across 2,820 hiring scenarios with diverse profiles, using ABLEIST metrics derived from disability studies literature to measure ableism-specific and intersectional harms.

Result: The analysis exposed significant biases and harms against PwD, including amplified intersectional harms for marginalized genders and castes, which were undetected by current safety tools.

Conclusion: Current safety evaluation tools for LLMs need improvement to incorporate intersectional safety measures, especially in critical domains like hiring.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly under scrutiny for perpetuating
identity-based discrimination in high-stakes domains such as hiring,
particularly against people with disabilities (PwD). However, existing research
remains largely Western-centric, overlooking how intersecting forms of
marginalization--such as gender and caste--shape experiences of PwD in the
Global South. We conduct a comprehensive audit of six LLMs across 2,820 hiring
scenarios spanning diverse disability, gender, nationality, and caste profiles.
To capture subtle intersectional harms and biases, we introduce ABLEIST
(Ableism, Inspiration, Superhumanization, and Tokenism), a set of five
ableism-specific and three intersectional harm metrics grounded in disability
studies literature. Our results reveal significant increases in ABLEIST harms
towards disabled candidates--harms that many state-of-the-art models failed to
detect. These harms were further amplified by sharp increases in intersectional
harms (e.g., Tokenism) for gender and caste-marginalized disabled candidates,
highlighting critical blind spots in current safety tools and the need for
intersectional safety evaluations of frontier models in high-stakes domains
like hiring.

### [184] [DND: Boosting Large Language Models with Dynamic Nested Depth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11001)
*Tieyuan Chen,Xiaodong Chen,Haoxing Chen,Zhenzhong Lan,Weiyao Lin,Jianguo Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dynamic Nested Depth (DND), a method to improve LLMs by reprocessing critical tokens in a targeted way, resulting in better performance with minimal additional resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs often treat all tokens uniformly during processing, which can be computationally inefficient and fail to adaptively focus on more difficult tokens.

Method: DND dynamically selects critical tokens at the end of each layer using a router, reprocessing only these tokens. It employs a router-controlling loss for better token selection and a threshold control scheme for stability.

Result: The approach enhanced the performance of pre-trained models like Qwen3-1.7B (+1.88%) and Qwen3-30B-A3B (+0.87%) across benchmarks, with minimal extra parameters and computation.

Conclusion: DND provides an efficient way to enhance pre-trained LLMs' capabilities by selectively reprocessing critical tokens, demonstrating its value in improving performance without significant overhead.

Abstract: We introduce Dynamic Nested Depth (DND), a novel method that improves
performance for off-the-shelf LLMs by selecting critical tokens to reprocess in
a nested depth manner. Specifically, at the end of the given transformer layer,
DND identifies more critical tokens with a router and feeds them back for an
extra round of processing, effectively ``reviewing" difficult tokens while
avoiding redundant computation for easier ones. The dynamic selection mechanism
is tailored for precise control via two novel strategies: a router controlling
loss to enhance token selection distinguishability, and a threshold control
scheme to ensure selection stability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DND
by directly integrating it into pre-trained dense and MoE models during a
post-training phase. On diverse benchmarks, this approach boosts the
performances of the dense Qwen3-1.7B by 1.88% and the MoE Qwen3-30B-A3B by
0.87%, all with a minimal parameter and computing increase.

TL;DR: LogiNumSynth is a problem synthesizer for evaluating and improving LLMs’ logical and numerical reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets are limited in their ability to control task complexities and generalizability for evaluating language models’ logical-numerical reasoning.

Method: The authors developed LogiNumSynth, a synthesizer allowing fine-grained control over task complexity in logical and numerical reasoning, facilitating targeted data creation.

Result: Experiments showed persistent weaknesses in logical-numerical reasoning in LLMs and demonstrated the utility of LogiNumSynth for diagnosis and skill enhancement.

Conclusion: LogiNumSynth is a valuable tool for both diagnosing deficiencies and improving the logical-numerical reasoning abilities of large language models.

Abstract: Joint logical-numerical reasoning remains a major challenge for language
models, yet existing datasets rely on fixed rule sets and offer limited control
over task complexity, constraining their generalizability for evaluation and
training. We present LogiNumSynth, a flexible natural language problem
synthesizer that synthesizes tasks requiring proficiency in joint logical
reasoning (e.g., rule-based reasoning) and numerical reasoning (e.g.,
arithmetic computation). LogiNumSynth supports fine-grained control over
reasoning world richness, logical reasoning depth, and the complexity of
numerical computations, enabling flexible data synthesis across difficulty
levels. We demonstrate three key contributions: (1) Synthesizer -- synthesizing
fully controllable joint reasoning tasks over natural language; (2) Evaluation
& Process Analysis -- evaluating both process accuracy and answer accuracy; (3)
Targeted Training -- using synthesized data to enhance LLMs' reasoning
performance. Experiments with multiple LLMs highlight persistent weaknesses in
logical-numerical reasoning, showing that LogiNumSynth can serve as both a
diagnostic tool and a source of targeted supervision for advancing integrated
reasoning skills.

*Wenya Xie,Qingying Xiao,Yu Zheng,Xidong Wang,Junying Chen,Ke Ji,Anningzhe Gao,Prayag Tiwari,Xiang Wan,Feng Jiang,Benyou Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper discusses the use of large language models (LLMs) in healthcare, proposing a shift from patient-facing roles to acting as clinical assistants for physicians. It develops a Chinese medical dataset, DoctorFLAN, to improve LLMs for such tasks, and evaluates their use in physician workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models have shown promise in healthcare but pose risks when directly interacting with patients due to a lack of specialized domain knowledge. There is a need to refocus these models as tools designed to assist physicians rather than patients.

Method: The authors conducted a two-stage survey to understand clinical workflow needs. Based on this, they created DoctorFLAN, a 92,000-instance dataset covering 22 clinical tasks and 27 specialties. They also designed two evaluation benchmarks to assess LLMs for doctor-facing tasks.

Result: Experimental results show that DoctorFLAN enhances the medical task performance of open-source LLMs, aligning them better with physician requirements and complementing patient-oriented models.

Conclusion: DoctorFLAN represents an important step toward developing large language models optimized for medical professionals, with the potential to integrate these models smoothly into clinical workflows.

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has transformed healthcare by
offering clinical guidance, yet their direct deployment to patients poses
safety risks due to limited domain expertise. To mitigate this, we propose
repositioning LLMs as clinical assistants that collaborate with experienced
physicians rather than interacting with patients directly. We conduct a
two-stage inspiration-feedback survey to identify real-world needs in clinical
workflows. Guided by this, we construct DoctorFLAN, a large-scale Chinese
medical dataset comprising 92,000 Q&A instances across 22 clinical tasks and 27
specialties. To evaluate model performance in doctor-facing applications, we
introduce DoctorFLAN-test (550 single-turn Q&A items) and DotaBench (74
multi-turn conversations). Experimental results with over ten popular LLMs
demonstrate that DoctorFLAN notably improves the performance of open-source
LLMs in medical contexts, facilitating their alignment with physician workflows
and complementing existing patient-oriented models. This work contributes a
valuable resource and framework for advancing doctor-centered medical LLM
development

*Qinglin Zhu,Yizhen Yao,Runcong Zhao,Yanzheng Xiang,Amrutha Saseendran,Chen Jin,Philip Alexander Teare,Bin Liang,Yulan He,Lin Gui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents Latent Refinement Decoding (LRD) for faster and more accurate natural language generation, addressing limitations of recent parallel generation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models are the standard for natural language generation but suffer from high latency due to sequential decoding. The paper seeks to address this alongside shortcomings in recent parallel generation approaches regarding information loss and premature commitment.

Method: The proposed LRD framework consists of two stages: Latent Refinement, which ensures global consistency by retaining masked tokens as mixtures, and a Predictive Feedback Loop, which iteratively finalizes confident tokens while retaining uncertain ones. KL-divergence dynamics guide convergence and early stopping.

Result: Experiments demonstrate improved accuracy in coding and reasoning benchmarks (e.g., HumanEval +6.3, GSM8K +2.9) along with speedups of up to 10.6x.

Conclusion: LRD is a robust alternative for parallel sequence generation with both enhanced accuracy and efficiency, overcoming key limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models remain the standard for natural language
generation but still suffer from high latency due to strictly sequential
decoding. Recent diffusion-inspired approaches, such as LlaDA and Dream,
mitigate this by generating in parallel, yet they suffer from two core
limitations: information loss, as predictive distributions for non-finalized
tokens are discarded at each step, and premature commitment, where local
decisions are made without sufficient global coordination. We introduce Latent
Refinement Decoding (LRD), a two-stage framework with Latent Refinement and a
Predictive Feedback Loop. The first stage maintains masked positions as
distributional mixtures of predicted tokens and the mask embedding, allowing
the model to establish more globally consistent beliefs. The second stage
progressively finalizes confident tokens while retaining uncertain ones for
iterative feedback. KL-divergence dynamics provide a principled and reliable
criterion for convergence and early stopping. Experiments across coding
(HumanEval +6.3, MBPP +2.6) and reasoning (GSM8K +2.9, MATH500 +3.8) show that
LRD improves accuracy while delivering speedups of up to 10.6x, making it a
strong and versatile alternative for parallel sequence generation.

### [188] [Enhancing LLM Reasoning via Non-Human-Like Reasoning Path Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11104)
*Junjie Lu,Yuliang Liu,Chaofeng Qu,Wei Shen,Zhouhan Lin,Min Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Confidence-Guided Reasoning Path Preference Optimization (CGPO), which enhances reasoning in large language models (LLMs) by focusing on their points of uncertainty, instead of relying on human-like reasoning pathways.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for improving LLM reasoning largely depend on human annotations or higher-capacity models, which restrict the exploration of alternative reasoning paths and limit model performance.

Method: The CGPO method uses confidence signals to pinpoint the model's areas of greatest uncertainty during the reasoning process. At these points, the model receives self-guided (non-human-like) guidance to reduce reasoning errors and trajectory drift.

Result: Experiments covering both code and mathematical reasoning demonstrate that CGPO, even when trained with data from smaller models, outperforms methods relying on data from strong models or human annotations in most cases.

Conclusion: CGPO offers a promising alternative to traditional human-centric training methods by emphasizing model-specific uncertainty, leading to improved reasoning capabilities with more efficient data usage.

Abstract: Current approaches for strengthening LLM reasoning tend to introduce a
training bias toward human-like reasoning trajectories. In step-wise preference
optimization, in particular, dependence on human or higher-capacity model
annotations for intermediate steps limits exploration of alternative,
non-human-like reasoning paths and thus constrains achievable performance.
Furthermore, through a small-scale pilot study, we observed that in
approximately 75% of cases, the model's first erroneous step occurs after the
lowest-confidence point. This suggests that guiding the model at its
lowest-confidence point before an error provides more accurate supervision than
locating the first explicit error. In this paper, we propose Confidence-Guided
Reasoning Path Preference Optimization (CGPO), a method that leverages a
confidence signal to identify points of maximal uncertainty in the model's
reasoning process and applies self-generated, non-human-like reasoning-path
guidance to mitigate trajectory drift. Our experiments span diverse models
applied to both code and mathematical reasoning tasks. The results show that,
with the same amount of training data, our method using data generated by a
small model can achieve better performance in most cases compared with
approaches using data generated by a strong model or human-annotated.

TL;DR: TypePilot is introduced to enhance the security of LLM-generated code using strongly typed languages like Scala. Formal verification and general secure code are tested, showing improvements in safety constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite LLMs' proficiency in code generation, their outputs often have critical vulnerabilities, especially in high-assurance domains.

Method: TypePilot uses typed and verifiable languages (e.g., Scala) for secure code generation, evaluated via formal verification (Stainless framework) and general secure coding.

Result: Type-focused approaches mitigate input validation and injection vulnerabilities, outperforming naive direct code generation and prompting methods.

Conclusion: Structured, type-guided LLM workflows improve the safety and trustworthiness of automated code generation in sensitive systems.

Abstract: Large language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable proficiency in code
generation tasks across various programming languages. However, their outputs
often contain subtle but critical vulnerabilities, posing significant risks
when deployed in security-sensitive or mission-critical systems. This paper
introduces TypePilot, an agentic AI framework designed to enhance the security
and robustness of LLM-generated code by leveraging strongly typed and
verifiable languages, using Scala as a representative example. We evaluate the
effectiveness of our approach in two settings: formal verification with the
Stainless framework and general-purpose secure code generation. Our experiments
with leading open-source LLMs reveal that while direct code generation often
fails to enforce safety constraints, just as naive prompting for more secure
code, our type-focused agentic pipeline substantially mitigates input
validation and injection vulnerabilities. The results demonstrate the potential
of structured, type-guided LLM workflows to improve the SotA of the
trustworthiness of automated code generation in high-assurance domains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores distance-based unsupervised text classification in multi-label settings and introduces a novel label-specific thresholding method that improves classification performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle challenges in multi-label distance-based text classification and optimize thresholds for better semantic similarity evaluation across sentences and labels.

Method: The researchers performed exploratory studies on multi-label text classification datasets and proposed a label-specific thresholding optimization method. They evaluated sentence encoders across varying models and datasets.

Result: Similarity distributions vary across models, datasets, and label sets; the label-specific thresholding method improves classification performance by 46% over normalized 0.5 thresholding and 14% over prior uniform thresholding approaches.

Conclusion: Label-specific thresholding is effective, improving performance significantly even with limited labeled examples, advancing distance-based classification efficiency in multi-label scenarios.

Abstract: Distance-based unsupervised text classification is a method within text
classification that leverages the semantic similarity between a label and a
text to determine label relevance. This method provides numerous benefits,
including fast inference and adaptability to expanding label sets, as opposed
to zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuned neural networks that require re-training
in such cases. In multi-label distance-based classification and information
retrieval algorithms, thresholds are required to determine whether a text
instance is "similar" to a label or query. Similarity between a text and label
is determined in a dense embedding space, usually generated by state-of-the-art
sentence encoders. Multi-label classification complicates matters, as a text
instance can have multiple true labels, unlike in multi-class or binary
classification, where each instance is assigned only one label. We expand upon
previous literature on this underexplored topic by thoroughly examining and
evaluating the ability of sentence encoders to perform distance-based
classification. First, we perform an exploratory study to verify whether the
semantic relationships between texts and labels vary across models, datasets,
and label sets by conducting experiments on a diverse collection of realistic
multi-label text classification (MLTC) datasets. We find that similarity
distributions show statistically significant differences across models,
datasets and even label sets. We propose a novel method for optimizing
label-specific thresholds using a validation set. Our label-specific
thresholding method achieves an average improvement of 46% over normalized 0.5
thresholding and outperforms uniform thresholding approaches from previous work
by an average of 14%. Additionally, the method demonstrates strong performance
even with limited labeled examples.

### [191] [Bridging Gaps in Hate Speech Detection: Meta-Collections and Benchmarks for Low-Resource Iberian Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11167)
*Paloma Piot,José Ramom Pichel Campos,Javier Parapar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper focuses on addressing the lack of resources for hate speech detection in low-resource and linguistically diverse European languages. It creates a meta-collection of datasets for European Spanish, expands it to Portuguese and Galician, and establishes benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hate speech detection research is predominantly in English, with limited tools for low-resource languages, many of which have linguistic variations. This gap affects the development of effective hate speech detection systems.

Method: The researchers compiled a standardized meta-collection of hate speech datasets for European Spanish with unified labels and metadata. They expanded this into multilingual corpora by translating into European Portuguese and two variants of Galician. They evaluated state-of-the-art models in various settings and conducted cross-lingual analyses.

Result: The study provided new benchmarks for Iberian languages in hate speech detection and highlighted the performance of large language models in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings. It also underlined the effectiveness of multilingual approaches.

Conclusion: The research emphasizes the need for multilingual and linguistic variety-aware approaches to achieve better hate speech detection, addressing gaps in resources for underrepresented European languages.

Abstract: Hate speech poses a serious threat to social cohesion and individual
well-being, particularly on social media, where it spreads rapidly. While
research on hate speech detection has progressed, it remains largely focused on
English, resulting in limited resources and benchmarks for low-resource
languages. Moreover, many of these languages have multiple linguistic
varieties, a factor often overlooked in current approaches. At the same time,
large language models require substantial amounts of data to perform reliably,
a requirement that low-resource languages often cannot meet. In this work, we
address these gaps by compiling a meta-collection of hate speech datasets for
European Spanish, standardised with unified labels and metadata. This
collection is based on a systematic analysis and integration of existing
resources, aiming to bridge the data gap and support more consistent and
scalable hate speech detection. We extended this collection by translating it
into European Portuguese and into a Galician standard that is more convergent
with Spanish and another Galician variant that is more convergent with
Portuguese, creating aligned multilingual corpora. Using these resources, we
establish new benchmarks for hate speech detection in Iberian languages. We
evaluate state-of-the-art large language models in zero-shot, few-shot, and
fine-tuning settings, providing baseline results for future research. Moreover,
we perform a cross-lingual analysis with our target languages. Our findings
underscore the importance of multilingual and variety-aware approaches in hate
speech detection and offer a foundation for improved benchmarking in
underrepresented European languages.

### [192] [Evaluating Reasoning Faithfulness in Medical Vision-Language Models using Multimodal Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11196)
*Johannes Moll,Markus Graf,Tristan Lemke,Nicolas Lenhart,Daniel Truhn,Jean-Benoit Delbrouck,Jiazhen Pan,Daniel Rueckert,Lisa C. Adams,Keno K. Bressem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework to evaluate the faithfulness of chain-of-thought (CoT) explanations in chest X-ray visual question answering (VQA) by testing three axes: clinical fidelity, causal attribution, and confidence calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models (VLMs) produce plausible explanations that often fail to reflect true decision processes, which undermines trust, especially in clinical applications.

Method: The paper introduces a clinically grounded framework with controlled text and image modifications across three axes (clinical fidelity, causal attribution, and confidence calibration) and includes a reader study with radiologists to compare human alignment. It also benchmarks six VLMs on these criteria.

Result: Radiologists' evaluation is aligned with the axes to varying degrees: strong for attribution, moderate for fidelity, and weak for confidence calibration. Benchmarking showed that answer accuracy and explanation quality are not correlated, and proprietary models outperformed open-source ones in attribution and fidelity.

Conclusion: Final answer accuracy alone is insufficient for evaluating VLMs in clinical settings, as misalignment in explanations can pose deployment risks. Comprehensive evaluation criteria are essential to ensure trustworthy models.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) often produce chain-of-thought (CoT)
explanations that sound plausible yet fail to reflect the underlying decision
process, undermining trust in high-stakes clinical use. Existing evaluations
rarely catch this misalignment, prioritizing answer accuracy or adherence to
formats. We present a clinically grounded framework for chest X-ray visual
question answering (VQA) that probes CoT faithfulness via controlled text and
image modifications across three axes: clinical fidelity, causal attribution,
and confidence calibration. In a reader study (n=4), evaluator-radiologist
correlations fall within the observed inter-radiologist range for all axes,
with strong alignment for attribution (Kendall's $\tau_b=0.670$), moderate
alignment for fidelity ($\tau_b=0.387$), and weak alignment for confidence tone
($\tau_b=0.091$), which we report with caution. Benchmarking six VLMs shows
that answer accuracy and explanation quality are decoupled, acknowledging
injected cues does not ensure grounding, and text cues shift explanations more
than visual cues. While some open-source models match final answer accuracy,
proprietary models score higher on attribution (25.0% vs. 1.4%) and often on
fidelity (36.1% vs. 31.7%), highlighting deployment risks and the need to
evaluate beyond final answer accuracy.

### [193] [Discursive Circuits: How Do Language Models Understand Discourse Relations?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11210)
*Yisong Miao,Min-Yen Kan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates which components within transformer language models are responsible for discourse understanding and proposes sparse computational graphs called discursive circuits for this purpose.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding discourse relations in language requires processing longer text spans and complex reasoning, and identifying specific model components could improve these tasks.

Method: The authors introduce a novel task named Completion under Discourse Relation (CuDR) and build a tailored corpus of minimal contrastive pairs for activation patching to discover circuits responsible for discourse understanding.

Result: Sparse circuits occupying approximately 0.2% of GPT-2 can accurately recover discourse understanding. These circuits generalize well to different discourse frameworks (RST, SDRT). Lower layers focus on linguistic features, while upper layers specialize in discourse-level abstractions.

Conclusion: Sparse discursive circuits can efficiently handle discourse understanding and generalize across frameworks, highlighting the hierarchical role of transformer layers in linguistic and abstract processing.

Abstract: Which components in transformer language models are responsible for discourse
understanding? We hypothesize that sparse computational graphs, termed as
discursive circuits, control how models process discourse relations. Unlike
simpler tasks, discourse relations involve longer spans and complex reasoning.
To make circuit discovery feasible, we introduce a task called Completion under
Discourse Relation (CuDR), where a model completes a discourse given a
specified relation. To support this task, we construct a corpus of minimal
contrastive pairs tailored for activation patching in circuit discovery.
Experiments show that sparse circuits ($\approx 0.2\%$ of a full GPT-2 model)
recover discourse understanding in the English PDTB-based CuDR task. These
circuits generalize well to unseen discourse frameworks such as RST and SDRT.
Further analysis shows lower layers capture linguistic features such as lexical
semantics and coreference, while upper layers encode discourse-level
abstractions. Feature utility is consistent across frameworks (e.g.,
coreference supports Expansion-like relations).

*Chris Xing Tian,Weihao Xie,Zhen Chen,Zhengyuan Yi,Hui Liu,Haoliang Li,Shiqi Wang,Siwei Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RAGen is a modular framework for generating domain-specific data to enhance retrieval-augmented generation systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of domain-specific adaptation for RAG systems, which requires specialized training data beyond general-purpose question-answering.

Method: RAGen generates domain-grounded QAC triples by extracting key concepts from documents, creating diverse questions based on Bloom's Taxonomy, and pairing them with precise contextually-relevant answers. It includes features like semantic chunking and hierarchical concept extraction.

Result: RAGen effectively creates scalable and robust training data tailored for different RAG adaptation approaches while efficiently handling large and dynamically changing document corpora.

Conclusion: RAGen supports multiple adaptation strategies for RAG systems, offering scalability and modularity, thereby enhancing capabilities for domain-specific applications in areas like scientific research and enterprise knowledge bases.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines the language understanding and
reasoning power of large language models (LLMs) with external retrieval to
enable domain-grounded responses. Effectively adapting RAG systems to
domain-specific settings requires specialized, context-rich training data
beyond general-purpose question-answering. Here, we propose RAGen, a scalable
and modular framework for generating domain-grounded question-answer-context
(QAC) triples tailored to diverse RAG adaptation approaches. RAGen produces
these QAC triples by identifying key concepts in documents, generating diverse
questions guided by Bloom's Taxonomy-inspired principles, and pairing them with
precise answers extracted from relevant contexts. RAGen supports multiple RAG
adaptation strategies, including the optimization of key components such as the
LLM, retriever, and embedding model, etc. Its modular pipeline features
semantic chunking, hierarchical concept extraction, and multi-chunk retrieval,
along with the introduction of curated distractor contexts to promote robust
reasoning. Designed for scalability, RAGen efficiently handles large and
evolving document corpora without redundant processing, making it especially
suitable for dynamic evolving domains such as scientific research and
enterprise knowledge bases.

### [195] [The Curious Case of Factual (Mis)Alignment between LLMs' Short- and Long-Form Answers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11218)
*Saad Obaid ul Islam,Anne Lauscher,Goran Glavaš*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the inconsistency in factual responses of large language models (LLMs) between simple and complex queries, and introduces SLAQ as a framework to evaluate this misalignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the reliability gap in LLMs, where they perform well on simple factual queries but struggle with complex tasks, making their trustworthiness questionable.

Method: The authors introduced SLAQ, a framework that evaluates the consistency of LLMs’ answers to the same factual questions posed in both simple (short) and complex (long) forms, analyzing 16 LLMs across 600 queries.

Result: They identified a systematic misalignment in answers, position-dependent accuracy loss, and momentum effects. Mechanistic analysis revealed that facts activating overlapping model internals can predict short-long alignment with up to 78% accuracy.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the need for evaluating LLM trustworthiness through factual consistency across different query complexities and challenges assumptions underlying current evaluation practices.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can correctly answer "When was Einstein born?"
yet fail to provide the same date when writing about Einstein's life revealing
a fundamental inconsistency in how models access factual knowledge across task
complexities. While models display impressive accuracy on factual
question-answering benchmarks, the reliability gap between simple and complex
queries remains poorly understood, eroding their trustworthiness. In this work,
we introduce Short-Long Form Alignment for Factual Question Answering (SLAQ), a
controlled evaluation framework that compares LLMs' answers to the same factual
questions asked (a) in isolation (short) vs. (b) integrated into complex
queries (long). Looking at 16 LLMs across 600 queries, we find a systematic
misalignment of answers to the corresponding short and long queries. We further
uncover position-dependent accuracy loss and momentum effects where consecutive
correct or incorrect answers create self-reinforcing patterns. Through
mechanistic analysis, we find that aligned facts activate overlapping model
internals, and that metrics based on mechanistic similarity can predict
short-long answer alignment with up to 78% accuracy. Our work establishes
factual consistency over query complexity as an important aspect of LLMs'
trustworthiness and challenges current evaluation practices, which implicitly
assume that good performance for simple factual queries implies reliability in
more complex knowledge-seeking tasks too.

### [196] [WebRouter: Query-specific Router via Variational Information Bottleneck for Cost-sensitive Web Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11221)
*Tao Li,Jinlong Hu,Yang Wang,Junfeng Liu,Xuejun Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces WebRouter, a tool for LLM web agents to reduce costs while maintaining performance. It achieves this via a cost-aware Variational Information Bottleneck approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome the trade-off between costs and performance in LLM-driven web automation, which struggles with handling complex prompts.

Method: The core method involves using a cost-aware Variational Information Bottleneck (ca-VIB) objective to compress input prompts while minimizing costs.

Result: WebRouter reduced operational costs by 87.8% with only a 3.8% decrease in accuracy compared to the GPT-4o benchmark.

Conclusion: WebRouter effectively balances cost and performance, making it a highly efficient tool for web automation using LLMs.

Abstract: LLM-brained web agents offer powerful capabilities for web automation but
face a critical cost-performance trade-off. The challenge is amplified by web
agents' inherently complex prompts that include goals, action histories, and
environmental states, leading to degraded LLM ensemble performance. To address
this, we introduce WebRouter, a novel query-specific router trained from an
information-theoretic perspective. Our core contribution is a cost-aware
Variational Information Bottleneck (ca-VIB) objective, which learns a
compressed representation of the input prompt while explicitly penalizing the
expected operational cost. Experiments on five real-world websites from the
WebVoyager benchmark show that WebRouter reduces operational costs by a
striking 87.8\% compared to a GPT-4o baseline, while incurring only a 3.8\%
accuracy drop.

*Battemuulen Naranbat,Seyed Sahand Mohammadi Ziabari,Yousuf Nasser Al Husaini,Ali Mohammed Mansoor Alsahag*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study evaluates fairness in moral sentiment classification using transformer models across Twitter and Reddit domains, highlighting inconsistencies and introducing the Moral Fairness Consistency (MFC) metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address fairness violations and domain disparities in moral sentiment classification with transformer models like BERT across heterogeneous linguistic contexts.

Method: Evaluated BERT and DistilBERT models in multi-label settings under in-domain and cross-domain protocols using Twitter and Reddit datasets. Proposed the MFC metric to quantify fairness stability.

Result: Significant fairness disparities observed in cross-domain classification, with Twitter to Reddit showing a pronounced micro-F1 drop and fairness violations for specific labels like authority. MFC demonstrated strong empirical validity.

Conclusion: MFC metric serves as a diagnostic tool for fairness-aware evaluation, promoting reliable deployment of moral reasoning models across diverse domains.

Abstract: Ensuring fairness in natural language processing for moral sentiment
classification is challenging, particularly under cross-domain shifts where
transformer models are increasingly deployed. Using the Moral Foundations
Twitter Corpus (MFTC) and Moral Foundations Reddit Corpus (MFRC), this work
evaluates BERT and DistilBERT in a multi-label setting with in-domain and
cross-domain protocols. Aggregate performance can mask disparities: we observe
pronounced asymmetry in transfer, with Twitter->Reddit degrading micro-F1 by
14.9% versus only 1.5% for Reddit->Twitter. Per-label analysis reveals fairness
violations hidden by overall scores; notably, the authority label exhibits
Demographic Parity Differences of 0.22-0.23 and Equalized Odds Differences of
0.40-0.41. To address this gap, we introduce the Moral Fairness Consistency
(MFC) metric, which quantifies the cross-domain stability of moral foundation
detection. MFC shows strong empirical validity, achieving a perfect negative
correlation with Demographic Parity Difference (rho = -1.000, p < 0.001) while
remaining independent of standard performance metrics. Across labels, loyalty
demonstrates the highest consistency (MFC = 0.96) and authority the lowest (MFC
= 0.78). These findings establish MFC as a complementary, diagnosis-oriented
metric for fairness-aware evaluation of moral reasoning models, enabling more
reliable deployment across heterogeneous linguistic contexts. .

*Hayate Funakura,Hyunsoo Kim,Koji Mineshima*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Graph-matching metrics like Smatch fail to adequately measure logical equivalence in semantic parsing. The paper proposes combining graph-matching with automated theorem proving for improved evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard graph-matching metrics prioritize surface overlap in evaluating semantic parsers but do not ensure logical equivalence, necessitating a better evaluation framework.

Method: The study evaluates supervised fine-tuning (T5-Small/Base) and few-shot in-context learning (GPT-4o/4.1/5) models using graph-matching metrics, logical entailment checks with a first-order logic theorem prover, and analysis of well-formedness under normalized and unnormalized outputs.

Result: Normalized targets improve well-formedness and logical adequacy. However, performance decreases with formula complexity and grammatical constructs like coordination and passive voice. Errors are linked to variable binding, indexing, and predicate naming.

Conclusion: Graph-matching metrics alone are insufficient for reasoning tasks. Evaluation should incorporate logic-sensitive methods and normalized target outputs. Simplifying target representations can improve semantic parsing outcomes.

Abstract: Graph-matching metrics such as Smatch are the de facto standard for
evaluating neural semantic parsers, yet they capture surface overlap rather
than logical equivalence. We reassess evaluation by pairing graph-matching with
automated theorem proving. We compare two approaches to building parsers:
supervised fine-tuning (T5-Small/Base) and few-shot in-context learning
(GPT-4o/4.1/5), under normalized and unnormalized targets. We evaluate outputs
using graph-matching, bidirectional entailment between source and target
formulas with a first-order logic theorem prover, and well-formedness. Across
settings, we find that models performing well on graph-matching often fail to
produce logically equivalent formulas. Normalization reduces incidental target
variability, improves well-formedness, and strengthens logical adequacy. Error
analysis shows performance degrades with increasing formula complexity and with
coordination, prepositional phrases, and passive voice; the dominant failures
involve variable binding and indexing, and predicate naming. These findings
highlight limits of graph-based metrics for reasoning-oriented applications and
motivate logic-sensitive evaluation and training objectives together with
simplified, normalized target representations. All code and data for our
experiments are publicly available.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CNSocialDepress, a new dataset for analyzing depression risk in Chinese social media, which supports both binary classification and in-depth psychological profiling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Chinese-language resources for detecting depression risks are scarce and lack multi-dimensional capabilities, prompting the authors to create a comprehensive dataset.

Method: They built CNSocialDepress using 44,178 user texts annotated with psychological attributes and binary risk labels, allowing both interpretable analysis and NLP task training.

Result: Their experiments demonstrated that the dataset enhances structured profiling and improves the fine-tuning of large language models for identifying depressive behavior.

Conclusion: CNSocialDepress provides a practical and effective tool for mental health analysis, meeting the needs of Chinese-speaking populations.

Abstract: Depression is a pressing global public health issue, yet publicly available
Chinese-language resources for risk detection remain scarce and are mostly
limited to binary classification. To address this limitation, we release
CNSocialDepress, a benchmark dataset for depression risk detection from Chinese
social media posts. The dataset contains 44,178 texts from 233 users, within
which psychological experts annotated 10,306 depression-related segments.
CNSocialDepress provides binary risk labels together with structured
multi-dimensional psychological attributes, enabling interpretable and
fine-grained analysis of depressive signals. Experimental results demonstrate
its utility across a wide range of NLP tasks, including structured
psychological profiling and fine-tuning of large language models for depression
detection. Comprehensive evaluations highlight the dataset's effectiveness and
practical value for depression risk identification and psychological analysis,
thereby providing insights to mental health applications tailored for
Chinese-speaking populations.

*Haoqi Yang,Yao Yao,Zuchao Li,Baoyuan Qi,Guoming Liu,Hai Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: XQuant is a novel quantization framework for large language models designed to reduce KV cache memory requirements while maintaining strong model accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the memory challenges posed by growing KV cache requirements in long-text understanding and generation within large language models, especially in resource-constrained environments.

Method: XQuant uses a training-free, plug-and-play quantization framework featuring a data-free calibration method and cross-layer KV cache compression, enabling ultra-low equivalent bit-width quantization.

Result: XQuant achieves sub-1.4 bit KV cache quantization, outperforming state-of-the-art methods like KIVI-2bit and AsymKV-1.5bit in terms of both memory efficiency and model accuracy.

Conclusion: XQuant establishes a superior balance between reducing memory consumption and maintaining high accuracy, making it an effective solution for deploying large language models in constrained settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse natural language processing tasks. However, their extensive memory
requirements, particularly due to KV cache growth during long-text
understanding and generation, present significant challenges for deployment in
resource-constrained environments. Quantization has emerged as a promising
solution to reduce memory consumption while preserving historical information.
We propose XQuant, a training-free and plug-and-play framework that achieves
ultra-low equivalent bit-width KV cache quantization. XQuant introduces two key
innovations: a computationally negligible data-free calibration method and
cross-layer KV cache compression, enabling quantization to sub-1.4 bits.
Extensive experiments on TruthfulQA and LongBench demonstrate that XQuant
outperforms state-of-the-art methods (e.g., KIVI-2bit and AsymKV-1.5bit) by
achieving lower bit-width while maintaining superior performance, establishing
a better trade-off between memory efficiency and model accuracy.

*Michael Schlichtkrull*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper identifies vulnerability in AI agents due to adversaries injecting biased or false information into retrieved data, termed as 'attack by content.' The authors propose repurposing automated fact-checking to defend against this.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address a new type of attack on AI agents, termed 'attack by content,' where adversaries supply biased, misleading, or false information to manipulate agent behavior.

Method: The paper proposes repurposing automated fact-checking from NLP as a cognitive self-defense framework for agents to critically evaluate retrieved data.

Result: The authors argue that current defenses are inadequate to handle 'attack by content' and outline the necessity for agents to corroborate claims with external evidence and evaluate trustworthiness.

Conclusion: Defending against 'attack by content' requires AI agents to integrate automated fact-checking mechanisms, focusing on evidence and source validation.

Abstract: When AI agents retrieve and reason over external documents, adversaries can
manipulate the data they receive to subvert their behaviour. Previous research
has studied indirect prompt injection, where the attacker injects malicious
instructions. We argue that injection of instructions is not necessary to
manipulate agents - attackers could instead supply biased, misleading, or false
information. We term this an attack by content. Existing defenses, which focus
on detecting hidden commands, are ineffective against attacks by content. To
defend themselves and their users, agents must critically evaluate retrieved
information, corroborating claims with external evidence and evaluating source
trustworthiness. We argue that this is analogous to an existing NLP task,
automated fact-checking, which we propose to repurpose as a cognitive
self-defense tool for agents.

*Jana Jung,Marlene Lutz,Indira Sen,Markus Strohmaier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Psychometric tests, originally for humans, show limitations in assessing constructs like sexism, racism, and morality in large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unclear reliability and validity of human-designed psychometric tests when applied to LLMs.

Method: Evaluate reliability through item and prompt variations, and validity via convergent correlations and ecological alignment with downstream tasks.

Result: Moderate reliability observed, but low ecological validity as test scores often poorly align with model behaviors.

Conclusion: Human psychometric tests require adaptation for meaningful evaluation of LLMs.

Abstract: Psychometric tests are increasingly used to assess psychological constructs
in large language models (LLMs). However, it remains unclear whether these
tests -- originally developed for humans -- yield meaningful results when
applied to LLMs. In this study, we systematically evaluate the reliability and
validity of human psychometric tests for three constructs: sexism, racism, and
morality. We find moderate reliability across multiple item and prompt
variations. Validity is evaluated through both convergent (i.e., testing
theory-based inter-test correlations) and ecological approaches (i.e., testing
the alignment between tests scores and behavior in real-world downstream
tasks). Crucially, we find that psychometric test scores do not align, and in
some cases even negatively correlate with, model behavior in downstream tasks,
indicating low ecological validity. Our results highlight that systematic
evaluations of psychometric tests is essential before interpreting their
scores. They also suggest that psychometric tests designed for humans cannot be
applied directly to LLMs without adaptation.

*Guangyu Wei,Ke Han,Yueming Lyu,Yu Luo,Yue Jiang,Caifeng Shan,Nicu Sebe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces EASE, a novel framework for real-time fake news detection that adapts its strategy based on available evidence, leveraging three perspectives: evidence, reasoning, and sentiment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fake news detection models struggle to perform well in real-time contexts where external evidence is scarce, necessitating a solution to improve generalization and accuracy.

Method: EASE employs a framework of three evaluation modules (evidence-based, reasoning-based, and sentiment-based fallback), instruction tuning with pseudo labels for interpretable reasoning, and integrates the perspectives with news content for better detection accuracy.

Result: EASE achieves state-of-the-art results across benchmarks and enhances generalization on emerging news with limited evidence, supported by a new benchmark dataset called RealTimeNews-25.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the challenge of real-time fake news detection by dynamically using available evidence and leveraging interpretable evaluations from multiple perspectives.

Abstract: Fake news detection becomes particularly challenging in real-time scenarios,
where emerging events often lack sufficient supporting evidence. Existing
approaches often rely heavily on external evidence and therefore struggle to
generalize under evidence scarcity. To address this issue, we propose
Evaluation-Aware Selection of Experts (EASE), a novel framework for real-time
fake news detection that dynamically adapts its decision-making process
according to the assessed sufficiency of available evidence. EASE introduces a
sequential evaluation mechanism comprising three independent perspectives: (1)
Evidence-based evaluation, which assesses evidence and incorporates it into
decision-making only when the evidence is sufficiently supportive; (2)
Reasoning-based evaluation, which leverages the world knowledge of large
language models (LLMs) and applies them only when their reliability is
adequately established; and (3) Sentiment-based fallback, which integrates
sentiment cues when neither evidence nor reasoning is reliable. To enhance the
accuracy of evaluation processes, EASE employs instruction tuning with pseudo
labels to guide each evaluator in justifying its perspective-specific knowledge
through interpretable reasoning. Furthermore, the expert modules integrate the
evaluators' justified assessments with the news content to enable
evaluation-aware decision-making, thereby enhancing overall detection accuracy.
Moreover, we introduce RealTimeNews-25, a new benchmark comprising recent news
for evaluating model generalization on emerging news with limited evidence.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that EASE not only achieves state-of-the-art
performance across multiple benchmarks, but also significantly improves
generalization to real-time news. The code and dataset are available:

*Nikita Afonin,Nikita Andriyanov,Nikhil Bageshpura,Kyle Liu,Kevin Zhu,Sunishchal Dev,Ashwinee Panda,Alexander Panchenko,Oleg Rogov,Elena Tutubalina,Mikhail Seleznyov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether emergent misalignment (EM), observed during narrow finetuning, appears in in-context learning (ICL). Results confirm EM with increasing examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if emergent misalignment (misaligned LLMs due to narrow optimization) occurs in in-context learning, an understudied area.

Method: Analyzed EM across three datasets and three models by testing responses under 64 to 256 in-context examples and examined reasoning mechanisms using chain-of-thought analysis.

Result: Models generated misaligned outputs at rates ranging from 2%-17% (64 examples) to 58% (256 examples). Step-by-step reasoning showed 67.5% misaligned outputs included harmful rationalizations.

Conclusion: Emergent misalignment arises in in-context learning, resembling previously observed patterns in finetuning, suggesting the persistence of misalignment risks across different methods.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that narrow finetuning can produce broadly misaligned
LLMs, a phenomenon termed emergent misalignment (EM). While concerning, these
findings were limited to finetuning and activation steering, leaving out
in-context learning (ICL). We therefore ask: does EM emerge in ICL? We find
that it does: across three datasets, three frontier models produce broadly
misaligned responses at rates between 2% and 17% given 64 narrow in-context
examples, and up to 58% with 256 examples. We also examine mechanisms of EM by
eliciting step-by-step reasoning (while leaving in-context examples unchanged).
Manual analysis of the resulting chain-of-thought shows that 67.5% of
misaligned traces explicitly rationalize harmful outputs by adopting a reckless
or dangerous ''persona'', echoing prior results on finetuning-induced EM.

### [205] [Are Large Language Models Effective Knowledge Graph Constructors?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11297)
*Ruirui Chen,Weifeng Jiang,Chengwei Qin,Bo Xiong,Fiona Liausvia,Dongkyu Choi,Boon Kiat Quek*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hierarchical framework for constructing high-quality knowledge graphs (KGs) using state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), addressing limitations in existing LLM-based approaches. They also release a dataset to aid research in this domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in constructing high-quality knowledge graphs and to utilize large language models effectively for semantically rich and interpretable graph creation.

Method: A hierarchical extraction framework is proposed, leveraging cutting-edge LLMs to extract and organize information at multiple levels for KG construction. The approach is evaluated both structurally and semantically.

Result: The framework demonstrates both the capabilities and limitations of current LLMs in KG construction. A dataset of KGs derived from research on children's mental well-being is provided to advance future studies.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances KG construction by enabling richer semantic structuring, while highlighting current challenges. This work paves the way for future advancements, particularly in critical fields like healthcare.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are vital for knowledge-intensive tasks and have shown
promise in reducing hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). However,
constructing high-quality KGs remains difficult, requiring accurate information
extraction and structured representations that support interpretability and
downstream utility. Existing LLM-based approaches often focus narrowly on
entity and relation extraction, limiting coverage to sentence-level contexts or
relying on predefined schemas. We propose a hierarchical extraction framework
that organizes information at multiple levels, enabling the creation of
semantically rich and well-structured KGs. Using state-of-the-art LLMs, we
extract and construct knowledge graphs and evaluate them comprehensively from
both structural and semantic perspectives. Our results highlight the strengths
and shortcomings of current LLMs in KG construction and identify key challenges
for future work. To advance research in this area, we also release a curated
dataset of LLM-generated KGs derived from research papers on children's mental
well-being. This resource aims to foster more transparent, reliable, and
impactful applications in high-stakes domains such as healthcare.

*Sabrina McCallum,Amit Parekh,Alessandro Suglia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes using language feedback to improve imitation learning in embodied AI, enabling learning from suboptimal demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of imitation learning, which struggles with learning from suboptimal demonstrations, and the data inefficiency of reinforcement learning.

Method: Incorporating language feedback embeddings into a Transformer-based policy along with auxiliary self-supervised learning objectives for feedback prediction.

Result: Their approach significantly improves compositional generalization and robustness in Vision-and-Language tasks using the BabyAI-XGen environment.

Conclusion: Language feedback is an effective and intuitive alternative to scalar rewards, turning suboptimal behaviors into learning opportunities.

Abstract: Current approaches to embodied AI tend to learn policies from expert
demonstrations. However, without a mechanism to evaluate the quality of
demonstrated actions, they are limited to learning from optimal behaviour, or
they risk replicating errors and inefficiencies. While reinforcement learning
offers one alternative, the associated exploration typically results in
sacrificing data efficiency. This work explores how agents trained with
imitation learning can learn robust representations from both optimal and
suboptimal demonstrations when given access to constructive language feedback
as a means to contextualise different modes of behaviour. We directly provide
language feedback embeddings as part of the input sequence into a
Transformer-based policy, and optionally complement the traditional next action
prediction objective with auxiliary self-supervised learning objectives for
feedback prediction. We test our approach on a range of embodied
Vision-and-Language tasks in our custom BabyAI-XGen environment and show
significant improvements in agents' compositional generalisation abilities and
robustness, suggesting that our data-efficient method allows models to
successfully convert suboptimal behaviour into learning opportunities. Overall,
our results suggest that language feedback is a competitive and intuitive
alternative to intermediate scalar rewards for language-specified embodied
tasks.

*Belkiss Souayed,Sarah Ebling,Yingqiang Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a structured vision-language model prompting framework to generate accessible images from simplified texts, evaluated via semantic alignment scores and expert assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving text comprehension for individuals with intellectual disabilities using accessible and simplified images generated from text.

Method: Developed five prompt templates (e.g., Basic Object Focus, Contextual Scene, etc.) with accessibility constraints and evaluated them on 400 text simplifications using both automatic semantic alignment scores and human experts.

Result: The Basic Object Focus prompt had the highest semantic alignment. Retro visual style was deemed most accessible, and Wikipedia was the best data source. Text simplicity had high inter-annotator agreement.

Conclusion: The framework provides guidelines for generating accessible content and highlights the importance of structured prompting in enhancing image accessibility for intellectual disabilities.

Abstract: Individuals with intellectual disabilities often have difficulties in
comprehending complex texts. While many text-to-image models prioritize
aesthetics over accessibility, it is not clear how visual illustrations relate
to text simplifications (TS) generated from them. This paper presents a
structured vision-language model (VLM) prompting framework for generating
accessible images from simplified texts. We designed five prompt templates,
i.e., Basic Object Focus, Contextual Scene, Educational Layout, Multi-Level
Detail, and Grid Layout, each following distinct spatial arrangements while
adhering to accessibility constraints such as object count limits, spatial
separation, and content restrictions. Using 400 sentence-level simplifications
from four established TS datasets (OneStopEnglish, SimPA, Wikipedia, and
ASSET), we conducted a two-phase evaluation: Phase 1 assessed prompt template
effectiveness with CLIPScores, and Phase 2 involved human annotation of
generated images across ten visual styles by four accessibility experts.
Results show that the Basic Object Focus prompt template achieved the highest
semantic alignment, indicating that visual minimalism enhances language
accessibility. Expert evaluation further identified Retro style as the most
accessible and Wikipedia as the most effective data source. Inter-annotator
agreement varied across dimensions, with Text Simplicity showing strong
reliability and Image Quality proving more subjective. Overall, our framework
offers practical guidelines for accessible content generation and underscores
the importance of structured prompting in AI-generated visual accessibility
tools.

### [208] [Do LLMs "Feel"? Emotion Circuits Discovery and Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11328)
*Chenxi Wang,Yixuan Zhang,Ruiji Yu,Yufei Zheng,Lang Gao,Zirui Song,Zixiang Xu,Gus Xia,Huishuai Zhang,Dongyan Zhao,Xiuying Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper uncovers and validates the mechanisms ("emotion circuits") that enable emotional expression in large language models (LLMs), achieving controlled emotion modification with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the increasing demand for emotional intelligence in LLMs, focusing on understanding and controlling the internal mechanisms behind emotional expression in generated text.

Method: The authors create a dataset, SEV, to evoke internal emotional states, identify and analyze emotion circuits via causal and decomposition techniques, and modulate these circuits to control emotional outcomes.

Result: The study identifies neuron-level and sublayer-level components responsible for emotional expression, constructs coherent global emotion circuits, and achieves 99.65% emotion-control accuracy on the test set, outperforming previous methods.

Conclusion: This study enhances the understanding of LLMs' internal emotional mechanisms, enabling precise emotional control and contributing to both model interpretability and the development of emotionally intelligent AI systems.

Abstract: As the demand for emotional intelligence in large language models (LLMs)
grows, a key challenge lies in understanding the internal mechanisms that give
rise to emotional expression and in controlling emotions in generated text.
This study addresses three core questions: (1) Do LLMs contain context-agnostic
mechanisms shaping emotional expression? (2) What form do these mechanisms
take? (3) Can they be harnessed for universal emotion control? We first
construct a controlled dataset, SEV (Scenario-Event with Valence), to elicit
comparable internal states across emotions. Subsequently, we extract
context-agnostic emotion directions that reveal consistent, cross-context
encoding of emotion (Q1). We identify neurons and attention heads that locally
implement emotional computation through analytical decomposition and causal
analysis, and validate their causal roles via ablation and enhancement
interventions. Next, we quantify each sublayer's causal influence on the
model's final emotion representation and integrate the identified local
components into coherent global emotion circuits that drive emotional
expression (Q2). Directly modulating these circuits achieves 99.65%
emotion-expression accuracy on the test set, surpassing prompting- and
steering-based methods (Q3). To our knowledge, this is the first systematic
study to uncover and validate emotion circuits in LLMs, offering new insights
into interpretability and controllable emotional intelligence.

### [209] [LLM-Specific Utility: A New Perspective for Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11358)
*Hengran Zhang,Keping Bi,Jiafeng Guo,Jiaming Zhang,Shuaiqiang Wang,Dawei Yin,Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores how retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) depends on large language models (LLMs) benefiting differently from the same retrieved passages due to their unique internal knowledge and understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitations of treating utility as a generic concept in RAG, by emphasizing that different LLMs interact with retrieved passages uniquely based on their comprehension capabilities.

Method: Large-scale experiments were conducted across various datasets and LLMs to assess how human-annotated and ground-truth utilitarian passages fare in facilitating effective RAG.

Result: It was found that human-annotated passages are often sub-optimal, and ground-truth utilitarian passages are not transferable between LLMs due to readability differences and perplexity as a key metric.

Conclusion: The paper argues for adopting LLM-specific utility in RAG research and proposes a benchmarking procedure for assessing utility judgments tailored to LLMs.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
incorporating external knowledge. While traditional retrieval focuses on
relevance, RAG's effectiveness depends on the utility of retrieved passages,
i.e., the usefulness in facilitating the generation of an accurate and
comprehensive answer. Existing studies often treat utility as a generic
attribute, ignoring the fact that different LLMs may benefit differently from
the same passage due to variations in internal knowledge and comprehension
ability. In this work, we introduce and systematically investigate the notion
of LLM-specific utility. Through large-scale experiments across multiple
datasets and LLMs, we demonstrate that human-annotated passages are not optimal
for LLMs and that ground-truth utilitarian passages are not transferable across
different LLMs. These findings highlight the necessity of adopting the
LLM-specific utility in RAG research. Our findings indicate that some
human-annotated passages are not ground-truth utilitarian passages for specific
LLMs, partially due to the varying readability of queries and passages for
LLMs, a tendency for which perplexity is a key metric. Based on these findings,
we propose a benchmarking procedure for LLM-specific utility judgments. We
evaluate existing utility judgment methods on six datasets and find that while
verbalized methods using pseudo-answers perform robustly, LLMs struggle to
assess utility effectively-failing to reject all passages for known queries and
to select truly useful ones for unknown queries.

*Wenhan Ma,Hailin Zhang,Liang Zhao,Yifan Song,Yudong Wang,Zhifang Sui,Fuli Luo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study addresses instability in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models during RL training due to inconsistent routing and proposes Rollout Routing Replay (R3) as a solution to stabilize training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the instability in RL training caused by routing discrepancies and divergence in MoE models.

Method: Introduced Rollout Routing Replay (R3), a method for recording and replaying routing distributions from inference during RL training.

Result: R3 significantly reduced training-inference policy divergence and prevented RL training collapse, outperforming existing methods such as GSPO and TIS.

Conclusion: Rollout Routing Replay (R3) provides an effective solution for stabilizing RL training in MoE models.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a crucial approach for enhancing
the capabilities of large language models. However, in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
models, the routing mechanism often introduces instability, even leading to
catastrophic RL training collapse. We analyze the training-inference
consistency of MoE models and identify a notable discrepancy in routing
behaviors between the two phases. Moreover, even under identical conditions,
the routing framework can yield divergent expert selections across repeated
forward passes. To address this foundational inconsistency, we propose Rollout
Routing Replay (R3), a method that records routing distributions from the
inference engine and replays them during training. R3 significantly reduces
training-inference policy KL divergence and mitigates extreme discrepancies
without compromising training speed. Extensive experiments on various settings
confirm that R3 succeeds in stabilizing RL training, preventing collapse and
outperforming methods such as GSPO and TIS. We believe this work can offer a
new solution for stabilizing RL in MoE models.

### [211] [Early Detection and Reduction of Memorisation for Domain Adaptation and Instruction Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11372)
*Dean L. Slack,Noura Al Moubayed*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates memorization during language model fine-tuning, showing it occurs early and proposing solutions to mitigate it effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the issue of language models memorizing private or copyrighted text during fine-tuning, which is less understood compared to pre-training memorization.

Method: The authors fine-tune various large language models on evaluation datasets, measure memorization using an n-gram score, introduce early-stopping criteria, and propose an n-gram-aware loss regularizer.

Result: Memorization intensifies within the first few epochs of fine-tuning, and the n-gram score predicts this behavior. The loss regularizer reduces memorization by up to 40% while maintaining evaluation performance.

Conclusion: Early detection via n-gram score and the proposed loss regularizer effectively mitigate memorization with minimal trade-offs, offering scalable insights into the dynamics of fine-tuning large language models.

Abstract: Although large language models excel across many tasks, they can memorise
training data and thereby expose private or copyrighted text. Most defences
target the pre-training stage, leaving memorisation during fine-tuning,
especially for domain adaptation and instruction tuning, poorly understood. We
fine-tune Pythia, Llama3, and Mistral models spanning 1.4B-70B parameters on
common evaluation datasets and track verbatim memorisation throughout training.
We find that memorisation increases dramatically in the first few epochs, often
significantly before either validation perplexity or evaluation performance is
optimised. We use a simple but effective n-gram memorisation score which
reliably precedes verbatim memorisation; using it as an early-stopping
criterion mitigates memorisation with minimal performance loss. Further, we
introduce an n-gram-aware loss regulariser and show that it reduces
memorisation across all model families tested by up to 40% while minimising
evaluation performance trade-offs when compared to an existing memorisation
mitigation strategy. These results yield practical, scalable insights into
memorisation dynamics during language model fine-tuning.

### [212] [Beyond Survival: Evaluating LLMs in Social Deduction Games with Human-Aligned Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11389)
*Zirui Song,Yuan Huang,Junchang Liu,Haozhe Luo,Chenxi Wang,Lang Gao,Zixiang Xu,Mingfei Han,Xiaojun Chang,Xiuying Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in using language models for social deduction games like Werewolf by introducing a high-quality multimodal dataset and a novel evaluation framework for strategic alignment, revealing LLMs' inadequacies in deception and counterfactual reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address limitations in prior research on social deduction games, which often simplify gameplay to LLM-based self-play with templated utterances and lack precise evaluation metrics for rich social interaction.

Method: A human-verified, multimodal Werewolf dataset was created, and a two-stage strategy-alignment evaluation was introduced: speech evaluation (assessing social stances) and decision evaluation (evaluating voting and role inference).

Result: The proposed evaluation showed diverse performance among state-of-the-art LLMs, with many scoring below 0.50, indicating significant shortcomings in abilities like deception and counterfactual reasoning.

Conclusion: The dataset and evaluation framework provide a robust resource for advancing research in language, strategy, and reasoning in multi-agent social contexts, highlighting gaps in current LLM capabilities.

Abstract: Social deduction games like Werewolf combine language, reasoning, and
strategy, providing a testbed for studying natural language and social
intelligence. However, most studies reduce the game to LLM-based self-play,
yielding templated utterances and anecdotal cases that overlook the richness of
social gameplay. Evaluation further relies on coarse metrics such as survival
time or subjective scoring due to the lack of quality reference data. To
address these gaps, we curate a high-quality, human-verified multimodal
Werewolf dataset containing over 100 hours of video, 32.4M utterance tokens,
and 15 rule variants. Based on this dataset, we propose a novel
strategy-alignment evaluation that leverages the winning faction's strategies
as ground truth in two stages: 1) Speech evaluation, formulated as
multiple-choice-style tasks that assess whether the model can adopt appropriate
stances across five dimensions of social ability; and 2) Decision evaluation,
which assesses the model's voting choices and opponent-role inferences. This
framework enables a fine-grained evaluation of models' linguistic and reasoning
capabilities, while capturing their ability to generate strategically coherent
gameplay. Our experiments show that state-of-the-art LLMs show diverse
performance, with roughly half remain below 0.50, revealing clear gaps in
deception and counterfactual reasoning. We hope our dataset further inspires
research on language, reasoning, and strategy in multi-agent interaction.

### [213] [KnowRL: Teaching Language Models to Know What They Know](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11407)
*Sahil Kale,Devendra Singh Dhami*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces KnowRL, a framework to improve AI models' awareness of their limitations by enhancing self-knowledge using introspection and consensus-based rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent AI models often fail to recognize their own limitations reliably, leading to untrustworthy responses and unsafe deployments. The paper aims to address the lack of self-awareness in language models.

Method: The KnowRL framework encompasses two key components: (i) introspection, involving self-classification of tasks as feasible or infeasible, and (ii) consensus-based reward mechanisms to reinforce consistent assessment of self-knowledge without external supervision.

Result: In experiments with LLaMA-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B, KnowRL improved self-knowledge, achieving up to 28% gains in accuracy and 12% in F1 scores, outperforming baseline methods with minimal iterations.

Conclusion: KnowRL enhances the self-awareness and reliability of AI models without external supervision, fostering safer and more accountable AI applications. Its simplicity and effectiveness make it suitable for broad adoption.

Abstract: Truly reliable AI requires more than simply scaling up knowledge; it demands
the ability to know what it knows and when it does not. Yet recent research
shows that even the best LLMs misjudge their own competence in more than one in
five cases, making any response born of such internal uncertainty impossible to
fully trust. Inspired by self-improvement reinforcement learning techniques
that require minimal data, we present a simple but powerful framework KnowRL
that strengthens a model's internal understanding of its own feasibility
boundaries, enabling safer and more responsible behaviour. Our framework
combines two components: (i) introspection, where the model generates and
classifies tasks it judges feasible or infeasible, and (ii) consensus-based
rewarding, where stability of self-knowledge assessment is reinforced through
internal agreement. By using internally generated data, this design strengthens
consistency in self-knowledge and entirely avoids costly external supervision.
In experiments on LLaMA-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B, KnowRL steadily improved
self-knowledge, validated by both intrinsic self-consistency and extrinsic
benchmarking. With nothing more than a small seed set and no external
supervision, our method drove gains as high as 28% in accuracy and 12% in F1,
outperforming baselines in just a few iterations. Our framework essentially
unlocks the untapped capacity of LLMs to self-improve their knowledge
awareness, opening the door to reliable, more accountable AI and safer
deployment in critical applications. Owing to its simplicity and independence
from external effort, we encourage applying this reliability-enhancing process
to all future models.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates using large language models (LLMs) to generate survey responses, identifies biases in their outputs, and combines bias-rectification methods for better population estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the high costs and slow execution of surveys by exploring scalable methods using LLMs, while addressing their bias and invalid estimates issues.

Method: The study combines LLM-generated survey responses with rectification methods, and tests the allocation of human responses for improved bias correction, using data from panel surveys on nutrition, politics, and economics.

Result: LLM-based synthesis introduces significant bias (24-86%), but integrating rectification methods reduces bias to below 5% and increases effective sample size by up to 14%.

Conclusion: Allocating human responses primarily for bias rectification, rather than fine-tuning, under a fixed budget leads to more effective survey estimates.

Abstract: Surveys provide valuable insights into public opinion and behavior, but their
execution is costly and slow. Large language models (LLMs) have been proposed
as a scalable, low-cost substitute for human respondents, but their outputs are
often biased and yield invalid estimates. We study the interplay between
synthesis methods that use LLMs to generate survey responses and rectification
methods that debias population estimates, and explore how human responses are
best allocated between them. Using two panel surveys with questions on
nutrition, politics, and economics, we find that synthesis alone introduces
substantial bias (24-86%), whereas combining it with rectification reduces bias
below 5% and increases effective sample size by up to 14%. Overall, we
challenge the common practice of using all human responses for fine-tuning,
showing that under a fixed budget, allocating most to rectification results in
far more effective estimation.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a data-driven method to assess LLM personality traits without using self-report surveys, evaluating six models against human-written text for personality and gender patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether large language models exhibit personality and demographic-like characteristics, and to better understand their behavioral tendencies compared to humans.

Method: The study applied automatic personality and gender classifiers to LLM-generated text in response to open-ended questions from Reddit. These were then compared with human-authored responses.

Result: LLMs displayed higher Agreeableness and lower Neuroticism compared to humans, indicating cooperative tendencies. Gendered language patterns in their output resembled human patterns but showed less variation.

Conclusion: The paper contributes a dataset and large-scale analysis, highlighting personality and demographic patterns in generative AI, revealing both similarities and differences with human traits.

Abstract: Generative large language models (LLMs) have become central to everyday life,
producing human-like text across diverse domains. A growing body of research
investigates whether these models also exhibit personality- and
demographic-like characteristics in their language. In this work, we introduce
a novel, data-driven methodology for assessing LLM personality without relying
on self-report questionnaires, applying instead automatic personality and
gender classifiers to model replies on open-ended questions collected from
Reddit. Comparing six widely used models to human-authored responses, we find
that LLMs systematically express higher Agreeableness and lower Neuroticism,
reflecting cooperative and stable conversational tendencies. Gendered language
patterns in model text broadly resemble those of human writers, though with
reduced variation, echoing prior findings on automated agents. We contribute a
new dataset of human and model responses, along with large-scale comparative
analyses, shedding new light on the topic of personality and demographic
patterns of generative AI.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GenCNER is a proposed generative framework aimed at addressing catastrophic forgetting and semantic shifts in Continual Named Entity Recognition (CNER).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses challenges such as catastrophic forgetting and semantic shift in Continual Named Entity Recognition (CNER), which emerge as new entity categories are added.

Method: It converts CNER into a sustained sequence generation task using pre-trained seq2seq models, complemented by a pseudo labeling strategy and knowledge distillation for preserving knowledge and reducing label noise.

Result: Experiments demonstrated GenCNER's superiority over previous state-of-the-art methods in multiple CNER settings, as well as its minimal gap compared to non-continual learning setups.

Conclusion: GenCNER effectively mitigates key drawbacks of existing CNER methodologies, showcasing its robustness and adaptability in dynamic real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Traditional named entity recognition (NER) aims to identify text mentions
into pre-defined entity types. Continual Named Entity Recognition (CNER) is
introduced since entity categories are continuously increasing in various
real-world scenarios. However, existing continual learning (CL) methods for NER
face challenges of catastrophic forgetting and semantic shift of non-entity
type. In this paper, we propose GenCNER, a simple but effective Generative
framework for CNER to mitigate the above drawbacks. Specifically, we skillfully
convert the CNER task into sustained entity triplet sequence generation problem
and utilize a powerful pre-trained seq2seq model to solve it. Additionally, we
design a type-specific confidence-based pseudo labeling strategy along with
knowledge distillation (KD) to preserve learned knowledge and alleviate the
impact of label noise at the triplet level. Experimental results on two
benchmark datasets show that our framework outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods in multiple CNER settings, and achieves the smallest
gap compared with non-CL results.

TL;DR: The paper explores using Large Language Models (LLMs) for text preprocessing tasks, achieving high accuracy and outperforming traditional methods in multiple languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional preprocessing methods often ignore contextual information, which can limit their effectiveness. The authors aim to leverage the contextual understanding of LLMs to improve preprocessing tasks with minimal language-specific resources.

Method: The authors evaluated LLM-based preprocessing (stopword removal, lemmatization, and stemming) against traditional algorithms across text classification tasks in six European languages.

Result: LLMs replicated traditional methods with accuracies of 97% for stopword removal, 82% for lemmatization, and 74% for stemming. Additionally, text preprocessed by LLMs improved ML algorithm performance by up to 6% in $F_1$ scores compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: LLMs are effective for text preprocessing tasks and offer significant performance improvements, making them a viable alternative to traditional methods. The authors provide their code and results online for validation and further research.

Abstract: Text preprocessing is a fundamental component of Natural Language Processing,
involving techniques such as stopword removal, stemming, and lemmatization to
prepare text as input for further processing and analysis. Despite the
context-dependent nature of the above techniques, traditional methods usually
ignore contextual information. In this paper, we investigate the idea of using
Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform various preprocessing tasks, due to
their ability to take context into account without requiring extensive
language-specific annotated resources. Through a comprehensive evaluation on
web-sourced data, we compare LLM-based preprocessing (specifically stopword
removal, lemmatization and stemming) to traditional algorithms across multiple
text classification tasks in six European languages. Our analysis indicates
that LLMs are capable of replicating traditional stopword removal,
lemmatization, and stemming methods with accuracies reaching 97%, 82%, and 74%,
respectively. Additionally, we show that ML algorithms trained on texts
preprocessed by LLMs achieve an improvement of up to 6% with respect to the
$F_1$ measure compared to traditional techniques. Our code, prompts, and

TL;DR: The paper identifies and addresses the 'Detection Dilemma' in detecting hallucinations in LLMs by proposing a unified framework that bridges the gap between two main methodologies, overcoming key barriers to improve detection capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing methods for detecting hallucinations in LLMs, which either fail at detecting logical fallacies or factual inconsistencies depending on the task type.

Method: The authors introduce a multi-path reasoning mechanism for extracting more comparable signals and a segment-aware temporalized cross-attention module to align and adaptively fuse these signals.

Result: The proposed framework outperforms strong baselines through extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks and leading LLMs.

Conclusion: The unified framework effectively resolves the 'Detection Dilemma' and offers a significant improvement in hallucination detection for LLMs, demonstrating versatility across various tasks.

Abstract: The detection of sophisticated hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs)
is hampered by a ``Detection Dilemma'': methods probing internal states
(Internal State Probing) excel at identifying factual inconsistencies but fail
on logical fallacies, while those verifying externalized reasoning
(Chain-of-Thought Verification) show the opposite behavior. This schism creates
a task-dependent blind spot: Chain-of-Thought Verification fails on
fact-intensive tasks like open-domain QA where reasoning is ungrounded, while
Internal State Probing is ineffective on logic-intensive tasks like
mathematical reasoning where models are confidently wrong. We resolve this with
a unified framework that bridges this critical gap. However, unification is
hindered by two fundamental challenges: the Signal Scarcity Barrier, as coarse
symbolic reasoning chains lack signals directly comparable to fine-grained
internal states, and the Representational Alignment Barrier, a deep-seated
mismatch between their underlying semantic spaces. To overcome these, we
introduce a multi-path reasoning mechanism to obtain more comparable,
fine-grained signals, and a segment-aware temporalized cross-attention module
to adaptively fuse these now-aligned representations, pinpointing subtle
dissonances. Extensive experiments on three diverse benchmarks and two leading
LLMs demonstrate that our framework consistently and significantly outperforms
strong baselines. Our code is available: https://github.com/peach918/HalluDet.

Motivation: The goal is to enhance token classification tasks by leveraging pretrained transformer models and graph-based methods, addressing limitations in sequential context modeling, especially in challenging domains like Vietnamese NER.

Method: TextGraphFuseGAT integrates PhoBERT embeddings with a fully connected graph structure processed by Graph Attention Networks. A Transformer-style self-attention layer refines these graph-enhanced embeddings, culminating in token classification through a dedicated head.

Result: The model achieves superior performance on three Vietnamese benchmarks—PhoNER-COVID19, PhoDisfluency, and the new VietMed-NER—surpassing both transformer-only and hybrid baseline models.

Conclusion: Graph-based relational modeling coupled with pretrained semantic embeddings offers significant improvements for token-level classification across diverse domains.

Abstract: We propose a novel neural architecture named TextGraphFuseGAT, which
integrates a pretrained transformer encoder (PhoBERT) with Graph Attention
Networks for token-level classification tasks. The proposed model constructs a
fully connected graph over the token embeddings produced by PhoBERT, enabling
the GAT layer to capture rich inter-token dependencies beyond those modeled by
sequential context alone. To further enhance contextualization, a
Transformer-style self-attention layer is applied on top of the graph-enhanced
embeddings. The final token representations are passed through a classification
head to perform sequence labeling. We evaluate our approach on three Vietnamese
benchmark datasets: PhoNER-COVID19 for named entity recognition in the COVID-19
domain, PhoDisfluency for speech disfluency detection, and VietMed-NER for
medical-domain NER. VietMed-NER is the first Vietnamese medical spoken NER
dataset, featuring 18 entity types collected from real-world medical speech
transcripts and annotated with the BIO tagging scheme. Its specialized
vocabulary and domain-specific expressions make it a challenging benchmark for
token-level classification models. Experimental results show that our method
consistently outperforms strong baselines, including transformer-only and
hybrid neural models such as BiLSTM + CNN + CRF, confirming the effectiveness
of combining pretrained semantic features with graph-based relational modeling
for improved token classification across multiple domains.

### [220] [Information-Preserving Reformulation of Reasoning Traces for Antidistillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11545)
*Jiayu Ding,Lei Cui,Li Dong,Nanning Zheng,Furu Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces PART, a technique to protect Large Language Models' (LLMs) reasoning traces from unauthorized distillation, while preserving valuable reasoning information for users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs use extended reasoning chains to boost complex task performance, but these traces can be exploited for distillation, creating a protection vs. usability trade-off.

Method: The paper proposes PART, a two-step process that reforms reasoning traces by removing self-talk and reordering sub-conclusions. A small auxiliary model performs the transformations with low computational cost.

Result: Experiments show that PART disrupts reasoning trace distillation across various benchmarks, reducing the performance of large student models on reformulated traces.

Conclusion: PART offers an effective balance between protecting reasoning traces and maintaining user accessibility, limiting distillation risks without heavily restricting information.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) show that extending the
length of reasoning chains significantly improves performance on complex tasks.
While revealing these reasoning traces helps users better follow, verify, and
learn from the model's problem-solving process, it also makes them highly
vulnerable to unauthorized distillation. To mitigate this risk, proprietary
model providers often adopt aggressive protection strategies, such as replacing
detailed reasoning with brief summaries, which deprive users of valuable
intermediate information. To address this trade-off, we propose PART, an
information-preserving antidistillation reformulation of reasoning traces.
Motivated by the difference between how humans understand reasoning traces and
how LLMs exploit them for supervised fine-tuning, we design a simple but
effective two-step reformulation: removing self-talk behaviors and reordering
sub-conclusions. A small auxiliary model is trained to perform this
reformulation, incurring minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PART consistently disrupts distillation across student models
of different sizes and types on various reasoning benchmarks. For instance,
when training on reformulated traces, even the performance of a large 32B
student model decreases from 54.17 to 46.88 on AIME 2024, corresponding to a
13.5% degradation.

### [221] [Invisible Languages of the LLM Universe](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11557)
*Saurabh Khanna,Xinxu Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores linguistic inequality in AI systems, highlighting exclusion of many high-vitality languages from digital ecosystems, and proposes a structural explanation rooted in colonial power dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address why many living languages, despite having millions of speakers, are underrepresented or invisible in AI and digital ecosystems.

Method: The authors propose a critical framework combining empirical measurements of real-world language vitality with online presence, postcolonial theories, and epistemic injustice to analyze linguistic patterns.

Result: Four categories of languages were identified based on vitality and digitality measurements: Strongholds, Digital Echoes, Fading Voices, and Invisible Giants. The study demonstrates continuity between colonial linguistic hierarchies and modern AI systems.

Conclusion: Exclusion of marginalized languages in AI systems reflects structural power dynamics rather than technical necessities. The study advocates for decolonizing language technology to make AI more accessible and inclusive.

Abstract: Large Language Models are trained on massive multilingual corpora, yet this
abundance masks a profound crisis: of the world's 7,613 living languages,
approximately 2,000 languages with millions of speakers remain effectively
invisible in digital ecosystems. We propose a critical framework connecting
empirical measurements of language vitality (real world demographic strength)
and digitality (online presence) with postcolonial theory and epistemic
injustice to explain why linguistic inequality in AI systems is not incidental
but structural. Analyzing data across all documented human languages, we
identify four categories: Strongholds (33%, high vitality and digitality),
Digital Echoes (6%, high digitality despite declining vitality), Fading Voices
(36%, low on both dimensions), and critically, Invisible Giants (27%, high
vitality but near-zero digitality) - languages spoken by millions yet absent
from the LLM universe. We demonstrate that these patterns reflect continuities
from colonial-era linguistic hierarchies to contemporary AI development,
constituting what we term digital epistemic injustice. Our analysis reveals
that English dominance in AI is not a technical necessity but an artifact of
power structures that systematically exclude marginalized linguistic knowledge.
We conclude with implications for decolonizing language technology and
democratizing access to AI benefits.

*Shreya Havaldar,Sunny Rai,Young-Min Cho,Lyle Ungar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper establishes a benchmark and framework to evaluate LLMs on cultural adaptation in conversational settings, showing challenges these models face.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks fail to address the real challenges LLMs experience when engaging users from varying cultural backgrounds.

Method: The authors created a benchmark dataset based on sociocultural theory with diverse cultural raters to assess LLMs' conversational framing, stylistic sensitivity, and subjective correctness.

Result: Evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs with this benchmark demonstrated their struggle to adapt culturally in conversational contexts.

Conclusion: LLMs need more effective mechanisms for cultural adaptation to perform well across diverse conversational scenarios.

Abstract: Existing benchmarks that measure cultural adaptation in LLMs are misaligned
with the actual challenges these models face when interacting with users from
diverse cultural backgrounds. In this work, we introduce the first framework
and benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs in realistic, multicultural
conversational settings. Grounded in sociocultural theory, our framework
formalizes how linguistic style - a key element of cultural communication - is
shaped by situational, relational, and cultural context. We construct a
benchmark dataset based on this framework, annotated by culturally diverse
raters, and propose a new set of desiderata for cross-cultural evaluation in
NLP: conversational framing, stylistic sensitivity, and subjective correctness.
We evaluate today's top LLMs on our benchmark and show that these models
struggle with cultural adaptation in a conversational setting.

### [223] [LLMAtKGE: Large Language Models as Explainable Attackers against Knowledge Graph Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11584)
*Ting Li,Yang Yang,Yipeng Yu,Liang Yao,Guoqing Chao,Ruifeng Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces LLMAtKGE, a framework utilizing large language models for adversarial attacks on knowledge graph embeddings, enhancing attack effectiveness and providing human-readable explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve adversarial attacks on knowledge graph embeddings by addressing limitations in explanation generation and generalizability.

Method: LLMAtKGE employs LLMs for attack target selection and explanation generation, using structured prompting, semantics-based and centrality-based filters, and fine-tuning techniques.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that LLMAtKGE outperforms black-box baselines, provides reasoned explanations, and offers comparable performance to white-box methods.

Conclusion: LLMAtKGE not only enhances adversarial attack methods but also proves effective in explanation generation and high-performance attacks, validated through ablation studies.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on knowledge graph embeddings (KGE) aim to disrupt the
model's ability of link prediction by removing or inserting triples. A recent
black-box method has attempted to incorporate textual and structural
information to enhance attack performance. However, it is unable to generate
human-readable explanations, and exhibits poor generalizability. In the past
few years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful capabilities
in text comprehension, generation, and reasoning. In this paper, we propose
LLMAtKGE, a novel LLM-based framework that selects attack targets and generates
human-readable explanations. To provide the LLM with sufficient factual context
under limited input constraints, we design a structured prompting scheme that
explicitly formulates the attack as multiple-choice questions while
incorporating KG factual evidence. To address the context-window limitation and
hesitation issues, we introduce semantics-based and centrality-based filters,
which compress the candidate set while preserving high recall of
attack-relevant information. Furthermore, to efficiently integrate both
semantic and structural information into the filter, we precompute high-order
adjacency and fine-tune the LLM with a triple classification task to enhance
filtering performance. Experiments on two widely used knowledge graph datasets
demonstrate that our attack outperforms the strongest black-box baselines and
provides explanations via reasoning, and showing competitive performance
compared with white-box methods. Comprehensive ablation and case studies
further validate its capability to generate explanations.

*Georg Ahnert,Anna-Carolina Haensch,Barbara Plank,Markus Strohmaier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study examines how various methods for simulating survey responses with Large Language Models affect the results, showing that restricted methods perform best and providing guidelines for implementation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standardize and enhance practices for generating survey responses from LLMs, addressing inconsistencies in methods used in prior research.

Method: The paper systematically compares 8 different Survey Response Generation Methods across 32 million simulated responses, using 4 political surveys and 10 language models.

Result: Significant differences were identified in the alignment of simulated survey responses based on the chosen methods, with restricted methods proving superior overall.

Conclusion: Survey Response Generation Methods impact simulated responses considerably, and the authors recommend best practices to improve reliability and consistency.

Abstract: Many in-silico simulations of human survey responses with large language
models (LLMs) focus on generating closed-ended survey responses, whereas LLMs
are typically trained to generate open-ended text instead. Previous research
has used a diverse range of methods for generating closed-ended survey
responses with LLMs, and a standard practice remains to be identified. In this
paper, we systematically investigate the impact that various Survey Response
Generation Methods have on predicted survey responses. We present the results
of 32 mio. simulated survey responses across 8 Survey Response Generation
Methods, 4 political attitude surveys, and 10 open-weight language models. We
find significant differences between the Survey Response Generation Methods in
both individual-level and subpopulation-level alignment. Our results show that
Restricted Generation Methods perform best overall, and that reasoning output
does not consistently improve alignment. Our work underlines the significant
impact that Survey Response Generation Methods have on simulated survey
responses, and we develop practical recommendations on the application of
Survey Response Generation Methods.

### [225] [MeTA-LoRA: Data-Efficient Multi-Task Fine-Tuning for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11598)
*Bo Cheng,Xu Wang,Jinda Liu,Yi Chang,Yuan Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MeTA-LoRA enhances LoRA's efficiency in adapting large language models to multi-task scenarios by introducing a two-stage optimization framework, achieving high performance with significantly less data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA struggles with data efficiency in multi-task learning settings, often requiring substantial task-specific data to perform well.

Method: MeTA-LoRA uses a two-stage approach: (1) task-specific adapters are trained with minimal data, and (2) a shared adapter is updated with multi-task gradient aggregation to foster knowledge transfer across tasks.

Result: MeTA-LoRA matches or surpasses traditional LoRA performance using significantly less task-specific data, both in multi-task and multilingual scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed method demonstrates improved data efficiency for multi-task adaptation in LLMs while maintaining or improving performance.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as one of the most widely used
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods for adapting large language
models (LLMs) to downstream tasks. While highly effective in single-task
settings, it struggles to efficiently leverage inter-task knowledge in complex
multi-task learning scenarios, often requiring substantial task-specific data
to achieve optimal performance. To address this limitation, we introduce
MeTA-LoRA, a two-stage optimization framework that significantly improves data
efficiency in multi-task adaptation. In the first stage, task-specific LoRA
adapters are learned using only a few samples from each involved dataset,
enabling rapid adaptation without large-scale supervision. In the second stage,
the shared LoRA adapter is updated by aggregating gradients from multiple tasks
to promote knowledge transfer across tasks, further reducing data usage by
leveraging common patterns. In both multi-task learning and multilingual
learning scenarios, our method matches or surpasses the performance of
traditional full-data LoRA fine-tuning approaches, while using significantly
less task-specific data.

*Marc Brinner,Sina Zarrieß*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SemCSE-Multi is an unsupervised framework for generating versatile embeddings for scientific abstracts, enabling focused similarity evaluations and adaptable visualizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for embeddings that capture distinct, controllable aspects of scientific abstracts for fine-grained analysis and enhanced domain visualizations.

Method: The framework creates aspect-specific summary sentences, trains embeddings to map similar summaries together, combines aspect-specific capabilities into one model, and introduces a decoding pipeline for interpreting embeddings in natural language.

Result: The approach achieves effective aspect-specific embeddings, visualizes multifaceted patterns, and ensures interpretable representations even for unoccupied visualization areas.

Conclusion: SemCSE-Multi offers robust tools for controllable and interpretable analysis of scientific abstracts, enhancing user-driven exploration in scientific domains.

Abstract: We propose SemCSE-Multi, a novel unsupervised framework for generating
multifaceted embeddings of scientific abstracts, evaluated in the domains of
invasion biology and medicine. These embeddings capture distinct, individually
specifiable aspects in isolation, thus enabling fine-grained and controllable
similarity assessments as well as adaptive, user-driven visualizations of
scientific domains. Our approach relies on an unsupervised procedure that
produces aspect-specific summarizing sentences and trains embedding models to
map semantically related summaries to nearby positions in the embedding space.
We then distill these aspect-specific embedding capabilities into a unified
embedding model that directly predicts multiple aspect embeddings from a
scientific abstract in a single, efficient forward pass. In addition, we
introduce an embedding decoding pipeline that decodes embeddings back into
natural language descriptions of their associated aspects. Notably, we show
that this decoding remains effective even for unoccupied regions in
low-dimensional visualizations, thus offering vastly improved interpretability
in user-centric settings.

*Huiyin Xue,Nafise Sadat Moosavi,Nikolaos Aletras*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines the key components of Transformer attention mechanisms by testing controlled variants and hybrid models. Token mixing is crucial for functionality, while other aspects can be relaxed under certain conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the necessity of each key principle behind Transformer attention mechanisms and explore simpler yet effective architectural alternatives.

Method: The study involved creating controlled variants of the Transformer attention mechanism that selectively relax specific principles and testing them both uniformly across layers and as hybrid models interleaved with standard attention layers.

Result: Token mixing mechanisms are critical for effective model performance, while the exact mathematical forms and sequence dependency can be meaningfully reduced without a full breakdown under certain hybrid configurations.

Conclusion: The results suggest opportunities for simplifying Transformer language models, as relaxation of certain principles doesn't necessarily lead to performance losses when mixed with standard configurations.

Abstract: The success of Transformer language models is widely credited to their
dot-product attention mechanism, which interweaves a set of key design
principles: mixing information across positions (enabling multi-token
interactions), sequence-dependent activations (where attention weights adapt to
each input), a specific mathematical form (dot-product similarities plus
softmax weighting), and coupling of queries and keys to evolving hidden states
(grounding attention in the current layer). However, the necessity of each of
these principles remains largely untested. In this work, we systematically
deconstruct attention by designing controlled variants that selectively relax
these principles, applied both uniformly across all layers and in hybrid
architectures where only some layers retain standard attention. Our empirical
analysis reveals that mechanisms for mixing tokens are indispensable, as their
absence collapses models to near-random behavior, while the exact mathematical
form and sequence dependency can be substantially relaxed, especially when
preserved in just a subset of layers. Surprisingly, even variants that fail in
isolation can achieve robust performance when interleaved with standard
attention, highlighting a cooperative effect. These findings deepen our
understanding of what truly underpins attention's effectiveness and open new
avenues for simplifying language models without sacrificing performance.

*Xurong Xie,Zhucun Xue,Jiafu Wu,Jian Li,Yabiao Wang,Xiaobin Hu,Yong Liu,Jiangning Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces AdaKD, a dynamic knowledge distillation framework for language models that adapts to token difficulty, enhancing student model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current knowledge distillation methods for compressing large-scale language models use static strategies that fail to adapt to the dynamic learning needs of student models.

Method: AdaKD employs a token difficulty metric to drive two modules: LATF dynamically redistributes focus on tokens based on learning stability, and IDTS uses a temperature strategy to handle token difficulty levels smartly.

Result: AdaKD consistently improves the outcomes of various distillation methods across different model architectures and benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed AdaKD framework enhances knowledge distillation effectiveness by making the process adaptive and token-specific, ensuring better knowledge transfer and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a key technique for compressing large-scale
language models (LLMs), yet prevailing logit-based methods typically employ
static strategies that are misaligned with the dynamic learning process of
student models. These methods typically treat all tokens indiscriminately and
apply a single, fixed temperature, resulting in suboptimal knowledge transfer.
To address these limitations, we propose LLM-Oriented Token-Adaptive Knowledge
Distillation (AdaKD), a novel framework that adapts the distillation process to
the real-time learning state of each token. AdaKD consists of two synergistic
modules driven by a unified token difficulty metric. First, our Loss-Driven
Adaptive Token Focusing (LATF) module dynamically adjusts the distillation
focus by monitoring the student's learning stability, concentrating
computational resources on the most valuable tokens at each training phase.
Second, we introduce Inverse Difficulty Temperature Scaling (IDTS), a
counterintuitive yet effective token-level temperature strategy. It employs low
temperatures for difficult tokens for targeted error correction, and high
temperatures for easy tokens to encourage students to learn from the teacher's
complete and smooth output distribution, thereby enhancing generalization. As a
plug-and-play framework, AdaKD can consistently improve the performance of
various distillation methods on multiple model architectures and benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid bottom-up approach to long-form story generation using multi-agent simulations to foster spontaneous and coherent narratives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for long-form story generation lack organic evolution in character development and plot progression, often relying on rigid structures.

Method: A dynamic sandbox environment is established where agents interact, generating emergent events that serve as the foundation for plot and character development.

Result: The system excels in generating coherent stories exceeding 10,000 words, achieving state-of-the-art performance across various metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a scalable and innovative solution for crafting immersive and dynamic long-form stories, overcoming key limitations of traditional approaches.

Abstract: Human writers often begin their stories with an overarching mental scene,
where they envision the interactions between characters and their environment.
Inspired by this creative process, we propose a novel approach to long-form
story generation, termed hybrid bottom-up long-form story generation, using
multi-agent simulations. In our method, agents interact within a dynamic
sandbox environment, where their behaviors and interactions with one another
and the environment generate emergent events. These events form the foundation
for the story, enabling organic character development and plot progression.
Unlike traditional top-down approaches that impose rigid structures, our hybrid
bottom-up approach allows for the natural unfolding of events, fostering more
spontaneous and engaging storytelling. The system is capable of generating
stories exceeding 10,000 words while maintaining coherence and consistency,
addressing some of the key challenges faced by current story generation models.
We achieve state-of-the-art performance across several metrics. This approach
offers a scalable and innovative solution for creating dynamic, immersive
long-form stories that evolve organically from agent-driven interactions.

*Siheng Xiong,Ali Payani,Faramarz Fekri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of reasoning errors in language models with Multi-Path Plan Aggregation (MPPA) and a scalable preference optimization scheme, achieving superior performance in reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper tackles the issue of chain-of-thought (CoT) derailment in language models, particularly smaller ones, where limited capacity causes reasoning trajectories to drift due to planning errors.

Method: The authors propose the MPPA framework, which integrates plan exploration and aggregation with a lightweight LoRA module. They also introduce Step-DPO, a stepwise preference optimization using Twisted Sequential Monte Carlo for better training efficiency.

Result: Extensive experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks show that the proposed method outperforms baselines with minimal supervised and preference data, achieving higher accuracy and stability.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that augmenting single-pass reasoning and improving planning can significantly boost the performance of language models on reasoning tasks, even with limited data and resources.

Abstract: Inference-time scaling enhances the reasoning ability of a language model
(LM) by extending its chain-of-thought (CoT). However, existing approaches
typically generate the entire reasoning chain in a single forward pass, which
often leads to CoT derailment, i.e., the reasoning trajectory drifting off
course due to compounding errors. This problem is particularly severe for
smaller LMs with long CoTs due to their limited capacity. To address this, we
analyze raw long CoTs and uncover a reasoning hierarchy consisting of planning
and execution steps. Our analysis reveals that most reasoning errors stem from
incorrect planning. Motivated by this observation, we propose Multi-Path Plan
Aggregation (MPPA), a framework that augments single-pass reasoning with plan
exploration and aggregation. Following a variable interval schedule based on
the token position, MPPA generates multiple candidate plans and aggregates them
into a refined planning step. To maintain efficiency, we adopt a minimal design
in which the base LM serves as the primary policy, while a lightweight LoRA
module implements the plan aggregation policy. We further observe that
outcome-reward RL is inefficient for long trajectories (e.g., exceeding 4K
tokens). To overcome this, we introduce online Step-DPO, a process-level
preference optimization scheme that leverages Twisted Sequential Monte Carlo
(TSMC) to provide scalable stepwise supervision using small LMs. This yields
more efficient training, improved stability, and higher accuracy. Extensive
experiments on challenging math, science, and logical reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that, with only 10% SFT data and 5% of preference pairs, our method
outperforms both the DeepSeek-R1 distillation baseline and the outcome-reward
RL baseline across multiple base models and tasks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Acadreason, a benchmark for evaluating the high-level reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) and agents across five academic domains. Current models struggle significantly on this benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LLMs lack sufficient depth in evaluating high-level reasoning capabilities within academic contexts.

Method: The authors created Acadreason, a benchmark comprising 50 expert-annotated academic problems across domains like computer science, economics, law, mathematics, and philosophy. Questions are sourced from top-tier publications and undergo rigorous quality control.

Result: Systematic evaluations show most LLMs scored below 20 points, with even GPT-5 only achieving 16 points. Agents performed slightly better but did not exceed 40 points.

Conclusion: There is a significant capability gap in current LLMs and agents for handling high-level academic reasoning tasks, emphasizing the challenges highlighted by Acadreason.

Abstract: In recent years, the research focus of large language models (LLMs) and
agents has shifted increasingly from demonstrating novel capabilities to
complex reasoning and tackling challenging tasks. However, existing evaluations
focus mainly on math/code contests or general tasks, while existing
multi-domain academic benchmarks lack sufficient reasoning depth, leaving the
field without a rigorous benchmark for high-level reasoning. To fill this gap,
we introduce the Acadreason benchmark, designed to evaluate the ability of LLMs
and agents to acquire and reason over academic knowledge. It consists of 50
expert-annotated academic problems across five high-reasoning domains,
including computer science, economics, law, mathematics, and philosophy. All
questions are sourced from top-tier publications in recent years and undergo
rigorous annotation and quality control to ensure they are both challenging and
answerable. We conduct systematic evaluations of over 10 mainstream LLMs and
agents. The results show that most LLMs scored below 20 points, with even the
cutting-edge GPT-5 achieving only 16 points. While agents achieved higher
scores, none exceeded 40 points. This demonstrates the current capability gap
between LLMs and agents in super-intelligent academic research tasks and
highlights the challenges of Acadreason.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the LCO-Emb framework and provides insights into why multimodal large language models (MLLMs) fine-tuned with contrastive learning succeed, discovering alignment and proposing scaling laws.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why multimodal large language models fine-tuned with contrastive learning excel and further enhance their representational quality.

Method: Analyzed anisotropy and kernel similarity to uncover latent alignment in MLLMs, proposed the LCO-Emb framework, and formulated a Generation-Representation Scaling Law (GRSL) relating generative and representational capabilities.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance in multimodal tasks using LCO-Emb and showed that generative pretraining improves contrastive learning outcomes, validated on low-resource visual-document retrieval tasks.

Conclusion: Generative pretraining enhances multimodal embedding quality, and leveraging the generative-representational scaling relationship can significantly improve model performance in diverse tasks.

Abstract: Recent multimodal embedding approaches leveraging multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) fine-tuned with contrastive learning (CL) have shown promising
results, yet the underlying reasons behind their superiority remain
underexplored. This work argues that a crucial advantage of MLLM-based
approaches stems from implicit cross-modal alignment achieved during generative
pretraining, where the language decoder learns to exploit multimodal signals
within a shared representation space for generating unimodal outputs. Through
analysis of anisotropy and kernel similarity structure, we empirically confirm
that latent alignment emerges within MLLM representations, allowing CL to serve
as a lightweight refinement stage. Leveraging this insight, we propose a
Language-Centric Omnimodal Embedding framework, termed LCO-Emb. Extensive
experiments across diverse backbones and benchmarks demonstrate its
effectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art performance across modalities.
Furthermore, we identify a Generation-Representation Scaling Law (GRSL),
showing that the representational capabilities gained through contrastive
refinement scales positively with the MLLM's generative capabilities. This
suggests that improving generative abilities evolves as an effective paradigm
for enhancing representation quality. We provide a theoretical explanation of
GRSL, which formally links the MLLM's generative quality to the upper bound on
its representation performance, and validate it on a challenging, low-resource
visual-document retrieval task, showing that continual generative pretraining
before CL can further enhance the potential of a model's embedding
capabilities. Codes, models, and resources are available at

TL;DR: This study introduces Agent Market Arena (AMA), a real-time benchmark for evaluating LLM-based trading agents in live markets with verified data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in financial trading, but there is limited evidence of their reasoning and adaptability in live market conditions.

Method: The authors developed AMA, a lifelong framework that integrates verified trading data, expert-checked news, and various agent architectures to evaluate LLM-based agents across live cryptocurrency and stock markets.

Result: Live experiments revealed varying behavioral patterns among trading agents, with differences shaped largely by agent frameworks rather than the underlying language model backbones.

Conclusion: Agent Market Arena sets a new standard for consistent and rigorous evaluation of LLM-based trading agents, paving the way for more reliable assessments of financial reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Although Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly used in
financial trading, it remains unclear whether they can reason and adapt in live
markets, as most studies test models instead of agents, cover limited periods
and assets, and rely on unverified data. To address these gaps, we introduce
Agent Market Arena (AMA), the first lifelong, real-time benchmark for
evaluating LLM-based trading agents across multiple markets. AMA integrates
verified trading data, expert-checked news, and diverse agent architectures
within a unified trading framework, enabling fair and continuous comparison
under real conditions. It implements four agents, including InvestorAgent as a
single-agent baseline, TradeAgent and HedgeFundAgent with different risk
styles, and DeepFundAgent with memory-based reasoning, and evaluates them
across GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, Claude-3.5-haiku, Claude-sonnet-4, and

### [234] [Demystifying Reinforcement Learning in Agentic Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11701)
*Zhaochen Yu,Ling Yang,Jiaru Zou,Shuicheng Yan,Mengdi Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates ways to enhance reinforcement learning (RL) in agentic reasoning for large language models (LLMs) by examining data, algorithms, and reasoning strategies. Key findings boost training efficiency and model performance significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the design principles and best practices for applying RL to improve agentic reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs).

Method: The study conducted experiments on RL focusing on data type, algorithm techniques, and reasoning modes. It featured innovative practices like using high-diversity datasets, exploration-friendly techniques, and deliberative reasoning strategies.

Result: The proposed practices improved agentic reasoning, training efficiency, and tool-use across four benchmarks. Smaller models (4B) achieved superior performance compared to larger models (32B), validating the effectiveness of the methods.

Conclusion: Simple, well-chosen practices in RL can significantly enhance agentic reasoning in LLMs, providing a strong foundation for future research and practical applications. Datasets and insights shared also set a new baseline for this area of study.

Abstract: Recently, the emergence of agentic RL has showcased that RL could also
effectively improve the agentic reasoning ability of LLMs, yet the key design
principles and optimal practices remain unclear. In this work, we conduct a
comprehensive and systematic investigation to demystify reinforcement learning
in agentic reasoning from three key perspectives: data, algorithm, and
reasoning mode. We highlight our key insights: (i) Replacing stitched synthetic
trajectories with real end-to-end tool-use trajectories yields a far stronger
SFT initialization; high-diversity, model-aware datasets sustain exploration
and markedly improve RL performance. (ii) Exploration-friendly techniques are
crucial for agentic RL, such as clip higher, overlong reward shaping, and
maintaining adequate policy entropy could improve the training efficiency.
(iii) A deliberative strategy with fewer tool calls outperforms frequent tool
calls or verbose self-reasoning, improving tool efficiency and final accuracy.
Together, these simple practices consistently enhance agentic reasoning and
training efficiency, achieving strong results on challenging benchmarks with
smaller models, and establishing a practical baseline for future agentic RL
research. Beyond these empirical insights, we further contribute a
high-quality, real end-to-end agentic SFT dataset along with a high-quality RL
dataset, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our insights in boosting the
agentic reasoning ability of LLMs across four challenging benchmarks, including
AIME2024/AIME2025, GPQA-Diamond, and LiveCodeBench-v6. With our recipes,
4B-sized models could also achieve superior agentic reasoning performance
compared to 32B-sized models. Code and models:

*Tsung-Han Wu,Mihran Miroyan,David M. Chan,Trevor Darrell,Narges Norouzi,Joseph E. Gonzalez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines the limitations of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) under real-world, dynamic conditions, such as interruptions and context changes, highlighting significant performance drops and unique failure modes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of the traditional static evaluation of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) and explore their robustness in dynamic, realistic scenarios.

Method: The authors evaluate state-of-the-art LRMs under two dynamic scenarios: interruptions to test partial output quality and dynamic context to assess adaptation to in-flight changes. They analyze performance across mathematical and programming benchmarks involving long-form reasoning.

Result: Static evaluations overestimate LRM robustness, with performance dropping by up to 60% under realistic conditions. Novel failure modes such as reasoning leakage, panic, and self-doubt were observed.

Conclusion: LRMs, despite excelling in static settings, face significant challenges in dynamic, real-world conditions, necessitating more robust models and testing methodologies.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at complex reasoning but are
traditionally evaluated in static, "frozen world" settings: model responses are
assumed to be instantaneous, and the context of a request is presumed to be
immutable over the duration of the response. While generally true for
short-term tasks, the "frozen world" assumption breaks down in modern reasoning
tasks such as assistive programming, where models may take hours to think
through problems and code may change dramatically from the time the model
starts thinking to the model's final output. In this work, we challenge the
frozen world assumption and evaluate LRM robustness under two realistic dynamic
scenarios: interruptions, which test the quality of the model's partial outputs
on a limited budget, and dynamic context, which tests model adaptation to
in-flight changes. Across mathematics and programming benchmarks that require
long-form reasoning, static evaluations consistently overestimate robustness:
even state-of-the-art LRMs, which achieve high accuracy in static settings, can
fail unpredictably when interrupted or exposed to changing context, with
performance dropping by up to 60% when updates are introduced late in the
reasoning process. Our analysis further reveals several novel failure modes,
including reasoning leakage, where models fold the reasoning into their final
answer when interrupted; panic, where under time pressure models abandon
reasoning entirely and return incorrect answers; and self-doubt, where
performance degrades while incorporating updated information.

TL;DR: TinyViT-Batten leverages a distilled Vision Transformer to achieve high accuracy in detecting early Batten disease from pediatric brain MRI using few-shot learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of Batten disease in pediatric patients is challenging due to subtle early MRI signs and limited training data availability.

Method: The approach includes distilling a large Vision Transformer into TinyViT (5 M-parameters) and fine-tuning it using few-shot learning with prototypical loss and 5-shot episodes.

Result: TinyViT-Batten achieves approximately 91% accuracy and AUC of at least 0.95 on a multi-site dataset of Batten disease MRIs, outperforming baseline methods.

Conclusion: TinyViT-Batten offers a sensitive, specific, and practical AI framework for early detection of Batten disease, supplemented by explainable analysis via Grad-CAM.

Abstract: Batten disease (neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis) is a rare pediatric
neurodegenerative disorder whose early MRI signs are subtle and often missed.
We propose TinyViT-Batten, a few-shot Vision Transformer (ViT) framework to
detect early Batten disease from pediatric brain MRI with limited training
cases. We distill a large teacher ViT into a 5 M-parameter TinyViT and
fine-tune it using metric-based few-shot learning (prototypical loss with
5-shot episodes). Our model achieves high accuracy (approximately 91%) and area
under ROC of at least 0.95 on a multi-site dataset of 79 genetically confirmed
Batten-disease MRIs (27 CLN3 from the Hochstein natural-history study, 32 CLN2
from an international longitudinal cohort, 12 early-manifestation CLN2 cases
reported by Cokal et al., and 8 public Radiopaedia scans) together with 90
age-matched controls, outperforming a 3D-ResNet and Swin-Tiny baseline. We
further integrate Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to
highlight disease-relevant brain regions, enabling explainable predictions. The
model's small size and strong performance (sensitivity greater than 90%,
specificity approximately 90%) demonstrates a practical AI solution for early
Batten disease detection.

Conclusion: EvoCAD effectively combines LLMs and evolutionary algorithms to enhance CAD object generation, introducing innovative evaluation metrics and outperforming existing techniques.

Abstract: Combining large language models with evolutionary computation algorithms
represents a promising research direction leveraging the remarkable generative
and in-context learning capabilities of LLMs with the strengths of evolutionary
algorithms. In this work, we present EvoCAD, a method for generating
computer-aided design (CAD) objects through their symbolic representations
using vision language models and evolutionary optimization. Our method samples
multiple CAD objects, which are then optimized using an evolutionary approach
with vision language and reasoning language models. We assess our method using
GPT-4V and GPT-4o, evaluating it on the CADPrompt benchmark dataset and
comparing it to prior methods. Additionally, we introduce two new metrics based
on topological properties defined by the Euler characteristic, which capture a
form of semantic similarity between 3D objects. Our results demonstrate that
EvoCAD outperforms previous approaches on multiple metrics, particularly in
generating topologically correct objects, which can be efficiently evaluated
using our two novel metrics that complement existing spatial metrics.

### [240] [OmniSAT: Compact Action Token, Faster Auto Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09667)
*Huaihai Lyu,Chaofan Chen,Senwei Xie,Pengwei Wang,Xiansheng Chen,Shanghang Zhang,Changsheng Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Omni Swift Action Tokenizer (OmniSAT), a method to improve autoregressive Vision-Language-Action (AR VLA) model efficiency by compactly representing robot and human actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for Vision-Language-Action models face inefficiencies: diffusion-based models are computationally heavy, while AR models require long sequences, struggling with poor reconstruction and inefficient compression.

Method: OmniSAT uses B-Spline encoding for normalization, followed by multi-stage residual quantization to compress high-dimensional sequences into discrete tokens. It employs a cross-embodiment learning strategy leveraging both robot and human action patterns.

Result: OmniSAT reduces training sequence length by 6.8× and lowers entropy, achieving higher compression while maintaining reconstruction quality and enabling faster training convergence.

Conclusion: The OmniSAT model enhances AR efficiency, achieves scalable supervision using heterogeneous data, and supports better model performance in simulation and real-world robotics experiments.

Abstract: Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models can be broadly categorized into
diffusion-based and auto-regressive (AR) approaches: diffusion models capture
continuous action distributions but rely on computationally heavy iterative
denoising. In contrast, AR models enable efficient optimization and flexible
sequence construction, making them better suited for large-scale pretraining.
To further improve AR efficiency, particularly when action chunks induce
extended and high-dimensional sequences, prior work applies entropy-guided and
token-frequency techniques to shorten the sequence length. However, such
compression struggled with \textit{poor reconstruction or inefficient
compression}. Motivated by this, we introduce an Omni Swift Action Tokenizer,
which learns a compact, transferable action representation. Specifically, we
first normalize value ranges and temporal horizons to obtain a consistent
representation with B-Spline encoding. Then, we apply multi-stage residual
quantization to the position, rotation, and gripper subspaces, producing
compressed discrete tokens with coarse-to-fine granularity for each part. After
pre-training on the large-scale dataset Droid, the resulting discrete
tokenization shortens the training sequence by 6.8$\times$, and lowers the
target entropy. To further explore the potential of OmniSAT, we develop a
cross-embodiment learning strategy that builds on the unified action-pattern
space and jointly leverages robot and human demonstrations. It enables scalable
auxiliary supervision from heterogeneous egocentric videos. Across diverse
real-robot and simulation experiments, OmniSAT encompasses higher compression
while preserving reconstruction quality, enabling faster AR training
convergence and model performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes KAMamba, an innovative method for MODIS-based change detection, improving accuracies using knowledge-driven and multi-task learning approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in MODIS time series change detection, such as mixed pixels, information coupling, and background class heterogeneity.

Method: The method involves creating a knowledge-aware transition loss, a multi-task learning framework, spatial-spectral-temporal Mamba modules, and a sparse and deformable backbone for computational efficiency.

Result: The approach achieved 1.5–6% improvement in average F1 for change detection and about 2% enhancement in OA, AA, and Kappa metrics for land-use/land-cover classification.

Conclusion: KAMamba substantially improves accuracy and efficiency in MODIS data-based change detection and classification tasks over standard baselines.

Abstract: Although change detection using MODIS time series is critical for
environmental monitoring, it is a highly challenging task due to key MODIS
difficulties, e.g., mixed pixels, spatial-spectral-temporal information
coupling effect, and background class heterogeneity. This paper presents a
novel knowledge-aware Mamba (KAMamba) for enhanced MODIS change detection, with
the following contributions. First, to leverage knowledge regarding class
transitions, we design a novel knowledge-driven transition-matrix-guided
approach, leading to a knowledge-aware transition loss (KAT-loss) that can
enhance detection accuracies. Second, to improve model constraints, a
multi-task learning approach is designed, where three losses, i.e., pre-change
classification loss (PreC-loss), post-change classification loss (PostC-loss),
and change detection loss (Chg-loss) are used for improve model learning.
Third, to disentangle information coupling in MODIS time series, novel
spatial-spectral-temporal Mamba (SSTMamba) modules are designed. Last, to
improve Mamba model efficiency and remove computational cost, a sparse and
deformable Mamba (SDMamba) backbone is used in SSTMamba. On the MODIS
time-series dataset for Saskatchewan, Canada, we evaluate the method on
land-cover change detection and LULC classification; results show about 1.5-6%
gains in average F1 for change detection over baselines, and about 2%
improvements in OA, AA, and Kappa for LULC classification.

TL;DR: The paper proposes NNDM, a hybrid model combining NN-UNet and diffusion probabilistic models to improve the accuracy and robustness of brain tumor segmentation in MRI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Brain tumor segmentation models often face challenges like poor generalization, low boundary precision, and lack of data diversity. The study aims to resolve these limitations.

Method: The paper introduces NNDM, a framework integrating NN-UNet for feature extraction and diffusion probabilistic models for refining segmentation masks through iterative denoising.

Result: NNDM outperforms conventional methods such as U-Net and transformer-based models on BraTS 2021 datasets, achieving notable improvements in key segmentation metrics like Dice coefficient and Hausdorff distance.

Conclusion: The integration of deterministic networks with stochastic diffusion models in NNDM marks a promising advancement in automated brain tumor segmentation, improving precision and robustness.

Abstract: Accurate detection and segmentation of brain tumors in magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) are critical for effective diagnosis and treatment planning.
Despite advances in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as U-Net,
existing models often struggle with generalization, boundary precision, and
limited data diversity. To address these challenges, we propose NNDM (NN\_UNet
Diffusion Model)a hybrid framework that integrates the robust feature
extraction of NN-UNet with the generative capabilities of diffusion
probabilistic models. In our approach, the diffusion model progressively
refines the segmentation masks generated by NN-UNet by learning the residual
error distribution between predicted and ground-truth masks. This iterative
denoising process enables the model to correct fine structural inconsistencies
and enhance tumor boundary delineation. Experiments conducted on the BraTS 2021
datasets demonstrate that NNDM achieves superior performance compared to
conventional U-Net and transformer-based baselines, yielding improvements in
Dice coefficient and Hausdorff distance metrics. Moreover, the diffusion-guided
refinement enhances robustness across modalities and tumor subregions. The
proposed NNDM establishes a new direction for combining deterministic
segmentation networks with stochastic diffusion models, advancing the state of
the art in automated brain tumor analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for improved micro-expression recognition using two new image representations and an adaptive fusion network, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Micro-expressions are subtle yet valuable indicators of genuine emotions, crucial for applications like lie detection and emotional analysis. The study aims to enhance micro-expression recognition using innovative methods.

Method: The paper proposes two novel representations – Temporal-ranked dynamic image (emphasizes temporal progression) and Motion-intensity dynamic image (highlights subtle motions). These are integrated using an Adaptive Fusion Network (AFN) to enhance discriminative features and suppress noise.

Result: The novel method demonstrates superior performance on three datasets:
- CASME-II: 93.95% accuracy, 0.897 UF1 (new benchmark)
- SAMM: 82.47% accuracy, 0.665 UF1 (balanced class recognition)
- MMEW: 76.00% accuracy (generalization ability)

Conclusion: The proposed approach significantly improves micro-expression recognition and offers a robust foundation for future research and applications in affective computing, lie detection, and human-computer interaction.

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are subtle, transient facial changes with very low
intensity, almost imperceptible to the naked eye, yet they reveal a person
genuine emotion. They are of great value in lie detection, behavioral analysis,
and psychological assessment. This paper proposes a novel MER method with two
main contributions. First, we propose two complementary representations -
Temporal-ranked dynamic image, which emphasizes temporal progression, and
Motion-intensity dynamic image, which highlights subtle motions through a frame
reordering mechanism incorporating motion intensity. Second, we propose an
Adaptive fusion network, which automatically learns to optimally integrate
these two representations, thereby enhancing discriminative ME features while
suppressing noise. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (CASME-II, SAMM and
MMEW) demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. Specifically, AFN
achieves 93.95 Accuracy and 0.897 UF1 on CASME-II, setting a new
state-of-the-art benchmark. On SAMM, the method attains 82.47 Accuracy and
0.665 UF1, demonstrating more balanced recognition across classes. On MMEW, the
model achieves 76.00 Accuracy, further confirming its generalization ability.
The obtained results show that both the input and the proposed architecture
play important roles in improving the performance of MER. Moreover, they
provide a solid foundation for further research and practical applications in
the fields of affective computing, lie detection, and human-computer
interaction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the lack of integrated reviews on MVMC data within CVS applications, highlighting challenges in dynamic environments and gaps in current research, such as occlusions, diverse viewpoints, and environmental variability.

Method: The authors propose a novel taxonomy for CVS, divide the system into four parts (tracking, Re-ID, AU, and combined methods), and systematically review state-of-the-art datasets, methodologies, evaluation metrics, and challenges.

Result: The paper organizes key information about MVMC tracking, Re-ID, AU, and their combination, while identifying open questions like privacy, lifelong learning, and federated learning.

Conclusion: It outlines future research directions for improving CVS's robustness, efficiency, and adaptability, aiming to inspire innovative solutions and advancements in the field.

Abstract: Connected Vision Systems (CVS) are transforming a variety of applications,
including autonomous vehicles, smart cities, surveillance, and human-robot
interaction. These systems harness multi-view multi-camera (MVMC) data to
provide enhanced situational awareness through the integration of MVMC
tracking, re-identification (Re-ID), and action understanding (AU). However,
deploying CVS in real-world, dynamic environments presents a number of
challenges, particularly in addressing occlusions, diverse viewpoints, and
environmental variability. Existing surveys have focused primarily on isolated
tasks such as tracking, Re-ID, and AU, often neglecting their integration into
a cohesive system. These reviews typically emphasize single-view setups,
overlooking the complexities and opportunities provided by multi-camera
collaboration and multi-view data analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this
survey is the first to offer a comprehensive and integrated review of MVMC that
unifies MVMC tracking, Re-ID, and AU into a single framework. We propose a
unique taxonomy to better understand the critical components of CVS, dividing
it into four key parts: MVMC tracking, Re-ID, AU, and combined methods. We
systematically arrange and summarize the state-of-the-art datasets,
methodologies, results, and evaluation metrics, providing a structured view of
the field's progression. Furthermore, we identify and discuss the open research
questions and challenges, along with emerging technologies such as lifelong
learning, privacy, and federated learning, that need to be addressed for future
advancements. The paper concludes by outlining key research directions for
enhancing the robustness, efficiency, and adaptability of CVS in complex,
real-world applications. We hope this survey will inspire innovative solutions
and guide future research toward the next generation of intelligent and
adaptive CVS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study introduces AttWarp, a method to enhance multimodal large language models' fine-grained understanding of cluttered scenes by redistributing spatial resolution in images based on relevance, improving their accuracy and reasoning without altering model architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal large language models often struggle with identifying small details and spatial relationships in cluttered scenes, leading to errors in fine-grained perceptual tasks.

Method: The approach, AttWarp, utilizes an MLLM's cross-modal attention to warp the input image spatially, reallocating resolution to more relevant regions while compressing less informative areas at test time. This preserves global context and uses non-uniform redistribution without altering model weights or architecture.

Result: AttWarp demonstrated consistent performance improvements across five benchmarks (TextVQA, GQA, DocVQA, POPE, MMMU) and four MLLMs (LLaVA, Qwen-VL, InternVL, InstructBLIP). It enhanced accuracy, compositional reasoning, and reduced hallucinations when compared to four competitive baselines.

Conclusion: Attention-guided warping effectively prioritizes query-relevant information while preserving the overall image context, allowing MLLMs to perform better with the same architecture when provided with warped inputs.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often miss small details and spatial
relations in cluttered scenes, leading to errors in fine-grained perceptual
grounding. We introduce AttWarp, a lightweight method that allocates more
resolution to query-relevant content while compressing less informative areas,
all while preserving global context. At test time, the approach uses an MLLM's
cross-modal attention to perform rectilinear warping of the input image,
reallocating spatial resolution toward regions the model deems important,
without changing model weights or architecture. This attention-guided warping
preserves all original image information but redistributes it non-uniformly, so
small objects and subtle relationships become easier for the same model to read
while the global layout remains intact. Across five benchmarks (TextVQA, GQA,
DocVQA, POPE, MMMU) and four MLLMs (LLaVA, Qwen-VL, InternVL, and
InstructBLIP), AttWarp consistently improves accuracy, strengthens
compositional reasoning, and reduces hallucinations, outperforming four
competitive baselines that manipulate raw images at test time. Together, these
results show that attention-guided warping prioritizes information relevant to
the query while preserving context, and that the same MLLMs perform better when
given such warped inputs.

TL;DR: The paper explores foreign language learning with multimodal contexts, examining human and AI ability to infer word meaning from images and sentences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how multimodal cues in foreign language learning aid the inference of word meanings and to identify predictive features for success.

Method: Conducted human participant studies analyzing image-text features and language backgrounds, alongside evaluating AI systems' reasoning abilities in the same task.

Result: Some intuitive features strongly correlate with task performance; gaps identified in predictive features and AI reasoning abilities.

Conclusion: The study highlights promising directions for improving AI capabilities and enhancing multimodal foreign language learning mechanisms.

Abstract: We investigate a new setting for foreign language learning, where learners
infer the meaning of unfamiliar words in a multimodal context of a sentence
describing a paired image. We conduct studies with human participants using
different image-text pairs. We analyze the features of the data (i.e., images
and texts) that make it easier for participants to infer the meaning of a
masked or unfamiliar word, and what language backgrounds of the participants
correlate with success. We find only some intuitive features have strong
correlations with participant performance, prompting the need for further
investigating of predictive features for success in these tasks. We also
analyze the ability of AI systems to reason about participant performance, and
discover promising future directions for improving this reasoning ability.

### [247] [Task-Aware Resolution Optimization for Visual Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09822)
*Weiqing Luo,Zhen Tan,Yifan Li,Xinyu Zhao,Kwonjoon Lee,Behzad Dariush,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies the limitations of fixed image resolutions in visual large language models (VLLMs) like LLaVA and proposes methods to optimize resolution settings and fine-tune these models efficiently for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLLMs assume fixed visual resolutions for downstream tasks, which result in reduced performance. The paper aims to address this limitation by studying the relationship between resolution preferences and vision-language task parameters.

Method: The authors analyze resolution preferences for vision-language tasks and propose an empirical formula to determine optimal resolutions based on image complexity and model uncertainty variance. They also introduce a fine-tuning method to adjust VLLMs for these optimal resolutions.

Result: Their approach is validated through comprehensive experiments, which show improved performance on multiple vision-language tasks.

Conclusion: The study establishes the importance of adapting input image resolution in VLLMs and presents solutions to improve task performance through careful resolution selection and fine-tuning.

Abstract: Real-world vision-language applications demand varying levels of perceptual
granularity. However, most existing visual large language models (VLLMs), such
as LLaVA, pre-assume a fixed resolution for downstream tasks, which leads to
subpar performance. To address this problem, we first conduct a comprehensive
and pioneering investigation into the resolution preferences of different
vision-language tasks, revealing a correlation between resolution preferences
with image complexity, and uncertainty variance of the VLLM at different image
input resolutions. Building on this insight, we propose an empirical formula to
determine the optimal resolution for a given vision-language task, combining
these two factors. Second, based on rigorous experiments, we propose a novel
parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique to extend the visual input resolution
of pre-trained VLLMs to the identified optimal resolution. Extensive
experiments on various vision-language tasks validate the effectiveness of our
method.

*Aashish Dhawan,Pankaj Bodani,Vishal Garg*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores multiple Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) to identify the best approach for improving segmentation quality on low-quality Satellite imagery and high-quality Aerial photographs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Segmentation outputs are often unclear in Satellite images due to low-quality features, necessitating better techniques to improve clarity.

Method: The study involves experimenting with different types of CRFs and assessing their performance on two datasets—low-quality Satellite imagery and high-quality Aerial photographs—to understand suitability.

Result: The experimentation revealed the pitfalls and potential of various CRFs, leading to insights on which CRF delivers optimal segmentation results for the studied datasets.

Conclusion: Using CRFs can enhance image segmentation, but their effectiveness varies depending on image quality and dataset type. The findings provide better clarity on CRF suitability for specific image segmentation tasks.

Abstract: The output of image the segmentation process is usually not very clear due to
low quality features of Satellite images. The purpose of this study is to find
a suitable Conditional Random Field (CRF) to achieve better clarity in a
segmented image. We started with different types of CRFs and studied them as to
why they are or are not suitable for our purpose. We evaluated our approach on
two different datasets - Satellite imagery having low quality features and high
quality Aerial photographs. During the study we experimented with various CRFs
to find which CRF gives the best results on images and compared our results on
these datasets to show the pitfalls and potentials of different approaches.

*David Benavente-Rios,Juan Ruiz Rodriguez,Gustavo Gatica*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores enhancing Single-Morphing Attack Detection (S-MAD) using synthetic face data while addressing dataset limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of large-scale bona fide face datasets caused by privacy concerns and improve S-MAD performance.

Method: Used morphing tools, cross-dataset evaluations, controlled synthetic image addition, and an incremental testing protocol to analyze performance.

Result: Controlled integration of synthetic data improves generalization. Indiscriminate use degrades performance. Sole reliance on synthetic data gives the highest EER but is not ideal for practical use.

Conclusion: Enhanced S-MAD depends on strategically adding synthetic and bona fide images; full reliance on synthetic data underperforms in real scenarios.

Abstract: This paper investigates the use of synthetic face data to enhance
Single-Morphing Attack Detection (S-MAD), addressing the limitations of
availability of large-scale datasets of bona fide images due to privacy
concerns. Various morphing tools and cross-dataset evaluation schemes were
utilized to conduct this study. An incremental testing protocol was implemented
to assess the generalization capabilities as more and more synthetic images
were added. The results of the experiments show that generalization can be
improved by carefully incorporating a controlled number of synthetic images
into existing datasets or by gradually adding bona fide images during training.
However, indiscriminate use of synthetic data can lead to sub-optimal
performance. Evenmore, the use of only synthetic data (morphed and non-morphed
images) achieves the highest Equal Error Rate (EER), which means in operational
scenarios the best option is not relying only on synthetic data for S-MAD.

### [250] [Cell Instance Segmentation: The Devil Is in the Boundaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09848)
*Peixian Liang,Yifan Ding,Yizhe Zhang,Jianxu Chen,Hao Zheng,Hongxiao Wang,Yejia Zhang,Guangyu Meng,Tim Weninger,Michael Niemier,X. Sharon Hu,Danny Z Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces a novel cell instance segmentation method, Ceb, which improves pixel clustering by leveraging cell boundary features for accurate segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current cell segmentation methods primarily focus on pixel-wise objectives, potentially losing critical geometric properties (e.g., shape, curvature, convexity) needed for accurate segmentation.

Method: The new method, named Ceb, designs a workflow utilizing boundary features: 1) extracts potential boundaries using a revised Watershed algorithm, 2) constructs boundary signatures by sampling pixels, 3) uses a classifier to determine boundary labels, and 4) merges or divides regions based on these labels.

Result: Ceb outperforms existing pixel clustering methods and is competitive with state-of-the-art cell instance segmentation methods across six datasets.

Conclusion: Leveraging boundary features provides improved cell instance segmentation, emphasizing the importance of geometric properties and demonstrating Ceb's superior performance.

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for cell instance segmentation are based on
deep learning (DL) semantic segmentation approaches, focusing on distinguishing
foreground pixels from background pixels. In order to identify cell instances
from foreground pixels (e.g., pixel clustering), most methods decompose
instance information into pixel-wise objectives, such as distances to
foreground-background boundaries (distance maps), heat gradients with the
center point as heat source (heat diffusion maps), and distances from the
center point to foreground-background boundaries with fixed angles (star-shaped
polygons). However, pixel-wise objectives may lose significant geometric
properties of the cell instances, such as shape, curvature, and convexity,
which require a collection of pixels to represent. To address this challenge,
we present a novel pixel clustering method, called Ceb (for Cell boundaries),
to leverage cell boundary features and labels to divide foreground pixels into
cell instances. Starting with probability maps generated from semantic
segmentation, Ceb first extracts potential foreground-foreground boundaries
with a revised Watershed algorithm. For each boundary candidate, a boundary
feature representation (called boundary signature) is constructed by sampling
pixels from the current foreground-foreground boundary as well as the
neighboring background-foreground boundaries. Next, a boundary classifier is
used to predict its binary boundary label based on the corresponding boundary
signature. Finally, cell instances are obtained by dividing or merging
neighboring regions based on the predicted boundary labels. Extensive
experiments on six datasets demonstrate that Ceb outperforms existing pixel
clustering methods on semantic segmentation probability maps. Moreover, Ceb
achieves highly competitive performance compared to SOTA cell instance
segmentation methods.

### [251] [Cluster-Aware Prompt Ensemble Learning for Few-Shot Vision-Language Model Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09867)
*Zhi Chen,Xin Yu,Xiaohui Tao,Yan Li,Zi Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Cluster-Aware Prompt Ensemble Learning (CAPEL) framework to improve vision-language models' performance by optimizing prompt ensembling and ensuring class cluster preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need arises from limitations in traditional prompt ensembling methods for VLMs, where feature averaging leads to suboptimal class centroids and accuracy.

Method: CAPEL ensembles context prompts in classification logits space, applies cluster-preserving regularization to maintain prompt distinctiveness, and uses adaptive prompt weighting for robust task performance.

Result: The proposed CAPEL framework addresses the shortcomings of traditional techniques, offering improved adaptability and accuracy across tasks and datasets.

Conclusion: CAPEL enhances zero-shot transfer in vision-language models by preserving class cluster distributions and improving prompt specialization and weighting.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP achieve zero-shot transfer across
various tasks by pre-training on numerous image-text pairs. These models often
benefit from using an ensemble of context prompts to represent a class. Despite
being effective, conventional prompt ensembling that averages textual features
of context prompts often yields suboptimal results. This is because feature
averaging shifts the class centroids away from the true class distribution. To
address this issue, we propose the Cluster-Aware Prompt Ensemble Learning
(CAPEL) framework, which preserves the cluster nature of context prompts. CAPEL
classifies images into one of several class clusters, each represented by a
distinct prompt. Instead of ensembling prompts in the feature space, we perform
ensembling in the classification logits space, aligning better with the visual
feature distribution. To further optimize prompt fine-tuning while maintaining
cluster-specific discriminative power, we introduce a cluster-preserving
regularization term. This ensures that prompts remain distinct and specialized
for different clusters, preventing collapse into a uniform direction.
Additionally, we integrate an adaptive prompt weighting technique to
dynamically adjust the attention weights for flawed or ambiguous prompts,
ensuring robust performance across diverse datasets and tasks.

### [252] [Fast Self-Supervised depth and mask aware Association for Multi-Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09878)
*Milad Khanchi,Maria Amer,Charalambos Poullis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a multi-object tracking (MOT) method using depth maps and segmentation masks to refine object tracking without employing computationally expensive IoU calculations for segmentation masks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MOT methods relying on IoU for object association perform poorly with similar or occluded objects, and computing segmentation mask IoU is resource-intensive.

Method: Depth and mask features are fused and passed through a self-supervised trained encoder for stable object representations. Depth maps are obtained from a zero-shot depth estimator, and object masks from a promptable visual segmentation model.

Result: The proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art tracking-by-detection (TBD) methods on challenging benchmarks like SportsMOT and DanceTrack, while remaining competitive on simpler benchmarks like MOT17.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates robust performance improvements in MOT, particularly in complex scenarios, by leveraging self-supervised encoders and avoiding expensive mask IoU calculations.

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) methods often rely on Intersection-over-Union
(IoU) for association. However, this becomes unreliable when objects are
similar or occluded. Also, computing IoU for segmentation masks is
computationally expensive. In this work, we use segmentation masks to capture
object shapes, but we do not compute segmentation IoU. Instead, we fuse depth
and mask features and pass them through a compact encoder trained
self-supervised. This encoder produces stable object representations, which we
use as an additional similarity cue alongside bounding box IoU and
re-identification features for matching. We obtain depth maps from a zero-shot
depth estimator and object masks from a promptable visual segmentation model to
obtain fine-grained spatial cues. Our MOT method is the first to use the
self-supervised encoder to refine segmentation masks without computing masks
IoU. MOT can be divided into joint detection-ReID (JDR) and
tracking-by-detection (TBD) models. The latter are computationally more
efficient. Experiments of our TBD method on challenging benchmarks with
non-linear motion, occlusion, and crowded scenes, such as SportsMOT and
DanceTrack, show that our method outperforms the TBD state-of-the-art on most
metrics, while achieving competitive performance on simpler benchmarks with
linear motion, such as MOT17.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a large-scale UGC-HDR video quality assessment dataset (CHUG) to address unique real-world challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growth of UGC-HDR videos on platforms like YouTube creates a need for quality assessment due to diverse distortions, but existing datasets focus on professionally generated content.

Method: The CHUG dataset includes 856 UGC-HDR source videos, transcoded to 5,992 videos with varied resolutions and bitrates, and 211,848 perceptual ratings were collected via crowdsourcing on Amazon Mechanical Turk.

Result: CHUG is a diverse and large-scale dataset offering benchmarks for UGC-specific distortions in HDR videos.

Conclusion: CHUG advances NR HDR video quality research and provides an open, extensive resource for the community to analyze UGC HDR video distortions.

Abstract: High Dynamic Range (HDR) videos enhance visual experiences with superior
brightness, contrast, and color depth. The surge of User-Generated Content
(UGC) on platforms like YouTube and TikTok introduces unique challenges for HDR
video quality assessment (VQA) due to diverse capture conditions, editing
artifacts, and compression distortions. Existing HDR-VQA datasets primarily
focus on professionally generated content (PGC), leaving a gap in understanding
real-world UGC-HDR degradations. To address this, we introduce CHUG:
Crowdsourced User-Generated HDR Video Quality Dataset, the first large-scale
subjective study on UGC-HDR quality. CHUG comprises 856 UGC-HDR source videos,
transcoded across multiple resolutions and bitrates to simulate real-world
scenarios, totaling 5,992 videos. A large-scale study via Amazon Mechanical
Turk collected 211,848 perceptual ratings. CHUG provides a benchmark for
analyzing UGC-specific distortions in HDR videos. We anticipate CHUG will
advance No-Reference (NR) HDR-VQA research by offering a large-scale, diverse,
and real-world UGC dataset. The dataset is publicly available at:

*Minkwan Kim,Changwoon Choi,Young Min Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces scene-adaptive strategies to enhance immersive indoor environment rendering while optimizing computational resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Indoor scenes with complex layouts and irregularities require efficient allocation of representation capacity for rendering immersive experiences.

Method: They leverage geometric priors from pre-processed data to guide the placement of bases and propose adaptive virtual viewpoints to improve scalability and quality.

Result: The proposed approach significantly improves rendering quality and optimizes memory usage compared to existing methods with uniform basis arrangements.

Conclusion: Scene-adaptive strategies, using geometric priors and adaptive viewpoints, enhance both rendering efficiency and quality for large-scale indoor environments.

Abstract: We propose scene-adaptive strategies to efficiently allocate representation
capacity for generating immersive experiences of indoor environments from
incomplete observations. Indoor scenes with multiple rooms often exhibit
irregular layouts with varying complexity, containing clutter, occlusion, and
flat walls. We maximize the utilization of limited resources with guidance from
geometric priors, which are often readily available after pre-processing
stages. We record observation statistics on the estimated geometric scaffold
and guide the optimal placement of bases, which greatly improves upon the
uniform basis arrangements adopted by previous scalable Neural Radiance Field
(NeRF) representations. We also suggest scene-adaptive virtual viewpoints to
compensate for geometric deficiencies inherent in view configurations in the
input trajectory and impose the necessary regularization. We present a
comprehensive analysis and discussion regarding rendering quality and memory
requirements in several large-scale indoor scenes, demonstrating significant
enhancements compared to baselines that employ regular placements.

*Minkwan Kim,Seungmin Lee,Junho Kim,Young Min Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces "LTGS," a framework for efficiently modeling long-term changes in 3D scenes from sparse and casual image captures, enabling high-quality and scalable temporal reconstructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind the paper is to address challenges in novel-view synthesis for casual captures of real-world environments, particularly when handling frequent scene changes and sparse observations.

Method: The authors propose 'LTGS,' a scene representation based on Gaussian splatting. It utilizes template Gaussians as reusable structural priors for objects, which can be refined and adapted to temporal changes through few-shot learning and simple transformations.

Result: LTGS allows for efficient updates and accurate reconstructions of evolving 3D scenes, performing better than existing methods. The framework was evaluated with real-world datasets collected by the authors, demonstrating superior scalability and reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: The proposed LTGS framework offers a robust solution for sparse-view scene capture and reconstruction in dynamic environments, ensuring practicality for real-world applications and enabling lightweight updates on temporal scene variations.

Abstract: Recent advances in novel-view synthesis can create the photo-realistic
visualization of real-world environments from conventional camera captures.
However, acquiring everyday environments from casual captures faces challenges
due to frequent scene changes, which require dense observations both spatially
and temporally. We propose long-term Gaussian scene chronology from sparse-view
updates, coined LTGS, an efficient scene representation that can embrace
everyday changes from highly under-constrained casual captures. Given an
incomplete and unstructured Gaussian splatting representation obtained from an
initial set of input images, we robustly model the long-term chronology of the
scene despite abrupt movements and subtle environmental variations. We
construct objects as template Gaussians, which serve as structural, reusable
priors for shared object tracks. Then, the object templates undergo a further
refinement pipeline that modulates the priors to adapt to temporally varying
environments based on few-shot observations. Once trained, our framework is
generalizable across multiple time steps through simple transformations,
significantly enhancing the scalability for a temporal evolution of 3D
environments. As existing datasets do not explicitly represent the long-term
real-world changes with a sparse capture setup, we collect real-world datasets
to evaluate the practicality of our pipeline. Experiments demonstrate that our
framework achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to other baselines
while enabling fast and light-weight updates.

*Lenny Aharon,Keemin Lee,Karan Sikka,Selmaan Chettih,Cole Hurwitz,Liam Paninski,Matthew R Whiteway*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework for multi-view animal pose estimation, which improves accuracy with limited labeled data by combining novel training, post-processing methods, and model distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches face challenges with limited labeled data and poor uncertainty estimates during multi-view animal pose estimation.

Method: The framework leverages multi-view transformers (MVTs) with pretrained backbones, patch masking for cross-view correspondences without calibration, 3D augmentation for geometric consistency, a nonlinear Ensemble Kalman Smoother, and a model distillation procedure with pseudo-labels to reduce manual labeling.

Result: The proposed methods outperform existing techniques across three animal species and provide complementary benefits, enabling better behavioral analysis.

Conclusion: The system offers reliable, uncertainty-aware pose estimation suitable for real-world constraints, supporting scientific research and behavioral studies.

Abstract: Multi-view pose estimation is essential for quantifying animal behavior in
scientific research, yet current methods struggle to achieve accurate tracking
with limited labeled data and suffer from poor uncertainty estimates. We
address these challenges with a comprehensive framework combining novel
training and post-processing techniques, and a model distillation procedure
that leverages the strengths of these techniques to produce a more efficient
and effective pose estimator. Our multi-view transformer (MVT) utilizes
pretrained backbones and enables simultaneous processing of information across
all views, while a novel patch masking scheme learns robust cross-view
correspondences without camera calibration. For calibrated setups, we
incorporate geometric consistency through 3D augmentation and a triangulation
loss. We extend the existing Ensemble Kalman Smoother (EKS) post-processor to
the nonlinear case and enhance uncertainty quantification via a variance
inflation technique. Finally, to leverage the scaling properties of the MVT, we
design a distillation procedure that exploits improved EKS predictions and
uncertainty estimates to generate high-quality pseudo-labels, thereby reducing
dependence on manual labels. Our framework components consistently outperform
existing methods across three diverse animal species (flies, mice, chickadees),
with each component contributing complementary benefits. The result is a
practical, uncertainty-aware system for reliable pose estimation that enables
downstream behavioral analyses under real-world data constraints.

TL;DR: This paper develops a deep learning architecture that integrates hyperspectral imaging (HSI) into UAV perception, improving efficiency for navigation, object detection, and environmental monitoring tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is driven by the need for UAVs to operate in complex conditions where traditional navigation fails, using HSI to enhance material recognition and object differentiation.

Method: The authors designed a hybrid 2D/3D convolutional architecture with a SpectralCA block based on the Mobile 3D Vision Transformer (MDvT) to fuse spectral and spatial features, and tested it on the WHU-Hi-HongHu dataset.

Result: The proposed architecture demonstrated enhanced accuracy, reduced parameters, and faster inference times during experimental evaluation, improving UAV-based perception tasks.

Conclusion: The deep learning model integrating HSI enables reliable and efficient UAV operation in challenging environments, with potential for real-time tasks like navigation and environmental monitoring.

Abstract: The relevance of this research lies in the growing demand for unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs) capable of operating reliably in complex environments where
conventional navigation becomes unreliable due to interference, poor
visibility, or camouflage. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides unique
opportunities for UAV-based computer vision by enabling fine-grained material
recognition and object differentiation, which are critical for navigation,
surveillance, agriculture, and environmental monitoring. The aim of this work
is to develop a deep learning architecture integrating HSI into UAV perception
for navigation, object detection, and terrain classification. Objectives
include: reviewing existing HSI methods, designing a hybrid 2D/3D convolutional
architecture with spectral-spatial cross-attention, training, and benchmarking.
The methodology is based on the modification of the Mobile 3D Vision
Transformer (MDvT) by introducing the proposed SpectralCA block. This block
employs bi-directional cross-attention to fuse spectral and spatial features,
enhancing accuracy while reducing parameters and inference time. Experimental
evaluation was conducted on the WHU-Hi-HongHu dataset, with results assessed
using Overall Accuracy, Average Accuracy, and the Kappa coefficient. The
findings confirm that the proposed architecture improves UAV perception
efficiency, enabling real-time operation for navigation, object recognition,
and environmental monitoring tasks.

*Renjie Li,Zihao Zhu,Xiaoyu Wang,Zhengzhong Tu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents HeadsUp, an end-to-end image super-resolution model designed for portrait photos, overcoming blending artifacts caused by separate models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image super-resolution methods struggle with artifacts in portrait photos due to separate models for face and general image regions.

Method: HeadsUp uses a single-step diffusion model, enhanced with a face supervision mechanism and reference-based system for identity restoration.

Result: Experiments demonstrate HeadsUp's superior performance in seamlessly upscaling and restoring portrait photos, and in general image and aligned face datasets.

Conclusion: HeadsUp provides a more efficient and accurate solution for portrait image super-resolution, resolving blending and boundary artifact issues.

Abstract: Portrait pictures, which typically feature both human subjects and natural
backgrounds, are one of the most prevalent forms of photography on social
media. Existing image super-resolution (ISR) techniques generally focus either
on generic real-world images or strictly aligned facial images (i.e., face
super-resolution). In practice, separate models are blended to handle portrait
photos: the face specialist model handles the face region, and the general
model processes the rest. However, these blending approaches inevitably
introduce blending or boundary artifacts around the facial regions due to
different model training recipes, while human perception is particularly
sensitive to facial fidelity. To overcome these limitations, we study the
portrait image supersolution (PortraitISR) problem, and propose HeadsUp, a
single-step diffusion model that is capable of seamlessly restoring and
upscaling portrait images in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, we build our
model on top of a single-step diffusion model and develop a face supervision
mechanism to guide the model in focusing on the facial region. We then
integrate a reference-based mechanism to help with identity restoration,
reducing face ambiguity in low-quality face restoration. Additionally, we have
built a high-quality 4K portrait image ISR dataset dubbed PortraitSR-4K, to
support model training and benchmarking for portrait images. Extensive
experiments show that HeadsUp achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
PortraitISR task while maintaining comparable or higher performance on both
general image and aligned face datasets.

*Nilesh Jain,Elie Alhajjar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenges in underwater image quality, proposing the use of denoising diffusion models for dataset diversity and ControlNet for image enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater images are crucial for marine ecosystem research but suffer from poor quality and lack of diverse datasets.

Method: The authors propose expanding datasets with a denoising diffusion model for diverse image types and using ControlNet for image enhancement.

Result: The approach improves dataset quality and representation of various lighting conditions and angles.

Conclusion: Implementing these methods will enhance underwater image analysis, aiding better marine ecosystem studies.

Abstract: Underwater images play a crucial role in ocean research and marine
environmental monitoring since they provide quality information about the
ecosystem. However, the complex and remote nature of the environment results in
poor image quality with issues such as low visibility, blurry textures, color
distortion, and noise. In recent years, research in image enhancement has
proven to be effective but also presents its own limitations, like poor
generalization and heavy reliance on clean datasets. One of the challenges
herein is the lack of diversity and the low quality of images included in these
datasets. Also, most existing datasets consist only of monocular images, a fact
that limits the representation of different lighting conditions and angles. In
this paper, we propose a new plan of action to overcome these limitations. On
one hand, we call for expanding the datasets using a denoising diffusion model
to include a variety of image types such as stereo, wide-angled, macro, and
close-up images. On the other hand, we recommend enhancing the images using
Controlnet to evaluate and increase the quality of the corresponding datasets,
and hence improve the study of the marine ecosystem.

*Agampreet Aulakh,Nils D. Forkert,Matthias Wilms*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel method leveraging Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) to model brain aging trajectories using MRI data, achieving higher accuracy than traditional deep learning approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for analyzing longitudinal neuroimaging data are limited in representing continuous biological processes, especially with irregular spatial and temporal sampling.

Method: The authors design an INR framework that disentangles spatial and temporal parameters to represent continuous aging trajectories and classify brain aging patterns based on these representations.

Result: Their INR-based method achieves an accuracy of 81.3% in classifying brain aging trajectories using irregularly sampled MRI data, outperforming a traditional deep learning baseline with 73.7% accuracy.

Conclusion: INRs provide a powerful alternative for modeling continuous biological processes in brain aging, showing promise for improved classification and analytical performance over traditional methods.

Abstract: The human brain undergoes dynamic, potentially pathology-driven, structural
changes throughout a lifespan. Longitudinal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
and other neuroimaging data are valuable for characterizing trajectories of
change associated with typical and atypical aging. However, the analysis of
such data is highly challenging given their discrete nature with different
spatial and temporal image sampling patterns within individuals and across
populations. This leads to computational problems for most traditional deep
learning methods that cannot represent the underlying continuous biological
process. To address these limitations, we present a new, fully data-driven
method for representing aging trajectories across the entire brain by modelling
subject-specific longitudinal T1-weighted MRI data as continuous functions
using Implicit Neural Representations (INRs). Therefore, we introduce a novel
INR architecture capable of partially disentangling spatial and temporal
trajectory parameters and design an efficient framework that directly operates
on the INRs' parameter space to classify brain aging trajectories. To evaluate
our method in a controlled data environment, we develop a biologically grounded
trajectory simulation and generate T1-weighted 3D MRI data for 450 healthy and
dementia-like subjects at regularly and irregularly sampled timepoints. In the
more realistic irregular sampling experiment, our INR-based method achieves
81.3% accuracy for the brain aging trajectory classification task,
outperforming a standard deep learning baseline model (73.7%).

*Pouya Shaeri,Ryan T. Woo,Yasaman Mohammadpour,Ariane Middel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a human-in-the-loop framework for enhancing segmentation models' robustness and generalization through targeted interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Segmentation models struggle in real-world domains due to reliance on spurious correlations rather than true object features, necessitating a method to improve robustness and generalization.

Method: A human-in-the-loop interactive system that uses human corrections as interventional signals to refine the model, propagating these corrections across similar images and improving robustness to dataset artifacts.

Result: The proposed framework improves segmentation accuracy by up to 9 mIoU points on challenging datasets, reduces annotation effort by 3-4 times compared to retraining, and maintains competitive benchmark performance.

Conclusion: This framework addresses segmentation model bias, enhances generalization to new domains, and achieves high efficiency and robustness, benefiting tasks like urban climate monitoring and autonomous driving.

Abstract: Segmentation models achieve high accuracy on benchmarks but often fail in
real-world domains by relying on spurious correlations instead of true object
boundaries. We propose a human-in-the-loop interactive framework that enables
interventional learning through targeted human corrections of segmentation
outputs. Our approach treats human corrections as interventional signals that
show when reliance on superficial features (e.g., color or texture) is
inappropriate. The system learns from these interventions by propagating
correction-informed edits across visually similar images, effectively steering
the model toward robust, semantically meaningful features rather than
dataset-specific artifacts. Unlike traditional annotation approaches that
simply provide more training data, our method explicitly identifies when and
why the model fails and then systematically corrects these failure modes across
the entire dataset. Through iterative human feedback, the system develops
increasingly robust representations that generalize better to novel domains and
resist artifactual correlations. We demonstrate that our framework improves
segmentation accuracy by up to 9 mIoU points (12-15\% relative improvement) on

*Pan Wang,Yihao Hu,Xiaodong Bai,Aiping Yang,Xiangxiang Li,Meiping Ding,Jianguo Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenges in detecting Shatian pomelo by proposing a multi-strategy detection framework leveraging a specialized dataset, unique data augmentations, and a novel detection network.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate detection of Shatian pomelo is critical for meeting commercial demands and ensuring lean production, but current methods degrade under real-world conditions.

Method: The study introduces the STP-AgriData dataset, data augmentations catering to varying imaging conditions, and the REAS-Det network featuring modules for addressing scale and occlusion variations.

Result: Achieved precision of 87.6%, recall of 74.9%, mAP@.50 of 82.8%, and mAP@.50:.95 of 53.3%, outperforming state-of-the-art detection methods.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-strategy framework effectively addresses imaging, lighting, scale, and occlusion issues, offering a superior solution for Shatian pomelo detection in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: As a specialty agricultural product with a large market scale, Shatian pomelo
necessitates the adoption of automated detection to ensure accurate quantity
and meet commercial demands for lean production. Existing research often
involves specialized networks tailored for specific theoretical or dataset
scenarios, but these methods tend to degrade performance in real-world. Through
analysis of factors in this issue, this study identifies four key challenges
that affect the accuracy of Shatian pomelo detection: imaging devices, lighting
conditions, object scale variation, and occlusion. To mitigate these
challenges, a multi-strategy framework is proposed in this paper. Firstly, to
effectively solve tone variation introduced by diverse imaging devices and
complex orchard environments, we utilize a multi-scenario dataset,
STP-AgriData, which is constructed by integrating real orchard images with
internet-sourced data. Secondly, to simulate the inconsistent illumination
conditions, specific data augmentations such as adjusting contrast and changing
brightness, are applied to the above dataset. Thirdly, to address the issues of
object scale variation and occlusion in fruit detection, an REAS-Det network is
designed in this paper. For scale variation, RFAConv and C3RFEM modules are
designed to expand and enhance the receptive fields. For occlusion variation, a
multi-scale, multi-head feature selection structure (MultiSEAM) and soft-NMS
are introduced to enhance the handling of occlusion issues to improve detection
accuracy. The results of these experiments achieved a precision(P) of 87.6%, a
recall (R) of 74.9%, a mAP@.50 of 82.8%, and a mAP@.50:.95 of 53.3%. Our
proposed network demonstrates superior performance compared to other
state-of-the-art detection methods.

### [263] [J-RAS: Enhancing Medical Image Segmentation via Retrieval-Augmented Joint Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09953)
*Salma J. Ahmed,Emad A. Mohammed,Azam Asilian Bidgoli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces J-RAS, a joint training method integrating segmentation and retrieval models to improve medical image segmentation, validated with substantial performance gains using benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the automation of medical image segmentation, which is critical for healthcare but currently limited by the need for large, annotated datasets and difficulties in generalizing across diverse conditions.

Method: Joint training of a segmentation model and a retrieval model, where the retrieval model provides segmentation-relevant contextual cues and both models are optimized together to enhance anatomical understanding and boundary delineation.

Result: Validated improvements across multiple segmentation models on ACDC and M&Ms datasets, such as significant increases in mean Dice scores and decreases in Hausdorff Distance, showcasing the method’s effectiveness.

Conclusion: J-RAS improves segmentation performance and generalizability across architectures and datasets, addressing limitations in current AI-based medical image segmentation methods.

Abstract: Image segmentation, the process of dividing images into meaningful regions,
is critical in medical applications for accurate diagnosis, treatment planning,
and disease monitoring. Although manual segmentation by healthcare
professionals produces precise outcomes, it is time-consuming, costly, and
prone to variability due to differences in human expertise. Artificial
intelligence (AI)-based methods have been developed to address these
limitations by automating segmentation tasks; however, they often require
large, annotated datasets that are rarely available in practice and frequently
struggle to generalize across diverse imaging conditions due to inter-patient
variability and rare pathological cases. In this paper, we propose Joint
Retrieval Augmented Segmentation (J-RAS), a joint training method for guided
image segmentation that integrates a segmentation model with a retrieval model.
Both models are jointly optimized, enabling the segmentation model to leverage
retrieved image-mask pairs to enrich its anatomical understanding, while the
retrieval model learns segmentation-relevant features beyond simple visual
similarity. This joint optimization ensures that retrieval actively contributes
meaningful contextual cues to guide boundary delineation, thereby enhancing the
overall segmentation performance. We validate J-RAS across multiple
segmentation backbones, including U-Net, TransUNet, SAM, and SegFormer, on two
benchmark datasets: ACDC and M&Ms, demonstrating consistent improvements. For
example, on the ACDC dataset, SegFormer without J-RAS achieves a mean Dice
score of 0.8708$\pm$0.042 and a mean Hausdorff Distance (HD) of
1.8130$\pm$2.49, whereas with J-RAS, the performance improves substantially to
a mean Dice score of 0.9115$\pm$0.031 and a mean HD of 1.1489$\pm$0.30. These
results highlight the method's effectiveness and its generalizability across
architectures and datasets.

*Fan Zuo,Donglin Zhou,Jingqin Gao,Kaan Ozbay*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an AI framework utilizing traffic cameras for scalable traffic monitoring to address challenges in installation and data management costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for cost-effective and scalable ways to monitor traffic, especially during disruptions like natural disasters or policy changes.

Method: The method includes fine-tuning a YOLOv11 model for traffic density analysis, introducing a graph-based viewpoint normalization method, and integrating a domain-specific language model to analyze video streams.

Result: Testing on 9 million images showed a 9% decline in passenger vehicle density in NYC congestion zones, changes in truck volume, and increased cyclist and pedestrian activity.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a scalable, infrastructure-ready solution for effective traffic monitoring with minimal human input.

Abstract: Accurate, scalable traffic monitoring is critical for real-time and long-term
transportation management, particularly during disruptions such as natural
disasters, large construction projects, or major policy changes like New York
City's first-in-the-nation congestion pricing program. However, widespread
sensor deployment remains limited due to high installation, maintenance, and
data management costs. While traffic cameras offer a cost-effective
alternative, existing video analytics struggle with dynamic camera viewpoints
and massive data volumes from large camera networks. This study presents an
end-to-end AI-based framework leveraging existing traffic camera infrastructure
for high-resolution, longitudinal analysis at scale. A fine-tuned YOLOv11
model, trained on localized urban scenes, extracts multimodal traffic density
and classification metrics in real time. To address inconsistencies from
non-stationary pan-tilt-zoom cameras, we introduce a novel graph-based
viewpoint normalization method. A domain-specific large language model was also
integrated to process massive data from a 24/7 video stream to generate
frequent, automated summaries of evolving traffic patterns, a task far
exceeding manual capabilities. We validated the system using over 9 million
images from roughly 1,000 traffic cameras during the early rollout of NYC
congestion pricing in 2025. Results show a 9% decline in weekday passenger
vehicle density within the Congestion Relief Zone, early truck volume
reductions with signs of rebound, and consistent increases in pedestrian and
cyclist activity at corridor and zonal scales. Experiments showed that
example-based prompts improved LLM's numerical accuracy and reduced
hallucinations. These findings demonstrate the framework's potential as a
practical, infrastructure-ready solution for large-scale, policy-relevant
traffic monitoring with minimal human intervention.

### [265] [FlareX: A Physics-Informed Dataset for Lens Flare Removal via 2D Synthesis and 3D Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09995)
*Lishen Qu,Zhihao Liu,Jinshan Pan,Shihao Zhou,Jinglei Shi,Duosheng Chen,Jufeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a physics-informed lens flare data generation method and FlareX dataset to improve model generalization for real-world lens flare scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 2D lens flare datasets lack diversity and physical accuracy, limiting model performance in real-world applications.

Method: A three-stage physics-informed data generation process: parameterized 2D template creation, illumination-aware synthesis, and physics-based 3D rendering to build the FlareX dataset.

Result: The FlareX dataset includes 9,500 2D templates from 95 patterns and 3,000 flare image pairs from 60 3D scenes. Experiments show improved model performance on real-world lens flare scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed method and FlareX dataset effectively address the limitations of prior datasets, enhancing model generalization for real-world lens flare scenarios.

Abstract: Lens flare occurs when shooting towards strong light sources, significantly
degrading the visual quality of images. Due to the difficulty in capturing
flare-corrupted and flare-free image pairs in the real world, existing datasets
are typically synthesized in 2D by overlaying artificial flare templates onto
background images. However, the lack of flare diversity in templates and the
neglect of physical principles in the synthesis process hinder models trained
on these datasets from generalizing well to real-world scenarios. To address
these challenges, we propose a new physics-informed method for flare data
generation, which consists of three stages: parameterized template creation,
the laws of illumination-aware 2D synthesis, and physical engine-based 3D
rendering, which finally gives us a mixed flare dataset that incorporates both
2D and 3D perspectives, namely FlareX. This dataset offers 9,500 2D templates
derived from 95 flare patterns and 3,000 flare image pairs rendered from 60 3D
scenes. Furthermore, we design a masking approach to obtain real-world
flare-free images from their corrupted counterparts to measure the performance
of the model on real-world images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method and dataset.

### [266] [BurstDeflicker: A Benchmark Dataset for Flicker Removal in Dynamic Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09996)
*Lishen Qu,Zhihao Liu,Shihao Zhou,Yaqi Luo,Jie Liang,Hui Zeng,Lei Zhang,Jufeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces BurstDeflicker, a benchmark dataset tackling flicker artifacts in images caused by rolling shutter cameras and AC-powered lighting. The dataset offers tools for synthetic flicker manipulation, real-world scene capture, and motion incorporation using green-screen methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the barrier in flicker-removal research caused by the lack of a realistic, large-scale flicker dataset, as flicker artifacts compromise both image quality and high-level tasks like object detection and tracking.

Method: They employ three data acquisition strategies: a synthetic flicker manipulation pipeline, real-world scene capture with 4,000 assembled images, and a green-screen approach to simulate motion paired with flicker degradation.

Result: The resulting BurstDeflicker dataset demonstrates superior effectiveness in enabling models to understand flicker artifacts better and generalize to practical scenarios.

Conclusion: BurstDeflicker advances research into flicker removal by addressing critical gaps like synthetic diversity, real-world reproduction, and motion integration, enabling more robust solutions for image quality enhancement and task reliability.

Abstract: Flicker artifacts in short-exposure images are caused by the interplay
between the row-wise exposure mechanism of rolling shutter cameras and the
temporal intensity variations of alternating current (AC)-powered lighting.
These artifacts typically appear as uneven brightness distribution across the
image, forming noticeable dark bands. Beyond compromising image quality, this
structured noise also affects high-level tasks, such as object detection and
tracking, where reliable lighting is crucial. Despite the prevalence of
flicker, the lack of a large-scale, realistic dataset has been a significant
barrier to advancing research in flicker removal. To address this issue, we
present BurstDeflicker, a scalable benchmark constructed using three
complementary data acquisition strategies. First, we develop a Retinex-based
synthesis pipeline that redefines the goal of flicker removal and enables
controllable manipulation of key flicker-related attributes (e.g., intensity,
area, and frequency), thereby facilitating the generation of diverse flicker
patterns. Second, we capture 4,000 real-world flicker images from different
scenes, which help the model better understand the spatial and temporal
characteristics of real flicker artifacts and generalize more effectively to
wild scenarios. Finally, due to the non-repeatable nature of dynamic scenes, we
propose a green-screen method to incorporate motion into image pairs while
preserving real flicker degradation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our dataset and its potential to advance research in flicker
removal.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MIMO, a medical vision-language model addressing limitations in visual understanding and grounding text answers in images by combining multimodal input and output capabilities. The dataset MIMOSeg is introduced to facilitate its training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of direct visual understanding and pixel grounding in medical vision-language models used in medical question answering tasks.

Method: The authors propose MIMO, a unified model leveraging visual referring multimodal input and pixel grounding multimodal output. Additionally, they create MIMOSeg, a comprehensive dataset with 895K samples for training and evaluation.

Result: MIMO demonstrated the ability to effectively integrate visual and textual cues for understanding medical images and semantics. Experimental results showed enhanced performance in downstream medical multimodal tasks, achieving unique capabilities like visual referring and pixel grounding.

Conclusion: MIMO breaks new ground by bridging multimodal input and output for medical vision-language tasks, addressing gaps in previous models and enhancing their application scope with the support of the novel MIMOSeg dataset.

Abstract: Currently, medical vision language models are widely used in medical vision
question answering tasks. However, existing models are confronted with two
issues: for input, the model only relies on text instructions and lacks direct
understanding of visual clues in the image; for output, the model only gives
text answers and lacks connection with key areas in the image. To address these
issues, we propose a unified medical vision language model MIMO, with visual
referring Multimodal Input and pixel grounding Multimodal Output. MIMO can not
only combine visual clues and textual instructions to understand complex
medical images and semantics, but can also ground medical terminologies in
textual output within the image. To overcome the scarcity of relevant data in
the medical field, we propose MIMOSeg, a comprehensive medical multimodal
dataset including 895K samples. MIMOSeg is constructed from four different
perspectives, covering basic instruction following and complex question
answering with multimodal input and multimodal output. We conduct experiments
on several downstream medical multimodal tasks. Extensive experimental results
verify that MIMO can uniquely combine visual referring and pixel grounding
capabilities, which are not available in previous models.

*Junan Chen,Trung Thanh Nguyen,Takahiro Komamizu,Ichiro Ide*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Q-Adapter, a lightweight visual adapter module for more efficient fine-tuning in video captioning tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome limitations in computational efficiency and visual information utilization in fine-tuning large multimodal models for video captioning tasks.

Method: The method involves introducing Q-Adapter, with learnable query tokens and a gating layer, into the Vision Encoder to extract sparse and relevant features without external supervision, optimizing parameter efficiency.

Result: Q-Adapter achieved state-of-the-art results on MSR-VTT and MSVD datasets across metrics like BLEU@4, METEOR, ROUGE-L, and CIDEr, while using only 1.4% of the parameters compared to full fine-tuning approaches.

Conclusion: The study highlights Q-Adapter's strong capability to balance caption quality and parameter efficiency, supporting its scalability for video-language modeling tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in video captioning are driven by large-scale pretrained
models, which follow the standard "pre-training followed by fine-tuning"
paradigm, where the full model is fine-tuned for downstream tasks. Although
effective, this approach becomes computationally prohibitive as the model size
increases. The Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) approach offers a
promising alternative, but primarily focuses on the language components of
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Despite recent progress, PEFT remains
underexplored in multimodal tasks and lacks sufficient understanding of visual
information during fine-tuning the model. To bridge this gap, we propose
Query-Adapter (Q-Adapter), a lightweight visual adapter module designed to
enhance MLLMs by enabling efficient fine-tuning for the video captioning task.
Q-Adapter introduces learnable query tokens and a gating layer into Vision
Encoder, enabling effective extraction of sparse, caption-relevant features
without relying on external textual supervision. We evaluate Q-Adapter on two
well-known video captioning datasets, MSR-VTT and MSVD, where it achieves
state-of-the-art performance among the methods that take the PEFT approach
across BLEU@4, METEOR, ROUGE-L, and CIDEr metrics. Q-Adapter also achieves
competitive performance compared to methods that take the full fine-tuning
approach while requiring only 1.4% of the parameters. We further analyze the
impact of key hyperparameters and design choices on fine-tuning effectiveness,
providing insights into optimization strategies for adapter-based learning.
These results highlight the strong potential of Q-Adapter in balancing caption
quality and parameter efficiency, demonstrating its scalability for
video-language modeling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces P-4DGS, a new dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting method aimed at compact 4D scene modeling by leveraging spatial-temporal redundancies and compression techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high memory consumption of existing dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting algorithms due to overlooked temporal and spatial redundancies.

Method: The authors propose a 3D anchor point-based spatial-temporal prediction module to exploit redundancies and use an adaptive quantization strategy with context-based entropy coding for compression.

Result: P-4DGS achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality, the fastest rendering speed, and significant compression (around 1MB storage), with up to 40x and 90x compression on synthetic and real-world scenes respectively.

Conclusion: P-4DGS is highly effective for compact 4D scene modeling, improving storage efficiency without compromising reconstruction quality or rendering speed.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has garnered significant attention due to its
superior scene representation fidelity and real-time rendering performance,
especially for dynamic 3D scene reconstruction (\textit{i.e.}, 4D
reconstruction). However, despite achieving promising results, most existing
algorithms overlook the substantial temporal and spatial redundancies inherent
in dynamic scenes, leading to prohibitive memory consumption. To address this,
we propose P-4DGS, a novel dynamic 3DGS representation for compact 4D scene
modeling. Inspired by intra- and inter-frame prediction techniques commonly
used in video compression, we first design a 3D anchor point-based
spatial-temporal prediction module to fully exploit the spatial-temporal
correlations across different 3D Gaussian primitives. Subsequently, we employ
an adaptive quantization strategy combined with context-based entropy coding to
further reduce the size of the 3D anchor points, thereby achieving enhanced
compression efficiency. To evaluate the rate-distortion performance of our
proposed P-4DGS in comparison with other dynamic 3DGS representations, we
conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art
reconstruction quality and the fastest rendering speed, with a remarkably low
storage footprint (around \textbf{1MB} on average), achieving up to
\textbf{40$\times$} and \textbf{90$\times$} compression on synthetic and
real-world scenes, respectively.

*Sitong Gong,Yunzhi Zhuge,Lu Zhang,Pingping Zhang,Huchuan Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CCFormer, a new Transformer-based framework for Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS), addressing limitations in prior methods and showing improved performance on several benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of prior CNN and Transformer-based methods in Audio-Visual Segmentation, particularly their struggles with capturing multimodal coefficients, temporal dynamics, and global spatial-temporal context effectively.

Method: Proposes the CCFormer framework, incorporating an Early Integration Module (EIM) for multi-scale feature fusion, a Multi-query Transformer Module (MTM) for spatial-temporal context modeling, and Bi-modal Contrastive Learning (BCL) for modality alignment.

Result: The proposed CCFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on S4, MS3, and AVSS datasets, showcasing its effectiveness in improving segmentation accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: The CCFormer provides a robust solution to current challenges in Audio-Visual Segmentation, offering both theoretical and practical advancements, and outperforms existing approaches.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) aims to generate pixel-wise segmentation maps
that correlate with the auditory signals of objects. This field has seen
significant progress with numerous CNN and Transformer-based methods enhancing
the segmentation accuracy and robustness. Traditional CNN approaches manage
audio-visual interactions through basic operations like padding and
multiplications but are restricted by CNNs' limited local receptive field. More
recently, Transformer-based methods treat auditory cues as queries, utilizing
attention mechanisms to enhance audio-visual cooperation within frames.
Nevertheless, they typically struggle to extract multimodal coefficients and
temporal dynamics adequately. To overcome these limitations, we present the
Complementary and Contrastive Transformer (CCFormer), a novel framework adept
at processing both local and global information and capturing spatial-temporal
context comprehensively. Our CCFormer initiates with the Early Integration
Module (EIM) that employs a parallel bilateral architecture, merging
multi-scale visual features with audio data to boost cross-modal
complementarity. To extract the intra-frame spatial features and facilitate the
perception of temporal coherence, we introduce the Multi-query Transformer
Module (MTM), which dynamically endows audio queries with learning capabilities
and models the frame and video-level relations simultaneously. Furthermore, we
propose the Bi-modal Contrastive Learning (BCL) to promote the alignment across
both modalities in the unified feature space. Through the effective combination
of those designs, our method sets new state-of-the-art benchmarks across the
S4, MS3 and AVSS datasets. Our source code and model weights will be made
publicly available at https://github.com/SitongGong/CCFormer

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces ViTAR, a novel medical vision-language model framework that mimics human-like iterative reasoning for improving diagnostic accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between current medical VLMs' single-pass reasoning and the iterative, focused diagnostic processes of human clinicians.

Method: The approach involves creating ViTAR, which employs a cognitive chain of iterative reasoning, leverages a curated set of instruction data, and uses a two-stage training (supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning).

Result: ViTAR surpasses state-of-the-art models in medical diagnostic tasks and demonstrates better visual grounding in clinically critical regions during reasoning.

Conclusion: Incorporating expert-style iterative thinking into medical VLMs significantly enhances both the performance and trustworthiness of medical AI systems.

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) excel at image-text understanding but
typically rely on a single-pass reasoning that neglects localized visual cues.
In clinical practice, however, human experts iteratively scan, focus, and
refine the regions of interest before reaching a final diagnosis. To narrow
this machine-human perception gap, we introduce ViTAR, a novel VLM framework
that emulates the iterative reasoning process of human experts through a
cognitive chain of "think-act-rethink-answer". ViTAR treats medical images as
interactive objects, enabling models to engage multi-step visual reasoning. To
support this approach, we curate a high-quality instruction dataset comprising
1K interactive examples that encode expert-like diagnostic behaviors. In
addition, a 16K visual question answering training data has been curated
towards fine-grained visual diagnosis. We introduce a two-stage training
strategy that begins with supervised fine-tuning to guide cognitive
trajectories, followed by the reinforcement learning to optimize
decision-making. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that ViTAR outperforms
strong state-of-the-art models. Visual attention analysis reveals that from the
"think" to "rethink" rounds, ViTAR increasingly anchors visual grounding to
clinically critical regions and maintains high attention allocation to visual
tokens during reasoning, providing mechanistic insight into its improved
performance. These findings demonstrate that embedding expert-style iterative
thinking chains into VLMs enhances both performance and trustworthiness of
medical AI.

Motivation: Deepfake videos pose threats to information credibility, making it important to assess their visual realism to predict their influence and improve generation processes.

Method: The authors created the DREAM benchmark, which includes a diverse deepfake video dataset, 140,000 realism scores, textual descriptions from human annotators, and evaluations of 16 realism assessment methods.

Result: The study provides a comprehensive dataset, realism scores, and benchmarks for assessing deepfake realism and evaluates 16 methods including a new description-aligned CLIP approach.

Conclusion: DREAM serves as a foundational resource for future research in subjective deepfake realism assessment and its applications in Internet safety and deepfake generation improvements.

Abstract: Deep learning based face-swap videos, widely known as deepfakes, have drawn
wide attention due to their threat to information credibility. Recent works
mainly focus on the problem of deepfake detection that aims to reliably tell
deepfakes apart from real ones, in an objective way. On the other hand, the
subjective perception of deepfakes, especially its computational modeling and
imitation, is also a significant problem but lacks adequate study. In this
paper, we focus on the visual realism assessment of deepfakes, which is defined
as the automatic assessment of deepfake visual realism that approximates human
perception of deepfakes. It is important for evaluating the quality and
deceptiveness of deepfakes which can be used for predicting the influence of
deepfakes on Internet, and it also has potentials in improving the deepfake
generation process by serving as a critic. This paper prompts this new
direction by presenting a comprehensive benchmark called DREAM, which stands
for Deepfake REalism AssessMent. It is comprised of a deepfake video dataset of
diverse quality, a large scale annotation that includes 140,000 realism scores
and textual descriptions obtained from 3,500 human annotators, and a
comprehensive evaluation and analysis of 16 representative realism assessment
methods, including recent large vision language model based methods and a newly

TL;DR: This paper proposes a unified framework for improved semantic-aware feature learning and missing label recovery in multi-label image recognition with incomplete labels, yielding state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-label image recognition often encounters problems with incomplete labels, necessitating robust semantic-aware feature learning and efficient recovery of missing labels.

Method: The CLSL framework features a semantic-related feature learning module for robust feature extraction, a semantic-guided feature enhancement for aligning semantic and visual features, and a collaborative learning framework that dynamically enhances features and recovers labels.

Result: Experiments on three public datasets (MS-COCO, VOC2007, NUS-WIDE) show CLSL surpasses existing methods, demonstrating superior performance in multi-label recognition with incomplete labels.

Conclusion: The integration of semantic-aware feature learning and label recovery into a collaborative framework makes CLSL an effective solution for addressing challenges in multi-label image recognition with incomplete labels.

Abstract: Multi-label image recognition with incomplete labels is a critical learning
task and has emerged as a focal topic in computer vision. However, this task is
confronted with two core challenges: semantic-aware feature learning and
missing label recovery. In this paper, we propose a novel Collaborative
Learning of Semantic-aware feature learning and Label recovery (CLSL) method
for multi-label image recognition with incomplete labels, which unifies the two
aforementioned challenges into a unified learning framework. More specifically,
we design a semantic-related feature learning module to learn robust
semantic-related features by discovering semantic information and label
correlations. Then, a semantic-guided feature enhancement module is proposed to
generate high-quality discriminative semantic-aware features by effectively
aligning visual and semantic feature spaces. Finally, we introduce a
collaborative learning framework that integrates semantic-aware feature
learning and label recovery, which can not only dynamically enhance the
discriminability of semantic-aware features but also adaptively infer and
recover missing labels, forming a mutually reinforced loop between the two
processes. Extensive experiments on three widely used public datasets (MS-COCO,
VOC2007, and NUS-WIDE) demonstrate that CLSL outperforms the state-of-the-art
multi-label image recognition methods with incomplete labels.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Probabilistic Hyper-Graphs using Masked Autoencoders (PHG-MAE), merging neural graphs and masked autoencoders, to handle multi-modal visual tasks. It also provides a new dataset and tool for multi-modal learning integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to leverage self-supervised learning, specifically Masked Autoencoders, for multi-modal computer vision tasks without requiring manual data labeling while integrating classical and modern approaches.

Method: The authors propose PHG-MAE, which uses random modality masking to sample hyper-edge distributions, combines pre-training and fine-tuning into a single loop, enables inference-time ensembles for improved predictions, and allows knowledge distillation on smaller models with minimal performance loss.

Result: The PHG-MAE approach leads to improved performance and consistency in prediction tasks, especially for outdoor UAV scenarios, and provides a transferable methodology for other domains. Additionally, they developed a software tool and automated dataset extension for multi-modal learning.

Conclusion: PHG-MAE successfully integrates classical neural graphs with modern techniques like Masked Autoencoders, and facilitates scalable, automated, multi-modal, multi-task learning. The release of open-source tools and dataset extensions supports broader adoption.

Abstract: The computer vision domain has greatly benefited from an abundance of data
across many modalities to improve on various visual tasks. Recently, there has
been a lot of focus on self-supervised pre-training methods through Masked
Autoencoders (MAE) \cite{he2022masked,bachmann2022multimae}, usually used as a
first step before optimizing for a downstream task, such as classification or
regression. This is very useful as it doesn't require any manually labeled
data. In this work, we introduce Probabilistic Hyper-Graphs using Masked
Autoencoders (PHG-MAE): a novel model that unifies the classical work on neural
graphs \cite{leordeanu2021semi} with the modern approach of masked autoencoders
under a common theoretical framework. Through random masking of entire
modalities, not just patches, the model samples from the distribution of
hyper-edges on each forward pass. Additionally, the model adapts the standard
MAE algorithm by combining pre-training and fine-tuning into a single training
loop. Moreover, our approach enables the creation of inference-time ensembles
which, through aggregation, boost the final prediction performance and
consistency. Lastly, we show that we can apply knowledge distillation on top of
the ensembles with little loss in performance, even with models that have fewer
than 1M parameters. While our work mostly focuses on outdoor UAV scenes that
contain multiple world interpretations and modalities, the same steps can be
followed in other similar domains, such as autonomous driving or indoor
robotics. In order to streamline the process of integrating external
pre-trained experts for computer vision multi-modal multi-task learning (MTL)
scenarios, we developed a data-pipeline software. Using this tool, we have
created and released a fully-automated extension of the Dronescapes dataset.
All the technical details, code and reproduction steps are publicly released.

### [275] [Tracking the Spatiotemporal Evolution of Landslide Scars Using a Vision Foundation Model: A Novel and Universal Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10084)
*Meijun Zhou,Gang Mei,Zhengjing Ma,Nengxiong Xu,Jianbing Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for tracking landslide scars using a vision foundation model by transforming optical remote sensing images into continuous video sequences, allowing for effective spatiotemporal monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve understanding of landslide evolution mechanisms, failure precursors, and enhance early-warning systems, addressing the limitations of current single-phase or dual-phase landslide identification methods.

Method: The framework converts discrete optical remote sensing images into continuous video sequences and employs a vision foundation model designed for video segmentation. It incorporates knowledge-guided, auto-propagation, and interactive refinement approaches.

Result: The proposed method was validated on two case studies, Baige and Sela landslides, demonstrating its ability to monitor landslide evolution continuously and detect failure precursors and post-failure changes.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the framework provides a robust solution for tracking landslides, improving early warning capabilities, and assessing post-failure hazards and stability, offering significant advancements over traditional methods.

Abstract: Tracking the spatiotemporal evolution of large-scale landslide scars is
critical for understanding the evolution mechanisms and failure precursors,
enabling effective early-warning. However, most existing studies have focused
on single-phase or pre- and post-failure dual-phase landslide identification.
Although these approaches delineate post-failure landslide boundaries, it is
challenging to track the spatiotemporal evolution of landslide scars. To
address this problem, this study proposes a novel and universal framework for
tracking the spatiotemporal evolution of large-scale landslide scars using a
vision foundation model. The key idea behind the proposed framework is to
reconstruct discrete optical remote sensing images into a continuous video
sequence. This transformation enables a vision foundation model, which is
developed for video segmentation, to be used for tracking the evolution of
landslide scars. The proposed framework operates within a knowledge-guided,
auto-propagation, and interactive refinement paradigm to ensure the continuous
and accurate identification of landslide scars. The proposed framework was
validated through application to two representative cases: the post-failure
Baige landslide and the active Sela landslide (2017-2025). Results indicate
that the proposed framework enables continuous tracking of landslide scars,
capturing both failure precursors critical for early warning and post-failure
evolution essential for assessing secondary hazards and long-term stability.

### [276] [Gesplat: Robust Pose-Free 3D Reconstruction via Geometry-Guided Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10097)
*Jiahui Lu,Haihong Xiao,Xueyan Zhao,Wenxiong Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Gesplat is a framework that enhances 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis in scenarios with sparse-view and unreliable camera poses, leveraging a foundation model for pose estimation and introducing key technical innovations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing methods like NeRF and 3DGS, which require dense viewpoint coverage and accurate camera poses, restricting their use in sparse-view settings.

Method: Gesplat utilizes VGGT for pose estimation and dense point cloud generation, a hybrid Gaussian representation with position-shape optimization, a graph-guided refinement module, and flow-based depth regularization.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates robust performance in sparse-view settings, offering superior novel view synthesis and reconstruction consistency, validated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: Gesplat overcomes sparse-view limitations by introducing a robust framework, showcasing improvements over previous pose-free methods in handling complex datasets.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have advanced
3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis, but remain heavily dependent on
accurate camera poses and dense viewpoint coverage. These requirements limit
their applicability in sparse-view settings, where pose estimation becomes
unreliable and supervision is insufficient. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce Gesplat, a 3DGS-based framework that enables robust novel view
synthesis and geometrically consistent reconstruction from unposed sparse
images. Unlike prior works that rely on COLMAP for sparse point cloud
initialization, we leverage the VGGT foundation model to obtain more reliable
initial poses and dense point clouds. Our approach integrates several key
innovations: 1) a hybrid Gaussian representation with dual position-shape
optimization enhanced by inter-view matching consistency; 2) a graph-guided
attribute refinement module to enhance scene details; and 3) flow-based depth
regularization that improves depth estimation accuracy for more effective
supervision. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate
that our approach achieves more robust performance on both forward-facing and
large-scale complex datasets compared to other pose-free methods.

### [277] [Cooperative Pseudo Labeling for Unsupervised Federated Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10100)
*Kuangpu Guo,Lijun Sheng,Yongcan Yu,Jian Liang,Zilei Wang,Ran He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel method, FedCoPL, that uses pseudo-labeling and partial prompt aggregation to extend unsupervised federated learning (UFL) to classification tasks by leveraging CLIP vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of UFL in handling classification problems, leveraging the capabilities of vision-language models like CLIP for zero-shot predictions.

Method: FedCoPL involves clients estimating pseudo-label distributions and the server redistributing them to correct global imbalance. It also employs a partial prompt aggregation protocol by keeping personalized text prompts locally while aggregating visual prompts at the server.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that FedCoPL outperforms baseline methods in collaborative classification tasks under the UFL framework.

Conclusion: The proposed FedCoPL method successfully extends UFL to classification problems, providing robust performance through pseudo-labeling and prompt aggregation protocols.

Abstract: Unsupervised Federated Learning (UFL) aims to collaboratively train a global
model across distributed clients without sharing data or accessing label
information. Previous UFL works have predominantly focused on representation
learning and clustering tasks. Recently, vision language models (e.g., CLIP)
have gained significant attention for their powerful zero-shot prediction
capabilities. Leveraging this advancement, classification problems that were
previously infeasible under the UFL paradigm now present promising new
opportunities, yet remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we extend UFL to
the classification problem with CLIP for the first time and propose a novel
method, \underline{\textbf{Fed}}erated \underline{\textbf{Co}}operative
\underline{\textbf{P}}seudo \underline{\textbf{L}}abeling (\textbf{FedCoPL}).
Specifically, clients estimate and upload their pseudo label distribution, and
the server adjusts and redistributes them to avoid global imbalance among
classes. Moreover, we introduce a partial prompt aggregation protocol for
effective collaboration and personalization. In particular, visual prompts
containing general image features are aggregated at the server, while text
prompts encoding personalized knowledge are retained locally. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our FedCoPL compared to
baseline methods. Our code is available at

### [278] [Answer-Consistent Chain-of-thought Reinforcement Learning For Multi-modal Large Langauge Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10104)
*Minbin Huang,Runhui Huang,Chuanyang Zheng,Jingyao Li,Guoxuan Chen,Han Shi,Hong Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Answer-Consistent Reinforcement Learning (ACRE), an enhanced method for improving reasoning accuracy in multimodal LLMs, achieving superior consistency and performance compared to GRPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the problem of reasoning-answer inconsistency in reinforcement learning-optimized large language models, particularly in multimodal tasks where models often generate correct answers but fail to logically align them with the reasoning chains.

Method: The authors propose ACRE, an improved algorithm based on GRPO. ACRE incorporates an auxiliary consistency check where, after generating an answer and chain of thought, the model is tested by shuffling answer options and reevaluating the same reasoning trace. A consistency-verification reward is designed to encourage alignment between reasoning and answers while penalizing inconsistencies.

Result: ACRE demonstrated improved performance on multiple-choice visual question-answering tasks, achieving an average improvement of 2.2% in Video Reasoning and 1.5% in Math Reasoning benchmarks compared to the GRPO baseline.

Conclusion: ACRE successfully mitigates reasoning-answer mismatches by enforcing consistency between reasoning steps and final answers. It offers a promising approach to improving accuracy and robustness in multimodal reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated that
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can significantly enhance
reasoning abilities by directly optimizing correctness, rather than relying
solely on supervised imitation. This paradigm has been extended to multimodal
LLMs for complex video and image understanding tasks. However, while
outcome-driven RL improves answer accuracy, it can inadvertently decouple the
reasoning chain from the final answer, leading to situations where models
produce inconsistency between the reasoning trace and final answer. In our
experiments on multiple-choice visual question-answering tasks, the standard
GRPO method yields only 79.7\% consistency on MMVU between the reasoning steps
and the chosen answers, indicating frequent mismatches between answers and
reasoning. To this end, we propose Answer-Consistent Reinforcement Learning
(ACRE) that modifies the GRPO algorithm with an auxiliary consistency check.
After the model generates a chain of thought and an initial answer for a given
question, we shuffle the answer options and prompt the model again with the
same reasoning trace to predict a second answer. We design a
consistency-verification reward that grants a high reward only if both the
original and the post-shuffle answers agree and are correct; otherwise, a lower
reward is assigned accordingly. This mechanism penalizes reasoning-answer
misalignment and discourages the model from relying on spurious patterns, such
as option ordering biases. We evaluate ACRE on challenging Video Reasoning
benchmarks and multimodal math reasoning benchmarks, achieving an average 2.2\%
and 1.5\% improvement for Video Reasoning and Math Reasoning tasks over the
GRPO baseline.

*Aniruddha Srinivas Joshi,Godwyn James William,Shreyas Srinivas Joshi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes an uncertainty-aware framework to improve fire and smoke detection by refining detection confidence through statistical and visual cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing compact deep learning models for fire detection, like YOLOv5n and YOLOv8n, struggle with false positives and missed detections due to their reduced capacity.

Method: A post-detection framework with a Confidence Refinement Network is introduced, combining uncertainty estimates and visual cues such as color, edge, and texture features.

Result: The proposed framework improved precision, recall, and mean average precision on the D-Fire dataset with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: The method enhances the robustness and reliability of compact deep learning models for fire and smoke detection in real-world settings.

Abstract: Accurate fire and smoke detection is critical for safety and disaster
response, yet existing vision-based methods face challenges in balancing
efficiency and reliability. Compact deep learning models such as YOLOv5n and
YOLOv8n are widely adopted for deployment on UAVs, CCTV systems, and IoT
devices, but their reduced capacity often results in false positives and missed
detections. Conventional post-detection methods such as Non-Maximum Suppression
and Soft-NMS rely only on spatial overlap, which can suppress true positives or
retain false alarms in cluttered or ambiguous fire scenes. To address these
limitations, we propose an uncertainty aware post-detection framework that
rescales detection confidences using both statistical uncertainty and domain
relevant visual cues. A lightweight Confidence Refinement Network integrates
uncertainty estimates with color, edge, and texture features to adjust
detection scores without modifying the base model. Experiments on the D-Fire
dataset demonstrate improved precision, recall, and mean average precision
compared to existing baselines, with only modest computational overhead. These
results highlight the effectiveness of post-detection rescoring in enhancing
the robustness of compact deep learning models for real-world fire and smoke
detection.

*Rui Chen,Bin Liu,Changtao Miao,Xinghao Wang,Yi Li,Tao Gong,Qi Chu,Nenghai Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a training-free framework called In-Context Forensic Chain (ICFC) that utilizes multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) for interpretable image manipulation localization (IML) tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing security threats from advanced image tampering highlight the need for effective IML methods, especially ones that don’t rely on costly pixel-level annotations.

Method: ICFC employs objectified rule construction, adaptive filtering, and a multi-step reasoning pipeline that mimics expert workflows for systematic image forensic analysis.

Result: The ICFC framework surpasses state-of-the-art training-free methods and performs competitively or even better than weakly and fully supervised approaches across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: ICFC offers a highly interpretable, training-free IML method that combines image-level classification, pixel-level localization, and reasoning-based outputs, representing a significant advancement over existing solutions.

Abstract: Advances in image tampering pose serious security threats, underscoring the
need for effective image manipulation localization (IML). While supervised IML
achieves strong performance, it depends on costly pixel-level annotations.
Existing weakly supervised or training-free alternatives often underperform and
lack interpretability. We propose the In-Context Forensic Chain (ICFC), a
training-free framework that leverages multi-modal large language models
(MLLMs) for interpretable IML tasks. ICFC integrates an objectified rule
construction with adaptive filtering to build a reliable knowledge base and a
multi-step progressive reasoning pipeline that mirrors expert forensic
workflows from coarse proposals to fine-grained forensics results. This design
enables systematic exploitation of MLLM reasoning for image-level
classification, pixel-level localization, and text-level interpretability.
Across multiple benchmarks, ICFC not only surpasses state-of-the-art
training-free methods but also achieves competitive or superior performance
compared to weakly and fully supervised approaches.

*Yuxi Mi,Qiuyang Yuan,Zhizhou Zhong,Xuan Zhao,Jiaogen Zhou,Fubao Zhu,Jihong Guan,Shuigeng Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces ImmerIris, the largest dataset of off-axis ocular images for VR headset-based iris recognition, and proposes a normalization-free algorithm that outperforms traditional normalization-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Develop an iris recognition system adaptable to immersive technologies like VR/AR, addressing challenges like off-axis image acquisition, image degradation, and intra-class variation.

Method: ImmerIris was created as a large dataset of off-axis iris images. Evaluation protocols were designed for performance benchmarking, and a new normalization-free recognition method was proposed.

Result: Current methods adapted for on-axis iris recognition showed poorer performance on off-axis images. The proposed normalization-free approach consistently achieved higher accuracy.

Conclusion: The normalization-free paradigm offers a promising direction for iris recognition in immersive systems, successfully addressing challenges of off-axis acquisition and surpassing traditional methods.

Abstract: In egocentric applications such as augmented and virtual reality, immersive
iris recognition is emerging as an accurate and seamless way to identify
persons. While classic systems acquire iris images on-axis, i.e., via dedicated
frontal sensors in controlled settings, the immersive setup primarily captures
off-axis irises through tilt-placed headset cameras, with only mild control in
open scenes. This yields unique challenges, including perspective distortion,
intensified quality degradations, and intra-class variations in iris texture.
Datasets capturing these challenges remain scarce. To fill this gap, this paper
introduces ImmerIris, a large-scale dataset collected via VR headsets,
containing 499,791 ocular images from 564 subjects. It is, to the best of
current knowledge, the largest public dataset and among the first dedicated to
off-axis acquisition. Based on ImmerIris, evaluation protocols are constructed
to benchmark recognition methods under different challenging factors. Current
methods, primarily designed for classic on-axis imagery, perform
unsatisfactorily on the immersive setup, mainly due to reliance on fallible
normalization. To this end, this paper further proposes a normalization-free
paradigm that directly learns from ocular images with minimal adjustment.
Despite its simplicity, this approach consistently outperforms
normalization-based counterparts, pointing to a promising direction for robust
immersive recognition.

*Abu Saleh Musa Miah,Najmul Hassan,Md Maruf Al Hossain,Yuichi Okuyama,Jungpil Shin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a CNN-BiLSTM model with attention mechanisms to improve multi-class Parkinson's Disease severity classification from finger-tapping videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current gesture-based Parkinson's Disease recognition systems lack sufficient performance accuracy, necessitating an improved approach to accurately assess PD severity non-invasively.

Method: The authors introduced a deep learning model integrating Conv1D-MaxPooling blocks, BiLSTM layers, and attention mechanisms. The hybrid framework extracts motion-related features from finger-tapping videos and combines spatial and temporal data to classify PD severity into five classes.

Result: The proposed model effectively distinguished between five PD severity levels, demonstrating robust multi-class classification performance.

Conclusion: The attention-enhanced CNN-BiLSTM model offers a promising non-invasive system to assist clinicians in monitoring and tracking Parkinson's Disease progression, improving diagnostic accuracy.

Abstract: Effective clinical management and intervention development depend on accurate
evaluation of Parkinsons disease (PD) severity. Many researchers have worked on
developing gesture-based PD recognition systems; however, their performance
accuracy is not satisfactory. In this study, we propose a multi-class Parkinson
Disease detection system based on finger tapping using an attention-enhanced
CNN BiLSTM. We collected finger tapping videos and derived temporal, frequency,
and amplitude based features from wrist and hand movements. Then, we proposed a
hybrid deep learning framework integrating CNN, BiLSTM, and attention
mechanisms for multi-class PD severity classification from video-derived motion
features. First, the input sequence is reshaped and passed through a Conv1D
MaxPooling block to capture local spatial dependencies. The resulting feature
maps are fed into a BiLSTM layer to model temporal dynamics. An attention
mechanism focuses on the most informative temporal features, producing a
context vector that is further processed by a second BiLSTM layer. CNN-derived
features and attention-enhanced BiLSTM outputs are concatenated, followed by
dense and dropout layers, before the final softmax classifier outputs the
predicted PD severity level. The model demonstrated strong performance in
distinguishing between the five severity classes, suggesting that integrating
spatial temporal representations with attention mechanisms can improve
automated PD severity detection, making it a promising non-invasive tool to
support clinicians in PD monitoring and progression tracking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for improving low-light images and image resolution face challenges such as low performance in structural similarity (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), as well as high computational demands from excessive model parameters.

Method: The DeepFusionNet architecture was developed, providing a compact autoencoder-based approach for both image enhancement and super-resolution tasks. It focuses on producing high-quality results while significantly reducing the number of parameters.

Result: DeepFusionNet achieved an SSIM of 92.8% and a PSNR of 26.30 on the LOL-v1 dataset for enhancing low-light images, with only 2.5 million parameters. For super-resolution tasks, it reached a PSNR of 25.30 and SSIM of 80.7% using approximately 100 thousand parameters.

Conclusion: DeepFusionNet successfully balances computational efficiency and image quality, offering an effective solution for both image enhancement and super-resolution tasks in real-time image processing applications.

Abstract: Computer vision and image processing applications suffer from dark and
low-light images, particularly during real-time image transmission. Currently,
low light and dark images are converted to bright and colored forms using
autoencoders; however, these methods often achieve low SSIM and PSNR scores and
require high computational power due to their large number of parameters. To
address these challenges, the DeepFusionNet architecture has been developed.
According to the results obtained with the LOL-v1 dataset, DeepFusionNet
achieved an SSIM of 92.8% and a PSNR score of 26.30, while containing only
approximately 2.5 million parameters. On the other hand, conversion of blurry
and low-resolution images into high-resolution and blur-free images has gained
importance in image processing applications. Unlike GAN-based super-resolution
methods, an autoencoder-based super resolution model has been developed that
contains approximately 100 thousand parameters and uses the DeepFusionNet
architecture. According to the results of the tests, the DeepFusionNet based
super-resolution method achieved a PSNR of 25.30 and a SSIM score of 80.7
percent according to the validation set.

increasingly inadequate for modern production demands. Integrating UAV-based
aerial imagery with deep learning offers a promising solution to enhance
efficiency and reduce costs. This paper introduces YOLOv11-Litchi, a
lightweight and robust detection model specifically designed for UAV-based
litchi detection. Built upon the YOLOv11 framework, the proposed model
addresses key challenges such as small target size, large model parameters
hindering deployment, and frequent target occlusion. To tackle these issues,
three major innovations are incorporated: a multi-scale residual module to
improve contextual feature extraction across scales, a lightweight feature
fusion method to reduce model size and computational costs while maintaining
high accuracy, and a litchi occlusion detection head to mitigate occlusion
effects by emphasizing target regions and suppressing background interference.
Experimental results validate the model's effectiveness. YOLOv11-Litchi
achieves a parameter size of 6.35 MB - 32.5% smaller than the YOLOv11 baseline
- while improving mAP by 2.5% to 90.1% and F1-Score by 1.4% to 85.5%.
Additionally, the model achieves a frame rate of 57.2 FPS, meeting real-time

*Yecong Wan,Mingwen Shao,Renlong Wu,Wangmeng Zuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Color3D introduces a framework to colorize monochromatic 3D scenes using user-guided input, emphasizing chromatic richness, cross-view, and cross-time consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods often sacrifice color richness and controllability to enforce multi-view consistency in static scenarios.

Method: The approach leverages a single key view's colorization and personalizes a colorizer to propagate consistent chromatic values to other views and time steps.

Result: The method ensures visually vibrant, diverse, and consistent renderings across 3D scenes.

Conclusion: Color3D effectively simplifies 3D colorization to single image paradigms and achieves enhanced controllability and visual quality.

Abstract: In this work, we present Color3D, a highly adaptable framework for colorizing
both static and dynamic 3D scenes from monochromatic inputs, delivering
visually diverse and chromatically vibrant reconstructions with flexible
user-guided control. In contrast to existing methods that focus solely on
static scenarios and enforce multi-view consistency by averaging color
variations which inevitably sacrifice both chromatic richness and
controllability, our approach is able to preserve color diversity and
steerability while ensuring cross-view and cross-time consistency. In
particular, the core insight of our method is to colorize only a single key
view and then fine-tune a personalized colorizer to propagate its color to
novel views and time steps. Through personalization, the colorizer learns a
scene-specific deterministic color mapping underlying the reference view,
enabling it to consistently project corresponding colors to the content in
novel views and video frames via its inherent inductive bias. Once trained, the
personalized colorizer can be applied to infer consistent chrominance for all
other images, enabling direct reconstruction of colorful 3D scenes with a
dedicated Lab color space Gaussian splatting representation. The proposed
framework ingeniously recasts complicated 3D colorization as a more tractable
single image paradigm, allowing seamless integration of arbitrary image
colorization models with enhanced flexibility and controllability. Extensive
experiments across diverse static and dynamic 3D colorization benchmarks
substantiate that our method can deliver more consistent and chromatically rich
renderings with precise user control. Project Page

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to address the gap in ischemic stroke diagnosis, particularly the accurate localization of occluded blood vessels using medical imaging.

Method: The system combines nnUNet for lesion segmentation, an arterial atlas for vessel localization, and pGAN to generate synthetic MRA images from MRI scans.

Result: The model shows promising performance in localizing occluded vessels using T1 MRI scans of stroke patients.

Conclusion: The approach has the potential to improve and accelerate stroke diagnosis through better vessel localization.

Abstract: A key challenge in ischemic stroke diagnosis using medical imaging is the
accurate localization of the occluded vessel. Current machine learning methods
in focus primarily on lesion segmentation, with limited work on vessel
localization. In this study, we introduce Stroke Locus Net, an end-to-end deep
learning pipeline for detection, segmentation, and occluded vessel localization
using only MRI scans. The proposed system combines a segmentation branch using
nnUNet for lesion detection with an arterial atlas for vessel mapping and
identification, and a generation branch using pGAN to synthesize MRA images
from MRI. Our implementation demonstrates promising results in localizing
occluded vessels on stroke-affected T1 MRI scans, with potential for faster and

*Benjia Zhou,Bin Fu,Pei Cheng,Yanru Wang,Jiayuan Fan,Tao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ReMix, a unified framework for consistent visual character generation and editing, solving issues in fidelity and controllability seen in existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models excel in either generation or editing but fail to combine both effectively due to issues with identity consistency and spatial controllability.

Method: ReMix combines a ReMix Module for semantic editing without fine-tuning and an IP-ControlNet for pose and pixel-level consistency, leveraging a shared noise-space for alignment.

Result: ReMix demonstrates strong performance across tasks like personalized generation, image editing, and style transfer, validated by experiments showcasing its efficiency as a unified framework.

Conclusion: ReMix advances character-consistent image generation by addressing shortcomings in visual fidelity, offering a highly versatile solution across multiple tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., FLUX.1)
have greatly improved visual fidelity in consistent character generation and
editing. However, existing methods rarely unify these tasks within a single
framework. Generation-based approaches struggle with fine-grained identity
consistency across instances, while editing-based methods often lose spatial
controllability and instruction alignment. To bridge this gap, we propose
ReMix, a unified framework for character-consistent generation and editing. It
constitutes two core components: the ReMix Module and IP-ControlNet. The ReMix
Module leverages the multimodal reasoning ability of MLLMs to edit semantic
features of input images and adapt instruction embeddings to the native DiT
backbone without fine-tuning. While this ensures coherent semantic layouts,
pixel-level consistency and pose controllability remain challenging. To address
this, IP-ControlNet extends ControlNet to decouple semantic and layout cues
from reference images and introduces an {\epsilon}-equivariant latent space
that jointly denoises the reference and target images within a shared noise
space. Inspired by convergent evolution and quantum decoherence,i.e., where
environmental noise drives state convergence, this design promotes feature
alignment in the hidden space, enabling consistent object generation while
preserving identity. ReMix supports a wide range of tasks, including
personalized generation, image editing, style transfer, and multi-condition
synthesis. Extensive experiments validate its effectiveness and efficiency as a

*Zhenjie Mao,Yuhuan Yang,Chaofan Ma,Dongsheng Jiang,Jiangchao Yao,Ya Zhang,Yanfeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses limitations in Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) by proposing the SaFiRe framework, which mimics human cognitive processes for handling referential ambiguities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RIS models struggle with real-world challenges like referential ambiguities due to their reliance on simplified expressions.

Method: The proposed SaFiRe framework involves a two-phase process: forming global understanding and refining it through detailed inspection, using Mamba's scan-then-update mechanism.

Result: SaFiRe outperforms state-of-the-art RIS models in ambiguous referring expressions, validated through experiments on both standard and new benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The SaFiRe framework, combined with the newly introduced aRefCOCO benchmark, effectively addresses referential ambiguities in RIS models, advancing the field.

Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) aims to segment the target object in an
image given a natural language expression. While recent methods leverage
pre-trained vision backbones and more training corpus to achieve impressive
results, they predominantly focus on simple expressions--short, clear noun
phrases like "red car" or "left girl". This simplification often reduces RIS to
a key word/concept matching problem, limiting the model's ability to handle
referential ambiguity in expressions. In this work, we identify two challenging
real-world scenarios: object-distracting expressions, which involve multiple
entities with contextual cues, and category-implicit expressions, where the
object class is not explicitly stated. To address the challenges, we propose a
novel framework, SaFiRe, which mimics the human two-phase cognitive
process--first forming a global understanding, then refining it through
detail-oriented inspection. This is naturally supported by Mamba's
scan-then-update property, which aligns with our phased design and enables
efficient multi-cycle refinement with linear complexity. We further introduce
aRefCOCO, a new benchmark designed to evaluate RIS models under ambiguous
referring expressions. Extensive experiments on both standard and proposed
datasets demonstrate the superiority of SaFiRe over state-of-the-art baselines.

*César Borja,Carlos Plou,Rubén Martinez-Cantín,Ana C. Murillo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SparseUWSeg framework enhances underwater image segmentation using sparse annotations, achieving up to 5% improvement in mIoU metrics over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater ecological imagery analysis requires fine-grained semantic segmentation, which is limited by the challenges of obtaining dense annotations and relying on sparse point-labels.

Method: SparseUWSeg integrates active sampling for annotation guidance and a hybrid label propagation strategy combining SAM and superpixel-based methods.

Result: Experiments on two underwater datasets prove SparseUWSeg yields superior segmentation performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SparseUWSeg's innovative tool helps ecology researchers efficiently annotate and process underwater imagery using advanced algorithms and foundation models.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is essential to automate underwater imagery analysis
with ecology monitoring purposes. Unfortunately, fine grained underwater scene
analysis is still an open problem even for top performing segmentation models.
The high cost of obtaining dense, expert-annotated, segmentation labels hinders
the supervision of models in this domain. While sparse point-labels are easier
to obtain, they introduce challenges regarding which points to annotate and how
to propagate the sparse information. We present SparseUWSeg, a novel framework
that addresses both issues. SparseUWSeg employs an active sampling strategy to
guide annotators, maximizing the value of their point labels. Then, it
propagates these sparse labels with a hybrid approach leverages both the best
of SAM2 and superpixel-based methods. Experiments on two diverse underwater
datasets demonstrate the benefits of SparseUWSeg over state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving up to +5\% mIoU over D+NN. Our main contribution is the
design and release of a simple but effective interactive annotation tool,
integrating our algorithms. It enables ecology researchers to leverage
foundation models and computer vision to efficiently generate high-quality
segmentation masks to process their data.

*Cristiano Patrício,Luís F. Teixeira,João C. Neves*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViConEx-Med introduces a transformer-based framework for visual concept explainability, offering concept localization maps alongside predictive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of existing concept-based models that lack visual explanations, especially in high-stakes scenarios like medical applications.

Method: ViConEx-Med uses multi-concept learnable tokens and specialized attention layers for jointly predicting and localizing visual concepts.

Result: Experiments showed ViConEx-Med surpasses prior concept-based models and rivals black-box models in concept detection and localization precision.

Conclusion: ViConEx-Med opens a promising avenue for developing interpretable models grounded in visual concepts, particularly benefiting medical use cases.

Abstract: Concept-based models aim to explain model decisions with human-understandable
concepts. However, most existing approaches treat concepts as numerical
attributes, without providing complementary visual explanations that could
localize the predicted concepts. This limits their utility in real-world
applications and particularly in high-stakes scenarios, such as medical
use-cases. This paper proposes ViConEx-Med, a novel transformer-based framework
for visual concept explainability, which introduces multi-concept learnable
tokens to jointly predict and localize visual concepts. By leveraging
specialized attention layers for processing visual and text-based concept
tokens, our method produces concept-level localization maps while maintaining
high predictive accuracy. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world medical
datasets demonstrate that ViConEx-Med outperforms prior concept-based models
and achieves competitive performance with black-box models in terms of both
concept detection and localization precision. Our results suggest a promising
direction for building inherently interpretable models grounded in visual
concepts. Code is publicly available at

### [291] [HccePose(BF): Predicting Front \& Back Surfaces to Construct Ultra-Dense 2D-3D Correspondences for Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10177)
*Yulin Wang,Mengting Hu,Hongli Li,Chen Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study improves pose estimation by predicting 3D coordinates for both the front and back surfaces of objects and employing ultra-dense 2D-3D correspondences with a new encoding technique.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance pose estimation accuracy, which has traditionally been limited to using only the front surface of objects, by leveraging the entire surface and interior.

Method: A methodology that predicts 3D coordinates for both the front and back surfaces of objects, densely samples coordinates in-between, and introduces Hierarchical Continuous Coordinate Encoding (HCCE) for better representation.

Result: The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on seven core datasets from the BOP benchmark.

Conclusion: Utilizing full object surfaces and introducing HCCE significantly advances pose estimation, with the code openly available for further research.

Abstract: In pose estimation for seen objects, a prevalent pipeline involves using
neural networks to predict dense 3D coordinates of the object surface on 2D
images, which are then used to establish dense 2D-3D correspondences. However,
current methods primarily focus on more efficient encoding techniques to
improve the precision of predicted 3D coordinates on the object's front
surface, overlooking the potential benefits of incorporating the back surface
and interior of the object. To better utilize the full surface and interior of
the object, this study predicts 3D coordinates of both the object's front and
back surfaces and densely samples 3D coordinates between them. This process
creates ultra-dense 2D-3D correspondences, effectively enhancing pose
estimation accuracy based on the Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm.
Additionally, we propose Hierarchical Continuous Coordinate Encoding (HCCE) to
provide a more accurate and efficient representation of front and back surface
coordinates. Experimental results show that, compared to existing
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on the BOP website, the proposed approach
outperforms across seven classic BOP core datasets. Code is available at

### [292] [TCMA: Text-Conditioned Multi-granularity Alignment for Drone Cross-Modal Text-Video Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10180)
*Zixu Zhao,Yang Zhan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel dataset and framework for text-to-video and video-to-text retrieval in the UAV domain, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing advancements in text-video retrieval primarily focus on natural video domains, while the UAV domain lacks sufficient datasets with fine-grained captions.

Method: The researchers developed the Drone Video-Text Match Dataset (DVTMD) and proposed a Text-Conditioned Multi-granularity Alignment (TCMA) framework. TCMA integrates global video-sentence alignment, frame aggregation, and patch alignment while incorporating modules for filtration and adaptive attention.

Result: The TCMA achieves state-of-the-art performance with 45.5% R@1 for text-to-video and 42.8% R@1 for video-to-text retrieval, validated across the DVTMD and CapERA benchmarks.

Conclusion: The constructed dataset and proposed TCMA framework significantly advance text-video retrieval in the UAV domain, filling a key gap. The code and dataset will be made publicly available for further research.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become powerful platforms for real-time,
high-resolution data collection, producing massive volumes of aerial videos.
Efficient retrieval of relevant content from these videos is crucial for
applications in urban management, emergency response, security, and disaster
relief. While text-video retrieval has advanced in natural video domains, the
UAV domain remains underexplored due to limitations in existing datasets, such
as coarse and redundant captions. Thus, in this work, we construct the Drone
Video-Text Match Dataset (DVTMD), which contains 2,864 videos and 14,320
fine-grained, semantically diverse captions. The annotations capture multiple
complementary aspects, including human actions, objects, background settings,
environmental conditions, and visual style, thereby enhancing text-video
correspondence and reducing redundancy. Building on this dataset, we propose
the Text-Conditioned Multi-granularity Alignment (TCMA) framework, which
integrates global video-sentence alignment, sentence-guided frame aggregation,
and word-guided patch alignment. To further refine local alignment, we design a
Word and Patch Selection module that filters irrelevant content, as well as a
Text-Adaptive Dynamic Temperature Mechanism that adapts attention sharpness to
text type. Extensive experiments on DVTMD and CapERA establish the first
complete benchmark for drone text-video retrieval. Our TCMA achieves
state-of-the-art performance, including 45.5% R@1 in text-to-video and 42.8%
R@1 in video-to-text retrieval, demonstrating the effectiveness of our dataset
and method. The code and dataset will be released.

### [293] [Fairness Without Labels: Pseudo-Balancing for Bias Mitigation in Face Gender Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10191)
*Haohua Dong,Ana Manzano Rodríguez,Camille Guinaudeau,Shin'ichi Satoh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces pseudo-balancing, a strategy to mitigate demographic biases in face gender classification models using unlabeled, demographically balanced images without ground-truth annotations, achieving improved fairness and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face gender classification models tend to reflect demographic biases, resulting in uneven performance across different gender and racial subgroups, necessitating effective bias mitigation strategies.

Method: Pseudo-balancing applies demographic balance during pseudo-label selection with unlabeled race-balanced datasets and evaluates its effectiveness under real and simulated bias conditions.

Result: Pseudo-balancing improves fairness, enhances accuracy (79.81%, a 6.53% increase), and significantly narrows accuracy gaps between demographic groups, particularly reducing disparities within East Asian subgroups.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates the potential of using unlabeled demographically balanced datasets for bias mitigation in computer vision models without requiring ground-truth annotations.

Abstract: Face gender classification models often reflect and amplify demographic
biases present in their training data, leading to uneven performance across
gender and racial subgroups. We introduce pseudo-balancing, a simple and
effective strategy for mitigating such biases in semi-supervised learning. Our
method enforces demographic balance during pseudo-label selection, using only
unlabeled images from a race-balanced dataset without requiring access to
ground-truth annotations.
  We evaluate pseudo-balancing under two conditions: (1) fine-tuning a biased
gender classifier using unlabeled images from the FairFace dataset, and (2)
stress-testing the method with intentionally imbalanced training data to
simulate controlled bias scenarios. In both cases, models are evaluated on the
All-Age-Faces (AAF) benchmark, which contains a predominantly East Asian
population. Our results show that pseudo-balancing consistently improves
fairness while preserving or enhancing accuracy. The method achieves 79.81%
overall accuracy - a 6.53% improvement over the baseline - and reduces the
gender accuracy gap by 44.17%. In the East Asian subgroup, where baseline
disparities exceeded 49%, the gap is narrowed to just 5.01%. These findings
suggest that even in the absence of label supervision, access to a
demographically balanced or moderately skewed unlabeled dataset can serve as a
powerful resource for debiasing existing computer vision models.

*Feng Xiao,Hongbin Xu,Hai Ci,Wenxiong Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework to improve 3D object grounding using natural language descriptions with a focus on complex relational understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D object localization using natural language often requires interpreting complex spatial relationships, which current methods fail to handle globally involving multiple (n-ary) objects.

Method: The authors propose a framework incorporating n-ary relational learning and grouped supervision loss, along with hybrid attention mechanisms for more effective 3D-language alignment.

Result: The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks like ReferIt3D and ScanRefer.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the importance and effectiveness of considering n-ary relational perception in improving 3D object grounding tasks.

Abstract: Localizing 3D objects using natural language is essential for robotic scene
understanding. The descriptions often involve multiple spatial relationships to
distinguish similar objects, making 3D-language alignment difficult. Current
methods only model relationships for pairwise objects, ignoring the global
perceptual significance of n-ary combinations in multi-modal relational
understanding. To address this, we propose a novel progressive relational
learning framework for 3D object grounding. We extend relational learning from
binary to n-ary to identify visual relations that match the referential
description globally. Given the absence of specific annotations for referred
objects in the training data, we design a grouped supervision loss to
facilitate n-ary relational learning. In the scene graph created with n-ary
relationships, we use a multi-modal network with hybrid attention mechanisms to
further localize the target within the n-ary combinations. Experiments and
ablation studies on the ReferIt3D and ScanRefer benchmarks demonstrate that our
method outperforms the state-of-the-art, and proves the advantages of the n-ary
relational perception in 3D localization.

TL;DR: The paper develops a diagnostic system for cervical pathology using advanced deep learning pretrained on large datasets to address limitations in current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in cervical cancer diagnostics, specifically improving accuracy, generalizability, and subspecialty-specific pathology analysis.

Method: Two-stage pretraining: self-supervised learning on tissue patches for feature extraction, followed by enhancement using multimodal image-text pairs. It integrates this foundation for eight diagnostic functions.

Result: CerS-Path demonstrated 99.38% screening sensitivity, high performance across diagnostic tasks, and excellent generalizability in a multicenter trial involving 3,173 cases.

Conclusion: CerS-Path offers significant advancements in cervical pathology diagnostics, showcasing potential for clinical translation and improving subspecialty-specific tools.

Abstract: Cervical cancer remains a major malignancy, necessitating extensive and
complex histopathological assessments and comprehensive support tools. Although
deep learning shows promise, these models still lack accuracy and
generalizability. General foundation models offer a broader reach but remain
limited in capturing subspecialty-specific features and task adaptability. We
introduce the Cervical Subspecialty Pathology (CerS-Path) diagnostic system,
developed through two synergistic pretraining stages: self-supervised learning
on approximately 190 million tissue patches from 140,000 slides to build a
cervical-specific feature extractor, and multimodal enhancement with 2.5
million image-text pairs, followed by integration with multiple downstream
diagnostic functions. Supporting eight diagnostic functions, including rare
cancer classification and multimodal Q&A, CerS-Path surpasses prior foundation
models in scope and clinical applicability. Comprehensive evaluations
demonstrate a significant advance in cervical pathology, with prospective
testing on 3,173 cases across five centers maintaining 99.38% screening
sensitivity and excellent generalizability, highlighting its potential for
subspecialty diagnostic translation and cervical cancer screening.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework and metric (Style Embedding Distribution Discrepancy, SEDD) to quantify the synthetic-to-real gap in autonomous driving datasets, aiming to enhance their utility for AI-based models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure the reliability of autonomous driving systems, extensive real-world testing is essential but impractical. Synthetic datasets are promising alternatives, yet the domain gap between synthetic and real-world data limits AI model generalization.

Method: The paper proposes a framework combining Gram matrix-based style extraction with metric learning to create style embeddings, and introduces SEDD as a metric for quantifying the synthetic-to-real gap. Experiments with benchmarks and comparison datasets validate the approach.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework and SEDD metric effectively quantify the synthetic-to-real gap, with benchmarks established using publicly available datasets and sim-to-real methods.

Conclusion: The work offers a standardized tool for assessing and improving synthetic datasets, paving the way for better data-driven autonomous driving models by addressing the domain gap issue.

Abstract: Ensuring the reliability of autonomous driving perception systems requires
extensive environment-based testing, yet real-world execution is often
impractical. Synthetic datasets have therefore emerged as a promising
alternative, offering advantages such as cost-effectiveness, bias free
labeling, and controllable scenarios. However, the domain gap between synthetic
and real-world datasets remains a critical bottleneck for the generalization of
AI-based autonomous driving models. Quantifying this synthetic-to-real gap is
thus essential for evaluating dataset utility and guiding the design of more
effective training pipelines. In this paper, we establish a systematic
framework for quantifying the synthetic-to-real gap in autonomous driving
systems, and propose Style Embedding Distribution Discrepancy (SEDD) as a novel
evaluation metric. Our framework combines Gram matrix-based style extraction
with metric learning optimized for intra-class compactness and inter-class
separation to extract style embeddings. Furthermore, we establish a benchmark
using publicly available datasets. Experiments are conducted on a variety of
datasets and sim-to-real methods, and the results show that our method is
capable of quantifying the synthetic-to-real gap. This work provides a
standardized quality control tool that enables systematic diagnosis and
targeted enhancement of synthetic datasets, advancing future development of
data-driven autonomous driving systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces "AnomReason," a benchmark for detecting semantic anomalies (e.g., commonsense violations) in AI-generated images, and a multi-agent pipeline "AnomAgent" to create structured annotations for anomaly detection. The proposed method improves upon existing benchmarks and has practical applications in explainable deepfake detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research is to address subtle semantic anomalies in AI-generated content (AIGC) that affect their plausibility and trustworthiness. These anomalies include violations of commonsense and physical laws, which necessitate effective detection for applications such as deepfake detection, AIGC image analysis, and semantic authenticity.

Method: The authors introduce "semantic anomaly detection and reasoning" with a large-scale benchmark, AnomReason. They also propose AnomAgent, a modular multi-agent pipeline with human-in-the-loop verification to generate structured annotations as quadruples (Name, Phenomenon, Reasoning, Severity). By fine-tuning models on these annotations, they achieve improved metrics for semantic matching.

Result: Fine-tuned models on the AnomReason dataset outperform existing vision-language baselines on proposed metrics, SemAP and SemF1. Additionally, the approach demonstrates practical utility in explainable deepfake detection and semantic assessments of image generators.

Conclusion: AnomReason and AnomAgent establish a strong foundation for semantic anomaly detection in AIGC, enabling better assessment and improvement of semantic plausibility in AI-generated images. Releasing these resources will promote reproducible research in semantic authenticity and AI forensics.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of
  AI-generated content (AIGC) has enabled the synthesis of visually convincing
images; however, many such outputs exhibit subtle \textbf{semantic anomalies},
including unrealistic object configurations, violations of physical laws, or
commonsense inconsistencies, which compromise the overall plausibility of the
generated scenes. Detecting these semantic-level anomalies
  is essential for assessing the trustworthiness of AIGC media, especially in
AIGC image analysis, explainable deepfake detection and semantic authenticity
assessment. In this paper,
  we formalize \textbf{semantic anomaly detection and reasoning} for AIGC
images and
  introduce \textbf{AnomReason}, a large-scale benchmark with structured
annotations as quadruples \emph{(Name, Phenomenon, Reasoning, Severity)}.
Annotations are produced by
  a modular multi-agent pipeline (\textbf{AnomAgent}) with lightweight
human-in-the-loop verification, enabling scale while preserving quality.
  At construction time, AnomAgent processed approximately 4.17\,B GPT-4o
tokens, providing scale evidence for the resulting structured annotations. We
further
  show that models fine-tuned on AnomReason achieve consistent gains over
strong vision-language baselines under our proposed semantic matching metric
(\textit{SemAP} and \textit{SemF1}).
  Applications to {explainable deepfake detection} and {semantic reasonableness
assessment of image generators} demonstrate practical utility. In summary,
AnomReason and AnomAgent
  serve as a foundation for measuring and improving the semantic plausibility
of AI-generated images. We will release code, metrics, data, and task-aligned
models to support reproducible research on semantic authenticity and
interpretable AIGC forensics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of large vision models (LVMs) for zero-shot medical imaging tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results in specific areas without domain-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to leverage advancements in generative video modeling to address medical imaging tasks, motivated by the strong zero-shot capabilities of scaled autoregressive models.

Method: The study evaluates a large vision model (LVM) across tasks like organ segmentation, denoising, super-resolution, and motion prediction, without fine-tuning it on medical datasets.

Result: The LVM demonstrates strong performances in medical imaging tasks, notably achieving state-of-the-art spatial accuracy for radiotherapy motion prediction.

Conclusion: Zero-shot capabilities of general-purpose video models have implications for creating unified medical foundation models in the future, demonstrating promise in medical imagery applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in large generative models have shown that simple
autoregressive formulations, when scaled appropriately, can exhibit strong
zero-shot generalization across domains. Motivated by this trend, we
investigate whether autoregressive video modeling principles can be directly
applied to medical imaging tasks, despite the model never being trained on
medical data. Specifically, we evaluate a large vision model (LVM) in a
zero-shot setting across four representative tasks: organ segmentation,
denoising, super-resolution, and motion prediction. Remarkably, even without
domain-specific fine-tuning, the LVM can delineate anatomical structures in CT
scans and achieve competitive performance on segmentation, denoising, and
super-resolution. Most notably, in radiotherapy motion prediction, the model
forecasts future 3D CT phases directly from prior phases of a 4D CT scan,
producing anatomically consistent predictions that capture patient-specific
respiratory dynamics with realistic temporal coherence. We evaluate the LVM on
4D CT data from 122 patients, totaling over 1,820 3D CT volumes. Despite no
prior exposure to medical data, the model achieves strong performance across
all tasks and surpasses specialized DVF-based and generative baselines in
motion prediction, achieving state-of-the-art spatial accuracy. These findings
reveal the emergence of zero-shot capabilities in medical video modeling and
highlight the potential of general-purpose video models to serve as unified
learners and reasoners laying the groundwork for future medical foundation
models built on video models.

*Abdelrhman Elrawy,Emad A. Mohammed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper optimizes 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for efficiency, achieving significant compactness with minimal trade-offs in reconstruction quality for few-shot view synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS faces limitations in few-shot scenarios due to overfitting and bloated reconstructions, while existing solutions improve quality but increase primitive count excessively.

Method: The method introduces a novel densification trigger using opacity gradient for error estimation, coupled with a conservative pruning schedule to prevent destructive optimization. It also incorporates depth-correlation loss for geometric guidance.

Result: The proposed framework achieves over 40% compactness on the LLFF dataset and approximately 70% on Mip-NeRF 360, with only modest reconstruction trade-offs.

Conclusion: The approach improves the Pareto frontier for quality-versus-efficiency in few-shot view synthesis, presenting a more compact and efficient optimization method for 3DGS.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) struggles in few-shot scenarios, where its
standard adaptive density control (ADC) can lead to overfitting and bloated
reconstructions. While state-of-the-art methods like FSGS improve quality, they
often do so by significantly increasing the primitive count. This paper
presents a framework that revises the core 3DGS optimization to prioritize
efficiency. We replace the standard positional gradient heuristic with a novel
densification trigger that uses the opacity gradient as a lightweight proxy for
rendering error. We find this aggressive densification is only effective when
paired with a more conservative pruning schedule, which prevents destructive
optimization cycles. Combined with a standard depth-correlation loss for
geometric guidance, our framework demonstrates a fundamental improvement in
efficiency. On the 3-view LLFF dataset, our model is over 40% more compact (32k
vs. 57k primitives) than FSGS, and on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset, it achieves a
reduction of approximately 70%. This dramatic gain in compactness is achieved
with a modest trade-off in reconstruction metrics, establishing a new
state-of-the-art on the quality-vs-efficiency Pareto frontier for few-shot view
synthesis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VividAnimator is a method for creating realistic human animations from audio and sparse hand pose data, addressing common issues of stiff head movement and blurry hands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current audio- and pose-driven human animation methods face problems like unnatural head movements and unclear hand representations caused by weak correlations and structural complexity.

Method: The authors introduce a three-part framework: a pre-trained Hand Clarity Codebook (HCC) for better hand textures, a Dual-Stream Audio-Aware Module (DSAA) for separate modeling of lips and head poses, and a Pose Calibration Trick (PCT) for smoother gestures.

Result: Their method, VividAnimator, achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly improving hand clarity, gesture realism, and overall animation detail.

Conclusion: VividAnimator successfully resolves key issues in human animation, offering a high-quality solution validated through quantitative and qualitative evaluation.

Abstract: Existing for audio- and pose-driven human animation methods often struggle
with stiff head movements and blurry hands, primarily due to the weak
correlation between audio and head movements and the structural complexity of
hands. To address these issues, we propose VividAnimator, an end-to-end
framework for generating high-quality, half-body human animations driven by
audio and sparse hand pose conditions. Our framework introduces three key
innovations. First, to overcome the instability and high cost of online
codebook training, we pre-train a Hand Clarity Codebook (HCC) that encodes
rich, high-fidelity hand texture priors, significantly mitigating hand
degradation. Second, we design a Dual-Stream Audio-Aware Module (DSAA) to model
lip synchronization and natural head pose dynamics separately while enabling
interaction. Third, we introduce a Pose Calibration Trick (PCT) that refines
and aligns pose conditions by relaxing rigid constraints, ensuring smooth and
natural gesture transitions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Vivid
Animator achieves state-of-the-art performance, producing videos with superior
hand detail, gesture realism, and identity consistency, validated by both

*Markus Käppeler,Özgün Çiçek,Daniele Cattaneo,Claudius Gläser,Yakov Miron,Abhinav Valada*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DualViewDistill, a hybrid framework for 3D object detection in autonomous driving, leveraging both bird's-eye-view (BEV) and perspective-view (PV) features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of using only PV or BEV features, which cannot fully exploit object details and spatial scene structures in autonomous driving.

Method: DualViewDistill combines PV features with semantically enriched BEV maps derived using a distillation process from foundation model features (DINOv2) and aggregates these via deformable processing.

Result: The framework achieved state-of-the-art performance in 3D object detection and tracking on the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 benchmarks.

Conclusion: The experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, highlighting the potential of foundation model-based BEV maps for enhancing perception in autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Camera-based 3D object detection and tracking are essential for perception in
autonomous driving. Current state-of-the-art approaches often rely exclusively
on either perspective-view (PV) or bird's-eye-view (BEV) features, limiting
their ability to leverage both fine-grained object details and spatially
structured scene representations. In this work, we propose DualViewDistill, a
hybrid detection and tracking framework that incorporates both PV and BEV
camera image features to leverage their complementary strengths. Our approach
introduces BEV maps guided by foundation models, leveraging descriptive DINOv2
features that are distilled into BEV representations through a novel
distillation process. By integrating PV features with BEV maps enriched with
semantic and geometric features from DINOv2, our model leverages this hybrid
representation via deformable aggregation to enhance 3D object detection and
tracking. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 benchmarks
demonstrate that DualViewDistill achieves state-of-the-art performance. The
results showcase the potential of foundation model BEV maps to enable more
reliable perception for autonomous driving. We make the code and pre-trained
models available at https://dualviewdistill.cs.uni-freiburg.de .

*Sayan Mandal,Divyadarshini Karthikeyan,Manas Paldhe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAM2LoRA is an efficient fine-tuning strategy for the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) aimed at fundus image segmentation. It reduces training parameters significantly while achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning SAM2 for fundus image segmentation is resource-intensive, particularly in low-resource settings.

Method: The method involves integrating low-rank adapters into the image encoder and mask decoder of SAM2, combined with a composite loss function (segmentationBCE, SoftDice, and FocalTversky).

Result: SAM2LoRA achieves Dice scores of up to 0.86 and 0.93 for blood vessel and optic disc segmentation, respectively, and AUC values up to 0.98 and 0.99 across 11 datasets.

Conclusion: SAM2LoRA offers a highly effective and resource-efficient solution for fundus image segmentation, substantially reducing training overhead while maintaining superior performance.

Abstract: We propose SAM2LoRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy that adapts
the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) for fundus image segmentation. SAM2 employs
a masked autoencoder-pretrained Hierarchical Vision Transformer for multi-scale
feature decoding, enabling rapid inference in low-resource settings; however,
fine-tuning remains challenging. To address this, SAM2LoRA integrates a
low-rank adapter into both the image encoder and mask decoder, requiring fewer
than 5\% of the original trainable parameters. Our analysis indicates that for
cross-dataset fundus segmentation tasks, a composite loss function combining
segmentationBCE, SoftDice, and FocalTversky losses is essential for optimal
network tuning. Evaluated on 11 challenging fundus segmentation datasets,
SAM2LoRA demonstrates high performance in both blood vessel and optic disc
segmentation under cross-dataset training conditions. It achieves Dice scores
of up to 0.86 and 0.93 for blood vessel and optic disc segmentation,
respectively, and AUC values of up to 0.98 and 0.99, achieving state-of-the-art
performance while substantially reducing training overhead.

*Joy Hsu,Emily Jin,Jiajun Wu,Niloy J. Mitra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FactoredScenes proposes a framework for synthesizing realistic 3D scenes by leveraging room structures and learning object pose variations, achieving visually indistinguishable results from real-world ScanNet scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world scene capture is challenging and limited in data availability, creating the need for methods to generate realistic scenes with varied object poses.

Method: The framework uses a factored representation of room programs and object poses, learns reusable layout patterns, employs large language models for program generation, and utilizes a program-conditioned model for object placement.

Result: FactoredScenes successfully generates realistic 3D room scenes that are hard to distinguish from authentic ScanNet scenes.

Conclusion: The approach highlights the potential of structured decomposition combined with program generation and advanced placement models to create highly realistic synthetic scenes.

Abstract: Real-world scenes, such as those in ScanNet, are difficult to capture, with
highly limited data available. Generating realistic scenes with varied object
poses remains an open and challenging task. In this work, we propose
FactoredScenes, a framework that synthesizes realistic 3D scenes by leveraging
the underlying structure of rooms while learning the variation of object poses
from lived-in scenes. We introduce a factored representation that decomposes
scenes into hierarchically organized concepts of room programs and object
poses. To encode structure, FactoredScenes learns a library of functions
capturing reusable layout patterns from which scenes are drawn, then uses large
language models to generate high-level programs, regularized by the learned
library. To represent scene variations, FactoredScenes learns a
program-conditioned model to hierarchically predict object poses, and retrieves
and places 3D objects in a scene. We show that FactoredScenes generates
realistic, real-world rooms that are difficult to distinguish from real ScanNet
scenes.

Abstract: Accurate traffic congestion classification is essential for intelligent
transportation systems and real-time urban traffic management. This paper
presents a multimodal framework combining open-vocabulary visual-language
reasoning (CLIP), object detection (YOLO-World), and motion analysis via
MOG2-based background subtraction. The system predicts congestion levels on an
ordinal scale from 1 (free flow) to 5 (severe congestion), enabling
semantically aligned and temporally consistent classification. To enhance
interpretability, we incorporate motion-based confidence weighting and generate
annotated visual outputs. Experimental results show the model achieves 76.7
percent accuracy, an F1 score of 0.752, and a Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) of
0.684, significantly outperforming unimodal baselines. These results
demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in preserving ordinal structure and

*Rugved Katole,Christopher Stewart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ortho-Fuse uses optical flow to enhance orthomosaic reconstruction in crop mapping, reducing overlap requirements by 20%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Farmers face technical limitations in using AI-driven systems due to sparse aerial image datasets that hinder effective crop mapping.

Method: Ortho-Fuse employs intermediate optical flow estimation to synthesize transitional imagery, augmenting feature correspondences between aerial frames.

Result: Experimental validation showed that Ortho-Fuse lowers overlap requirements from 70-80% to approximately 50-60% for reliable orthomosaic generation.

Conclusion: Ortho-Fuse addresses a critical barrier to AI adoption in precision agriculture, offering improved integration for resource-constrained crop monitoring systems.

Abstract: AI-driven crop health mapping systems offer substantial advantages over
conventional monitoring approaches through accelerated data acquisition and
cost reduction. However, widespread farmer adoption remains constrained by
technical limitations in orthomosaic generation from sparse aerial imagery
datasets. Traditional photogrammetric reconstruction requires 70-80\%
inter-image overlap to establish sufficient feature correspondences for
accurate geometric registration. AI-driven systems operating under
resource-constrained conditions cannot consistently achieve these overlap
thresholds, resulting in degraded reconstruction quality that undermines user
confidence in autonomous monitoring technologies. In this paper, we present
Ortho-Fuse, an optical flow-based framework that enables the generation of a
reliable orthomosaic with reduced overlap requirements. Our approach employs
intermediate flow estimation to synthesize transitional imagery between
consecutive aerial frames, artificially augmenting feature correspondences for
improved geometric reconstruction. Experimental validation demonstrates a 20\%
reduction in minimum overlap requirements. We further analyze adoption barriers
in precision agriculture to identify pathways for enhanced integration of
AI-driven monitoring systems.

### [307] [PointMAC: Meta-Learned Adaptation for Robust Test-Time Point Cloud Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10365)
*Linlian Jiang,Rui Ma,Li Gu,Ziqiang Wang,Xinxin Zuo,Yang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PointMAC introduces a meta-learned framework for test-time adaptive point cloud completion, achieving state-of-the-art results through self-supervised auxiliary objectives and novel calibration strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for point cloud completion struggle to adapt to new structural patterns and distortions during inference due to reliance on static models and training-time biases.

Method: PointMAC employs Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) to align auxiliary objectives with the primary task and applies an adaptive self-supervised refinement process during inference.

Result: Extensive experiments on diverse datasets validate that PointMAC produces superior point cloud completions compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: PointMAC sets a new benchmark for robust point cloud completion by enabling sample-specific test-time adaptations and introducing innovative meta-learning-driven stabilization mechanisms.

Abstract: Point cloud completion is essential for robust 3D perception in
safety-critical applications such as robotics and augmented reality. However,
existing models perform static inference and rely heavily on inductive biases
learned during training, limiting their ability to adapt to novel structural
patterns and sensor-induced distortions at test time. To address this
limitation, we propose PointMAC, a meta-learned framework for robust test-time
adaptation in point cloud completion. It enables sample-specific refinement
without requiring additional supervision. Our method optimizes the completion
model under two self-supervised auxiliary objectives that simulate structural
and sensor-level incompleteness. A meta-auxiliary learning strategy based on
Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) ensures that adaptation driven by auxiliary
objectives is consistently aligned with the primary completion task. During
inference, we adapt the shared encoder on-the-fly by optimizing auxiliary
losses, with the decoder kept fixed. To further stabilize adaptation, we
introduce Adaptive $\lambda$-Calibration, a meta-learned mechanism for
balancing gradients between primary and auxiliary objectives. Extensive
experiments on synthetic, simulated, and real-world datasets demonstrate that
PointMAC achieves state-of-the-art results by refining each sample individually
to produce high-quality completions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first work to apply meta-auxiliary test-time adaptation to point cloud
completion.

*Saurabh Kataria,Ayca Ermis,Lovely Yeswanth Panchumarthi,Minxiao Wang,Xiao Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study explores using Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) for photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor data analysis by converting 1D time-series into 2D image-like representations. VFMs achieve state-of-the-art performance on tasks like blood pressure estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks innovative approaches to process PPG signals and improve performance in physiological tasks using foundation models while maintaining computational efficiency.

Method: PPG signals are transformed into 2D image-like representations like Short-Time Fourier transform (STFT), and VFMs such as DINOv3 and SIGLIP-2 are fine-tuned using PEFT techniques.

Result: Vision4PPG outperforms prior models, achieving state-of-the-art results in PPG-based tasks like blood pressure estimation and other vital sign measurements, demonstrating generalization across multiple formats.

Conclusion: Vision4PPG introduces VFMs as a computationally efficient and accurate tool for PPG signal processing, offering clinician-scientists new capabilities for physiological insights.

Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor in wearable and clinical devices provides
valuable physiological insights in a non-invasive and real-time fashion.
Specialized Foundation Models (FM) or repurposed time-series FMs are used to
benchmark physiological tasks. Our experiments with fine-tuning FMs reveal that
Vision FM (VFM) can also be utilized for this purpose and, in fact,
surprisingly leads to state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on many tasks,
notably blood pressure estimation. We leverage VFMs by simply transforming
one-dimensional PPG signals into image-like two-dimensional representations,
such as the Short-Time Fourier transform (STFT). Using the latest VFMs, such as
DINOv3 and SIGLIP-2, we achieve promising performance on other vital signs and
blood lab measurement tasks as well. Our proposal, Vision4PPG, unlocks a new
class of FMs to achieve SOTA performance with notable generalization to other
2D input representations, including STFT phase and recurrence plots. Our work
improves upon prior investigations of vision models for PPG by conducting a
comprehensive study, comparing them to state-of-the-art time-series FMs, and
demonstrating the general PPG processing ability by reporting results on six
additional tasks. Thus, we provide clinician-scientists with a new set of
powerful tools that is also computationally efficient, thanks to
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Crack-Segmenter, a self-supervised framework to detect pavement cracks without manual annotations, outperforming existing supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual pixel-level annotation for crack detection is costly and time-consuming, hindering scalability for large-scale infrastructure monitoring.

Method: The Crack-Segmenter framework integrates three modules: Scale-Adaptive Embedder (multi-scale feature extraction), Directional Attention Transformer (linear crack continuity), and Attention-Guided Fusion (adaptive feature integration).

Result: Crack-Segmenter outperformed 13 state-of-the-art supervised methods on ten public datasets across metrics like mIoU, Dice score, XOR, and Hausdorff Distance.

Conclusion: Self-supervised crack detection is feasible and yields superior results, enabling cost-effective and scalable infrastructure monitoring, while driving advancements in self-supervised learning research.

Abstract: Pavement crack detection has long depended on costly and time-intensive
pixel-level annotations, which limit its scalability for large-scale
infrastructure monitoring. To overcome this barrier, this paper examines the
feasibility of achieving effective pixel-level crack segmentation entirely
without manual annotations. Building on this objective, a fully self-supervised
framework, Crack-Segmenter, is developed, integrating three complementary
modules: the Scale-Adaptive Embedder (SAE) for robust multi-scale feature
extraction, the Directional Attention Transformer (DAT) for maintaining linear
crack continuity, and the Attention-Guided Fusion (AGF) module for adaptive
feature integration. Through evaluations on ten public datasets,
Crack-Segmenter consistently outperforms 13 state-of-the-art supervised methods
across all major metrics, including mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), Dice
score, XOR, and Hausdorff Distance (HD). These findings demonstrate that
annotation-free crack detection is not only feasible but also superior,
enabling transportation agencies and infrastructure managers to conduct
scalable and cost-effective monitoring. This work advances self-supervised
learning and motivates pavement cracks detection research.

### [310] [Identifying bias in CNN image classification using image scrambling and transforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10383)
*Sai Teja Erukude*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores how CNNs, which are widely used in machine vision, deal with hidden biases and distinguishes contextual information from background noise using two proposed methods tested on six datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the 'black box' nature of CNNs, where it is unclear which features contribute most to classification and how biases, especially from background information, might affect decision-making.

Method: The paper proposes two techniques: (1) dividing images into smaller, randomly shuffled non-overlapping tiles, and (2) applying image transforms like Fourier, Wavelet, and Median filter. These were tested on six datasets to evaluate how CNNs process background information.

Result: The proposed methods effectively identified and distinguished between contextual information and background noise, and could alert users to the influence of background noise on CNN decision-making.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of detecting and understanding biases in CNNs, offering practical methods that work even in scenarios where background information is not readily available.

Abstract: CNNs are now prevalent as the primary choice for most machine vision problems
due to their superior rate of classification and the availability of
user-friendly libraries. These networks effortlessly identify and select
features in a non-intuitive data-driven manner, making it difficult to
determine which features were most influential. That leads to a ``black box",
where users cannot know how the image data are analyzed but rely on empirical
results. Therefore the decision-making process can be biased by background
information that is difficult to detect. Here we discuss examples of such
hidden biases and propose techniques for identifying them, methods to
distinguish between contextual information and background noise, and explore
whether CNNs learn from irrelevant features. One effective approach to identify
dataset bias is to classify blank background parts of the images. However, in
some situations a blank background in the images is not available, making it
more difficult to separate the foreground information from the blank
background. Such parts of the image can also be considered contextual learning,
not necessarily bias. To overcome this, we propose two approaches that were
tested on six different datasets, including natural, synthetic, and hybrid
datasets. The first method involves dividing images into smaller,
non-overlapping tiles of various sizes, which are then shuffled randomly,
making classification more challenging. The second method involves the
application of several image transforms, including Fourier, Wavelet transforms,
and Median filter, and their combinations. These transforms help recover
background noise information used by CNN to classify images. Results indicate
that this method can effectively distinguish between contextual information and
background noise, and alert on the presence of background noise even without
the need to use background information.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AVoCaDO introduces a novel two-stage framework for improving audiovisual video captioning with enhanced temporal and semantic alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Audio-visual events in videos are often temporally aligned but existing captioning models lack efficient methods to capture and describe such richness and coherence.

Method: AVoCaDO employs a two-stage post-training process: fine-tuning with a curated dataset and optimizing coherence using specialized reward functions.

Result: AVoCaDO outperforms current models on multiple audiovisual video captioning benchmarks and exhibits competitive results even on visual-only tasks.

Conclusion: This method advances the state-of-the-art by effectively coupling audio-visual modality with temporal dynamics for enriched video captioning.

Abstract: Audiovisual video captioning aims to generate semantically rich descriptions
with temporal alignment between visual and auditory events, thereby benefiting
both video understanding and generation. In this paper, we present AVoCaDO, a
powerful audiovisual video captioner driven by the temporal orchestration
between audio and visual modalities. We propose a two-stage post-training
pipeline: (1) AVoCaDO SFT, which fine-tunes the model on a newly curated
dataset of 107K high-quality, temporally-aligned audiovisual captions; and (2)
AVoCaDO GRPO, which leverages tailored reward functions to further enhance
temporal coherence and dialogue accuracy while regularizing caption length and
reducing collapse. Experimental results demonstrate that AVoCaDO significantly
outperforms existing open-source models across four audiovisual video
captioning benchmarks, and also achieves competitive performance on the VDC and
DREAM-1K benchmark under visual-only settings.

### [312] [Mesh-Gait: A Unified Framework for Gait Recognition Through Multi-Modal Representation Learning from 2D Silhouettes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10406)
*Zhao-Yang Wang,Jieneng Chen,Jiang Liu,Yuxiang Guo,Rama Chellappa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mesh-Gait is a new approach to gait recognition, leveraging 2D silhouettes to reconstruct intermediate 3D heatmaps for improved accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 2D gait recognition struggles with issues like viewpoint variation, occlusion, and noise, while 3D approaches are computationally costly, limiting practicality for real-time use.

Method: Mesh-Gait reconstructs intermediate 3D heatmaps using 2D silhouettes and extracts discriminative features. It uses supervised learning with loss calculations based on reconstructed 3D joints, markers, and meshes.

Result: Mesh-Gait delivers state-of-the-art accuracy and robust gait recognition performance with reduced computational complexity.

Conclusion: Mesh-Gait combines 2D and 3D gait recognition efficiently, enhancing robustness and making real-time applications feasible.

Abstract: Gait recognition, a fundamental biometric technology, leverages unique
walking patterns for individual identification, typically using 2D
representations such as silhouettes or skeletons. However, these methods often
struggle with viewpoint variations, occlusions, and noise. Multi-modal
approaches that incorporate 3D body shape information offer improved robustness
but are computationally expensive, limiting their feasibility for real-time
applications. To address these challenges, we introduce Mesh-Gait, a novel
end-to-end multi-modal gait recognition framework that directly reconstructs 3D
representations from 2D silhouettes, effectively combining the strengths of
both modalities. Compared to existing methods, directly learning 3D features
from 3D joints or meshes is complex and difficult to fuse with silhouette-based
gait features. To overcome this, Mesh-Gait reconstructs 3D heatmaps as an
intermediate representation, enabling the model to effectively capture 3D
geometric information while maintaining simplicity and computational
efficiency. During training, the intermediate 3D heatmaps are gradually
reconstructed and become increasingly accurate under supervised learning, where
the loss is calculated between the reconstructed 3D joints, virtual markers,
and 3D meshes and their corresponding ground truth, ensuring precise spatial
alignment and consistent 3D structure. Mesh-Gait extracts discriminative
features from both silhouettes and reconstructed 3D heatmaps in a
computationally efficient manner. This design enables the model to capture
spatial and structural gait characteristics while avoiding the heavy overhead
of direct 3D reconstruction from RGB videos, allowing the network to focus on
motion dynamics rather than irrelevant visual details. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Mesh-Gait achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. The code will be
released upon acceptance of the paper.

### [313] [Guided Image Feature Matching using Feature Spatial Order](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10414)
*Chin-Hung Teng,Ben-Jian Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to enhance feature matching efficiency and accuracy using the concept of feature spatial order integrated with epipolar geometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image feature matching techniques are time-consuming when dealing with large sets of detected features, prompting the need for more efficient methods.

Method: The authors introduce feature spatial order into a progressive matching framework, combining it with epipolar geometry and using image alignment to mitigate rotational effects.

Result: Experiments with benchmark datasets, simulated images, and real images show improved efficiency and accuracy in feature matching compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: Integrating feature spatial order and epipolar geometry achieves significantly better feature matching, addressing time and accuracy limitations of traditional approaches.

Abstract: Image feature matching plays a vital role in many computer vision tasks.
Although many image feature detection and matching techniques have been
proposed over the past few decades, it is still time-consuming to match feature
points in two images, especially for images with a large number of detected
features. Feature spatial order can estimate the probability that a pair of
features is correct. Since it is a completely independent concept from epipolar
geometry, it can be used to complement epipolar geometry in guiding feature
match in a target region so as to improve matching efficiency. In this paper,
we integrate the concept of feature spatial order into a progressive matching
framework. We use some of the initially matched features to build a
computational model of feature spatial order and employs it to calculates the
possible spatial range of subsequent feature matches, thus filtering out
unnecessary feature matches. We also integrate it with epipolar geometry to
further improve matching efficiency and accuracy. Since the spatial order of
feature points is affected by image rotation, we propose a suitable image
alignment method from the fundamental matrix of epipolar geometry to remove the
effect of image rotation. To verify the feasibility of the proposed method, we
conduct a series of experiments, including a standard benchmark dataset,
self-generated simulated images, and real images. The results demonstrate that
our proposed method is significantly more efficient and has more accurate
feature matching than the traditional method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a multi-modal and multitask framework combining 2D and 3D gait features for enhanced gait recognition and human attribute estimation, achieving state-of-the-art results under challenging conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve gait recognition, especially in challenging conditions, by addressing the limitations of using only 2D or 3D representations and enhancing the understanding of human walking patterns.

Method: A unified transformer-based multi-modal and multitask framework that combines 2D temporal silhouettes with 3D SMPL features for gait recognition and human attribute estimation.

Result: The proposed approach outperformed state-of-the-art methods in gait recognition and provided accurate human attribute estimation on the challenging BRIAR datasets.

Conclusion: The integration of multi-modal and multitask learning enables robust gait analysis and human understanding, showcasing its effectiveness under real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Gait recognition is an important biometric for human identification at a
distance, particularly under low-resolution or unconstrained environments.
Current works typically focus on either 2D representations (e.g., silhouettes
and skeletons) or 3D representations (e.g., meshes and SMPLs), but relying on a
single modality often fails to capture the full geometric and dynamic
complexity of human walking patterns. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal
and multi-task framework that combines 2D temporal silhouettes with 3D SMPL
features for robust gait analysis. Beyond identification, we introduce a
multitask learning strategy that jointly performs gait recognition and human
attribute estimation, including age, body mass index (BMI), and gender. A
unified transformer is employed to effectively fuse multi-modal gait features
and better learn attribute-related representations, while preserving
discriminative identity cues. Extensive experiments on the large-scale BRIAR
datasets, collected under challenging conditions such as long-range distances
(up to 1 km) and extreme pitch angles (up to 50{\deg}), demonstrate that our
approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in gait recognition and provides
accurate human attribute estimation. These results highlight the promise of
multi-modal and multitask learning for advancing gait-based human understanding
in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: The study uses transfer learning and temporal modeling to predict VR-induced cybersickness, achieving improved accuracy over previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The persistent issue of cybersickness in VR limits its widespread adoption despite its potential in various fields.

Method: The study uses transfer learning with the InceptionV3 model to extract features from VR videos and employs an LSTM network to model temporal dynamics for cybersickness prediction.

Result: The approach achieves a 68.4% classification accuracy in predicting cybersickness severity, outperforming existing video-based models.

Conclusion: This research provides a more accurate tool for evaluating and mitigating cybersickness in VR and sets the stage for future studies on video-based temporal modeling to enhance VR user comfort.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of virtual reality (VR) technology, its adoption
across domains such as healthcare, education, and entertainment has grown
significantly. However, the persistent issue of cybersickness, marked by
symptoms resembling motion sickness, continues to hinder widespread acceptance
of VR. While recent research has explored multimodal deep learning approaches
leveraging data from integrated VR sensors like eye and head tracking, there
remains limited investigation into the use of video-based features for
predicting cybersickness. In this study, we address this gap by utilizing
transfer learning to extract high-level visual features from VR gameplay videos
using the InceptionV3 model pretrained on the ImageNet dataset. These features
are then passed to a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture the
temporal dynamics of the VR experience and predict cybersickness severity over
time. Our approach effectively leverages the time-series nature of video data,
achieving a 68.4% classification accuracy for cybersickness severity. This
surpasses the performance of existing models trained solely on video data,
providing a practical tool for VR developers to evaluate and mitigate
cybersickness in virtual environments. Furthermore, this work lays the
foundation for future research on video-based temporal modeling for enhancing
user comfort in VR applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal large language models struggle with fine-grained visual question answering due to a lack of explicit anchoring between textual queries and visual referents, causing hallucinations and errors.

Method: The paper proposes the HuLiRAG framework, which stages a 'what-where-reweight' reasoning cascade. It uses open-vocabulary detection (what), SAM-derived spatial masking (where), and adaptive prioritization for local-global alignment (reweight). It also involves mask-guided fine-tuning to make spatial evidence an explicit constraint.

Result: Extensive experiments show that HuLiRAG improves grounding fidelity, enhances factual consistency, and minimizes hallucinations in multimodal question answering.

Conclusion: HuLiRAG effectively advances fine-grained and trustworthy multimodal question answering by addressing the limitations of current models in grounding and reasoning.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often fail in fine-grained visual
question answering, producing hallucinations about object identities,
positions, and relations because textual queries are not explicitly anchored to
visual referents. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) alleviates some errors,
but it fails to align with human-like processing at both the retrieval and
augmentation levels. Specifically, it focuses only on global-level image
information but lacks local detail and limits reasoning about fine-grained
interactions. To overcome this limitation, we present Human-Like
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (HuLiRAG), a framework that stages multimodal
reasoning as a ``what--where--reweight'' cascade. Queries are first anchored to
candidate referents via open-vocabulary detection (what), then spatially
resolved with SAM-derived masks to recover fine-grained precision (where), and
adaptively prioritized through the trade-off between local and global alignment
(reweight). Mask-guided fine-tuning further injects spatial evidence into the
generation process, transforming grounding from a passive bias into an explicit
constraint on answer formulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this
human-like cascade improves grounding fidelity and factual consistency while
reducing hallucinations, advancing multimodal question answering toward
trustworthy reasoning.

*Kangjian Zhu,Haobo Jiang,Yigong Zhang,Jianjun Qian,Jian Yang,Jin Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MonoSE(3)-Diffusion formulates markerless robot pose estimation as a conditional denoising diffusion process, showing improvements on DREAM and RoboKeyGen datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in markerless and image-based robot pose estimation, including challenges in generating diverse, realistic training poses and improving prediction robustness.

Method: The authors propose a two-step diffusion framework: a visibility-constrained diffusion process for pose generation and a timestep-aware reverse process for pose refinement.

Result: Their method achieved a notable Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 66.75 on the most challenging dataset, outpacing current state-of-the-art methods with a 32.3% improvement.

Conclusion: MonoSE(3)-Diffusion improves model generalization and pose prediction accuracy through visibility-constrained and timestep-aware processes, showing significant benchmark performance gains.

Abstract: We propose MonoSE(3)-Diffusion, a monocular SE(3) diffusion framework that
formulates markerless, image-based robot pose estimation as a conditional
denoising diffusion process. The framework consists of two processes: a
visibility-constrained diffusion process for diverse pose augmentation and a
timestep-aware reverse process for progressive pose refinement. The diffusion
process progressively perturbs ground-truth poses to noisy transformations for
training a pose denoising network. Importantly, we integrate visibility
constraints into the process, ensuring the transformations remain within the
camera field of view. Compared to the fixed-scale perturbations used in current
methods, the diffusion process generates in-view and diverse training poses,
thereby improving the network generalization capability. Furthermore, the
reverse process iteratively predicts the poses by the denoising network and
refines pose estimates by sampling from the diffusion posterior of current
timestep, following a scheduled coarse-to-fine procedure. Moreover, the
timestep indicates the transformation scales, which guide the denoising network
to achieve more accurate pose predictions. The reverse process demonstrates
higher robustness than direct prediction, benefiting from its timestep-aware
refinement scheme. Our approach demonstrates improvements across two benchmarks
(DREAM and RoboKeyGen), achieving a notable AUC of 66.75 on the most
challenging dataset, representing a 32.3% gain over the state-of-the-art.

*Tai Le-Gia,Ahn Jaehyun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces CoDeGraph, a novel method for zero-shot image anomaly classification and segmentation in industrial scenarios, addressing issues with consistent anomalies using a community detection-based graph approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve industrial quality control through better zero-shot anomaly detection by addressing challenges posed by consistent anomalies that existing methods struggle with.

Method: Proposes CoDeGraph that detects anomalies based on a phenomenon called 'neighbor-burnout,' building an image-level graph and filtering anomalies using community detection.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on MVTec AD with significant improvements in metrics like 66.8% F1 score and 69.1% with DINOv2 backbone for segmentation.

Conclusion: CoDeGraph is effective and robust across architectures for identifying and segmenting anomalies in zero-shot scenarios, improving industrial quality control applications.

Abstract: Zero-shot image anomaly classification (AC) and segmentation (AS) are vital
for industrial quality control, detecting defects without prior training data.
Existing representation-based methods compare patch features with nearest
neighbors in unlabeled test images but struggle with consistent anomalies --
similar defects recurring across multiple images -- resulting in poor AC/AS
performance. We introduce Consistent-Anomaly Detection Graph (CoDeGraph), a
novel algorithm that identifies and filters consistent anomalies from
similarity computations. Our key insight is that normal patches in industrial
images show stable, gradually increasing similarity to other test images, while
consistent-anomaly patches exhibit abrupt similarity spikes after exhausting a
limited set of similar matches, a phenomenon we term ``neighbor-burnout.''
CoDeGraph constructs an image-level graph, with images as nodes and edges
connecting those with shared consistent-anomaly patterns, using community
detection to filter these anomalies. We provide a theoretical foundation using
Extreme Value Theory to explain the effectiveness of our approach. Experiments
on MVTec AD with the ViT-L-14-336 backbone achieve 98.3% AUROC for AC and AS
performance of 66.8% (+4.2%) F1 and 68.1% (+5.4%) AP over state-of-the-art
zero-shot methods. Using the DINOv2 backbone further improves segmentation,
yielding 69.1% (+6.5%) F1 and 71.9% (+9.2%) AP, demonstrating robustness across
architectures.

*Chen Zhong,Yuxuan Yang,Xinyue Zhang,Ruohan Ma,Yong Guo,Gang Li,Jupeng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel framework for addressing inter-rater variability in medical image segmentation by simulating collaborative decision-making using individual annotator styles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inter-rater variability due to annotator expertise and image blurriness poses challenges for achieving reliable medical image segmentation.

Method: The framework includes an Expert Signature Generator to model individual annotator styles and a Simulated Consultation Module to generate final segmentation by sampling these styles.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on CBCT and MRI datasets with Dice scores of 92.11% and 90.72%, respectively.

Conclusion: Expert disagreement is treated as informative, enabling the creation of more robust and trustworthy AI systems for medical applications.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation annotation suffers from inter-rater variability
(IRV) due to differences in annotators' expertise and the inherent blurriness
of medical images. Standard approaches that simply average expert labels are
flawed, as they discard the valuable clinical uncertainty revealed in
disagreements. We introduce a fundamentally new approach with our group
decision simulation framework, which works by mimicking the collaborative
decision-making process of a clinical panel. Under this framework, an Expert
Signature Generator (ESG) learns to represent individual annotator styles in a
unique latent space. A Simulated Consultation Module (SCM) then intelligently
generates the final segmentation by sampling from this space. This method
achieved state-of-the-art results on challenging CBCT and MRI datasets (92.11%
and 90.72% Dice scores). By treating expert disagreement as a useful signal
instead of noise, our work provides a clear path toward more robust and
trustworthy AI systems for healthcare.

### [320] [Post-TIPS Prediction via Multimodal Interaction: A Multi-Center Dataset and Framework for Survival, Complication, and Portal Pressure Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10464)
*Junhao Dong,Dejia Liu,Ruiqi Ding,Zongxing Chen,Yingjie Huang,Zhu Meng,Jianbo Zhao,Zhicheng Zhao,Fei Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MultiTIPS, a publicly accessible multi-center dataset, along with a novel multimodal framework to improve prognostic modeling for TIPS patients, addressing issues like ROI annotation, unimodal method limitations, and single-endpoint assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address challenges in TIPS prognostic modeling, such as labor-intensive ROI annotation, poor reliability of unimodal approaches, and incomplete single-endpoint predictions, compounded by the lack of publicly available datasets.

Method: A multimodal prognostic framework is developed with three main modules: dual-option segmentation for robust feature extraction, multimodal interaction techniques to enhance data integration, and multi-task prediction strategies to optimize survival, PPG, and OHE predictions.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, generalization, and interpretability, leveraging the MultiTIPS dataset.

Conclusion: This framework and dataset represent a promising step forward for clinical application, enhancing the robustness and generalizability of TIPS prognostic modeling.

Abstract: Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is an established
procedure for portal hypertension, but provides variable survival outcomes and
frequent overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE), indicating the necessity of
accurate preoperative prognostic modeling. Current studies typically build
machine learning models from preoperative CT images or clinical
characteristics, but face three key challenges: (1) labor-intensive
region-of-interest (ROI) annotation, (2) poor reliability and generalizability
of unimodal methods, and (3) incomplete assessment from single-endpoint
prediction. Moreover, the lack of publicly accessible datasets constrains
research in this field. Therefore, we present MultiTIPS, the first public
multi-center dataset for TIPS prognosis, and propose a novel multimodal
prognostic framework based on it. The framework comprises three core modules:
(1) dual-option segmentation, which integrates semi-supervised and foundation
model-based pipelines to achieve robust ROI segmentation with limited
annotations and facilitate subsequent feature extraction; (2) multimodal
interaction, where three techniques, multi-grained radiomics attention (MGRA),
progressive orthogonal disentanglement (POD), and clinically guided prognostic
enhancement (CGPE), are introduced to enable cross-modal feature interaction
and complementary representation integration, thus improving model accuracy and
robustness; and (3) multi-task prediction, where a staged training strategy is
used to perform stable optimization of survival, portal pressure gradient
(PPG), and OHE prediction for comprehensive prognostic assessment. Extensive
experiments on MultiTIPS demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method
over state-of-the-art approaches, along with strong cross-domain generalization
and interpretability, indicating its promise for clinical application. The
dataset and code are available.

### [321] [When Images Speak Louder: Mitigating Language Bias-induced Hallucinations in VLMs through Cross-Modal Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10466)
*Jinjin Cao,Zhiyang Chen,Zijun Wang,Liyuan Ma,Weijian Luo,Guojun Qi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses VLM hallucinations by introducing Cross-Modal Guidance (CMG), a training-free decoding method that reduces language bias using adaptive masking of image-token attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs struggle with generating language-fluent but image-irrelevant responses (hallucinations) due to language bias.

Method: The authors propose CMG, which adaptively masks attention weights of influential image tokens in specific transformer layers to degrade visual-language perception and reduce hallucinations.

Result: Experimental results show that CMG improves performance across hallucination-specific benchmarks and generalizes effectively, all without additional training or conditions.

Conclusion: CMG is a cost-effective and efficient method to reduce language bias and hallucinations in VLMs, improving their overall performance and applicability.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown solid ability for multimodal
understanding of both visual and language contexts. However, existing VLMs
often face severe challenges of hallucinations, meaning that VLMs tend to
generate responses that are only fluent in the language but irrelevant to
images in previous contexts. To address this issue, we analyze how language
bias contributes to hallucinations and then introduce Cross-Modal
Guidance(CMG), a training-free decoding method that addresses the
hallucinations by leveraging the difference between the output distributions of
the original model and the one with degraded visual-language attention. In
practice, we adaptively mask the attention weight of the most influential image
tokens in selected transformer layers to corrupt the visual-language perception
as a concrete type of degradation. Such a degradation-induced decoding
emphasizes the perception of visual contexts and therefore significantly
reduces language bias without harming the ability of VLMs. In experiment
sections, we conduct comprehensive studies. All results demonstrate the
superior advantages of CMG with neither additional conditions nor training
costs. We also quantitatively show CMG can improve different VLM's performance
on hallucination-specific benchmarks and generalize effectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAGLFNet is a new semantic segmentation framework for LiDAR point clouds, enhancing performance and real-time capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR is essential for autonomous systems, but extracting structured semantic details from unstructured point clouds is challenging.

Method: The paper introduces DAGLFNet with modules like Global-Local Feature Fusion, Multi-Branch Feature Extraction, and attention-based feature fusion.

Result: DAGLFNet achieved competitive validation scores: 69.83% with SemanticKITTI and 78.65% with nuScenes datasets.

Conclusion: DAGLFNet successfully balances efficiency and performance, making it suitable for real-time LiDAR-based applications.

Abstract: Environmental perception systems play a critical role in high-precision
mapping and autonomous navigation, with LiDAR serving as a core sensor that
provides accurate 3D point cloud data. How to efficiently process unstructured
point clouds while extracting structured semantic information remains a
significant challenge, and in recent years, numerous pseudo-image-based
representation methods have emerged to achieve a balance between efficiency and
performance. However, they often overlook the structural and semantic details
of point clouds, resulting in limited feature fusion and discriminability. In
this work, we propose DAGLFNet, a pseudo-image-based semantic segmentation
framework designed to extract discriminative features. First, the Global-Local
Feature Fusion Encoding module is used to enhance the correlation among local
features within a set and capture global contextual information. Second, the
Multi-Branch Feature Extraction network is employed to capture more
neighborhood information and enhance the discriminability of contour features.
Finally, a Feature Fusion via Deep Feature-guided Attention mechanism is
introduced to improve the precision of cross-channel feature fusion.
Experimental evaluations show that DAGLFNet achieves 69.83\% and 78.65\% on the
validation sets of SemanticKITTI and nuScenes, respectively. The method
balances high performance with real-time capability, demonstrating great
potential for LiDAR-based real-time applications.

*Deng Li,Jun Shao,Bohao Xing,Rong Gao,Bihan Wen,Heikki Kälviäinen,Xin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes MSF-Mamba, an enhancement over existing Mamba for micro-gesture recognition by focusing on motion-aware state fusion and addressing its limitations in local spatiotemporal modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Micro-gesture recognition requires accurate modeling of both long-range and local spatiotemporal dependencies, which existing CNN and transformer models struggle with due to receptive field limitations and high computational costs.

Method: The proposed MSF-Mamba incorporates a motion-aware state fusion module based on central frame difference (CFD). It also introduces a multiscale version (MSF-Mamba+) with multiscale fusion and adaptive scale weighting for improved modeling.

Result: Experiments on two public MGR datasets demonstrate that MSF-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming CNN, Transformer, and SSM-based models while being computationally efficient.

Conclusion: MSF-Mamba and its multiscale variant effectively address the limitations of vanilla Mamba and demonstrate superior performance in micro-gesture recognition tasks, making them promising methods for efficient and accurate MGR.

Abstract: Micro-gesture recognition (MGR) targets the identification of subtle and
fine-grained human motions and requires accurate modeling of both long-range
and local spatiotemporal dependencies. While CNNs are effective at capturing
local patterns, they struggle with long-range dependencies due to their limited
receptive fields. Transformer-based models address this limitation through
self-attention mechanisms but suffer from high computational costs. Recently,
Mamba has shown promise as an efficient model, leveraging state space models
(SSMs) to enable linear-time processing However, directly applying the vanilla
Mamba to MGR may not be optimal. This is because Mamba processes inputs as 1D
sequences, with state updates relying solely on the previous state, and thus
lacks the ability to model local spatiotemporal dependencies. In addition,
previous methods lack a design of motion-awareness, which is crucial in MGR. To
overcome these limitations, we propose motion-aware state fusion mamba
(MSF-Mamba), which enhances Mamba with local spatiotemporal modeling by fusing
local contextual neighboring states. Our design introduces a motion-aware state
fusion module based on central frame difference (CFD). Furthermore, a
multiscale version named MSF-Mamba+ has been proposed. Specifically, MSF-Mamba
supports multiscale motion-aware state fusion, as well as an adaptive scale
weighting module that dynamically weighs the fused states across different
scales. These enhancements explicitly address the limitations of vanilla Mamba
by enabling motion-aware local spatiotemporal modeling, allowing MSF-Mamba and
MSF-Mamba to effectively capture subtle motion cues for MGR. Experiments on two
public MGR datasets demonstrate that even the lightweight version, namely,
MSF-Mamba, achieves SoTA performance, outperforming existing CNN-,
Transformer-, and SSM-based models while maintaining high efficiency.

### [324] [Towards Self-Refinement of Vision-Language Models with Triangular Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10487)
*Yunlong Deng,Guangyi Chen,Tianpei Gu,Lingjing Kong,Yan Li,Zeyu Tang,Kun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores Vision-Language Models (VLMs) advancing without external supervised data, proposing a self-refinement framework that ensures consistent learning using a Triangular Consistency principle, and presenting modest improvements in benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the largely untapped potential of VLMs to self-learn and refine without the need for supervised instruction or external inputs, challenging the conventional dependence on labeled data.

Method: A self-refinement framework is proposed based on a Triangular Consistency principle. The process includes (1) multi-task instruction tuning, (2) generation of synthetic data using image-query-answer triplets with consistency filtering, and (3) model updating with filtered data.

Result: The method enabled VLMs to autonomously achieve consistent and reliable improvements across various benchmarks using synthetic data without external supervision.

Conclusion: The self-refinement framework demonstrates that VLMs can generate and utilize high-quality training data on their own, pointing toward innovative, autonomous learning dynamics for VLMs without human intervention.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) integrate visual knowledge with the analytical
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) through supervised visual
instruction tuning, using image-question-answer triplets. However, the
potential of VLMs trained without supervised instruction remains largely
unexplored. This study validates that VLMs possess inherent self-refinement
capabilities, enabling them to generate high-quality supervised data without
external inputs and thereby learn autonomously. Specifically, to stimulate the
self-refinement ability of VLMs, we propose a self-refinement framework based
on a Triangular Consistency principle: within the image-query-answer triangle,
any masked elements should be consistently and accurately reconstructed. The
framework involves three steps: (1) We enable the instruction generation
ability of VLMs by adding multi-task instruction tuning like
image$\rightarrow$question-answer or image-answer$\rightarrow$question. (2) We
generate image-query-answer triplets from unlabeled images and use the
Triangular Consistency principle for filtering. (3) The model is further
updated using the filtered synthetic data. To investigate the underlying
mechanisms behind this self-refinement capability, we conduct a theoretical
analysis from a causal perspective. Using the widely recognized LLaVA-1.5 as
our baseline, our experiments reveal that the model can autonomously achieve
consistent, though deliberately modest, improvements across multiple benchmarks
without any external supervision, such as human annotations or environmental
feedback. We expect that the insights of this study on the self-refinement
ability of VLMs can inspire future research on the learning mechanism of VLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HARoPE, a head-wise adaptive extension to Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) aimed at addressing its limitations in fine-grained image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve positional encoding in transformers for tasks like image generation where standard RoPE struggles to capture complex structural biases.

Method: HARoPE adds a learnable linear transformation based on singular value decomposition (SVD) before rotary mapping, enabling dynamic frequency reallocation and other enhancements.

Result: Experiments on datasets like ImageNet show HARoPE outperforms RoPE baselines and offers consistent improvements in image generation tasks.

Conclusion: HARoPE provides an adaptable, lightweight solution for enhancing positional awareness in transformer-based models, improving their performance in image generation.

Abstract: Transformers rely on explicit positional encoding to model structure in data.
While Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) excels in 1D domains, its application to
image generation reveals significant limitations such as fine-grained spatial
relation modeling, color cues, and object counting. This paper identifies key
limitations of standard multi-dimensional RoPE-rigid frequency allocation,
axis-wise independence, and uniform head treatment-in capturing the complex
structural biases required for fine-grained image generation. We propose
HARoPE, a head-wise adaptive extension that inserts a learnable linear
transformation parameterized via singular value decomposition (SVD) before the
rotary mapping. This lightweight modification enables dynamic frequency
reallocation, semantic alignment of rotary planes, and head-specific positional
receptive fields while rigorously preserving RoPE's relative-position property.
Extensive experiments on class-conditional ImageNet and text-to-image
generation (Flux and MMDiT) demonstrate that HARoPE consistently improves
performance over strong RoPE baselines and other extensions. The method serves
as an effective drop-in replacement, offering a principled and adaptable
solution for enhancing positional awareness in transformer-based image
generative models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces DKPMV, a 6D pose estimation method for textureless objects using RGB images without relying on depth data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address challenges in 6D pose estimation of textureless objects, specifically frequent loss of depth information and insufficient use of multi-view geometric cues in existing methods.

Method: They propose DKPMV, a pipeline that uses only RGB images and incorporates dense keypoint fusion with enhanced attentional aggregation, symmetry-aware training, and a three-stage pose optimization strategy.

Result: DKPMV outperforms state-of-the-art multi-view methods that use RGB images and even surpasses some RGB-D-based methods according to experiments on the ROBI dataset.

Conclusion: The approach effectively demonstrates the feasibility and improved performance of 6D pose estimation using RGB data alone, providing a valuable solution for industrial robotic applications.

Abstract: 6D pose estimation of textureless objects is valuable for industrial robotic
applications, yet remains challenging due to the frequent loss of depth
information. Current multi-view methods either rely on depth data or
insufficiently exploit multi-view geometric cues, limiting their performance.
In this paper, we propose DKPMV, a pipeline that achieves dense keypoint-level
fusion using only multi-view RGB images as input. We design a three-stage
progressive pose optimization strategy that leverages dense multi-view keypoint
geometry information. To enable effective dense keypoint fusion, we enhance the
keypoint network with attentional aggregation and symmetry-aware training,
improving prediction accuracy and resolving ambiguities on symmetric objects.
Extensive experiments on the ROBI dataset demonstrate that DKPMV outperforms
state-of-the-art multi-view RGB approaches and even surpasses the RGB-D methods
in the majority of cases. The code will be available soon.

*Yuteng Ye,Zheng Zhang,Qinchuan Zhang,Di Wang,Youjia Zhang,Wenxiao Zhang,Wei Yang,Yuan Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Jigsaw3D, a method for fast and consistent 3D style transfer using multi-view diffusion and a jigsaw operation to decouple style from object semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in 3D style transfer such as heavy optimization processes and the entanglement of style with object semantics.

Method: The method uses a jigsaw operation (shuffling and masking reference patches) to suppress semantics and extract style cues. These cues are incorporated via cross-attention in a multi-view diffusion model for view-consistent stylization before applying textures to 3D meshes.

Result: Jigsaw3D achieves high style fidelity and multi-view consistency across benchmarks. It allows for partial reference stylization, multi-object scene styling, and tileable texture generation, with lower latency than existing methods.

Conclusion: Jigsaw3D represents an efficient and generalized approach to 3D style transfer, overcoming limitations of previous methods in preserving consistency and disentangling style from semantics.

Abstract: Controllable 3D style transfer seeks to restyle a 3D asset so that its
textures match a reference image while preserving the integrity and multi-view
consistency. The prevalent methods either rely on direct reference style token
injection or score-distillation from 2D diffusion models, which incurs heavy
per-scene optimization and often entangles style with semantic content. We
introduce Jigsaw3D, a multi-view diffusion based pipeline that decouples style
from content and enables fast, view-consistent stylization. Our key idea is to
leverage the jigsaw operation - spatial shuffling and random masking of
reference patches - to suppress object semantics and isolate stylistic
statistics (color palettes, strokes, textures). We integrate these style cues
into a multi-view diffusion model via reference-to-view cross-attention,
producing view-consistent stylized renderings conditioned on the input mesh.
The renders are then style-baked onto the surface to yield seamless textures.
Across standard 3D stylization benchmarks, Jigsaw3D achieves high style
fidelity and multi-view consistency with substantially lower latency, and
generalizes to masked partial reference stylization, multi-object scene
styling, and tileable texture generation. Project page is available at:

annotating part segmentation, kinematic types, and motion trajectories. We
present REACT3D, a scalable zero-shot framework that converts static 3D scenes

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VideoReward Thinker (VR-Thinker), a multimodal reward model for visual reasoning, resolving issues like context limitations and hallucination in video-based tasks, achieving state-of-the-art benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal reward models struggle with context limitation due to large visual input sizes and tend to hallucinate or forget information during chain-of-thought reasoning.

Method: The proposed framework, VR-Thinker, incorporates visual reasoning operations and a configurable visual memory window into multimodal reward modeling. The model is trained via a three-step reinforcement fine-tuning process: Cold Start, Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning, and Group Relative Policy Optimization.

Result: VR-Thinker achieves significant improvements in reasoning accuracy on video preference benchmarks, with scores of 80.5% on VideoGen Reward, 82.3% on GenAI-Bench, and 75.6% on MJ-Bench-Video, particularly excelling with longer videos.

Conclusion: 'Thinking-with-image' modeling, as implemented in VR-Thinker, effectively addresses existing limitations in multimodal reward models, paving the way for improved reasoning fidelity and reliability in visual generative tasks.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal reward models (RMs) have substantially
improved post-training for visual generative models. However, current RMs face
inherent limitations: (1) visual inputs consume large context budgets, forcing
fewer frames and causing loss of fine-grained details; and (2) all visual
information is packed into the initial prompt, exacerbating hallucination and
forgetting during chain-of-thought reasoning. To overcome these issues, we
introduce VideoReward Thinker (VR-Thinker), a thinking-with-image framework
that equips the RM with visual reasoning operations (e.g., select frame) and a
configurable visual memory window. This allows the RM to actively acquire and
update visual evidence within context limits, improving reasoning fidelity and
reliability. We activate visual reasoning via a reinforcement fine-tuning
pipeline: (i) Cold Start with curated visual chain-of-thought data to distill
basic reasoning skills and operation formatting; (ii) select samples whose
per-dimension and overall judgments are all correct, then conduct Rejection
sampling Fine-Tuning on these high-quality traces to further enhance reasoning;

*Xi Zhang,Xiaolin Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the common drawback of limited receptive field in LUT-based fast CNN inference by proposing techniques to expand the receptive field without increasing table size, enhancing speed and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need to overcome the limited receptive field in LUT methods for fast CNN inference, which hampers their performance despite their speed advantage.

Method: The paper introduces techniques including a novel lattice vector quantizer for adaptive resolution allocation, irregular dilated convolutions, and a U-shaped cascaded LUT structure to expand the receptive field without increasing space complexity.

Result: The proposed techniques demonstrate a balanced improvement in speed, accuracy, and memory efficiency, with significant enhancements over existing LUT methods.

Conclusion: Innovative methods like lattice vector quantization and receptive field expansion strategies effectively address limitations in LUT-driven CNN inference, achieving better performance while maintaining space efficiency.

Abstract: Recently, several look-up table (LUT) methods were developed to greatly
expedite the inference of CNNs in a classical strategy of trading space for
speed. However, these LUT methods suffer from a common drawback of limited
receptive field of the convolution kernels due to the combinatorial explosion
of table size. This research aims to expand the CNN receptive field with a
fixed table size, thereby enhancing the performance of LUT-driven fast CNN
inference while maintaining the same space complexity. To achieve this goal,
various techniques are proposed. The main contribution is a novel approach of
learning an optimal lattice vector quantizer that adaptively allocates the
quantization resolution across data dimensions based on their significance to
the inference task. In addition, the lattice vector quantizer offers an
inherently more accurate approximation of CNN kernels than scalar quantizer as
used in current practice. Furthermore, we introduce other receptive field
expansion strategies, including irregular dilated convolutions and a U-shaped
cascaded LUT structure, designed to capture multi-level contextual information
without inflating table size. Together, these innovations allow our approach to
effectively balance speed, accuracy, and memory efficiency, demonstrating
significant improvements over existing LUT methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges posed by the differences in architecture, learning objectives, and representation strategies in previous segmentation models.

Method: COSINE integrates foundation models and a SegDecoder to process input images and multi-modal prompts (text or image) while aligning and modeling their interaction for segmentation.

Result: COSINE achieves notable performance improvements in open-vocabulary and in-context segmentation tasks, surpassing prior approaches.

Conclusion: The combination of visual and textual prompts in COSINE enhances generalization capabilities, outperforming single-modality frameworks.

Abstract: In this work, we present COSINE, a unified open-world segmentation model that
consolidates open-vocabulary segmentation and in-context segmentation with
multi-modal prompts (e.g., text and image). COSINE exploits foundation models
to extract representations for an input image and corresponding multi-modal
prompts, and a SegDecoder to align these representations, model their
interaction, and obtain masks specified by input prompts across different
granularities. In this way, COSINE overcomes architectural discrepancies,
divergent learning objectives, and distinct representation learning strategies
of previous pipelines for open-vocabulary segmentation and in-context
segmentation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that COSINE has significant
performance improvements in both open-vocabulary and in-context segmentation
tasks. Our exploratory analyses highlight that the synergistic collaboration
between using visual and textual prompts leads to significantly improved
generalization over single-modality approaches.

Result: The system achieves high accuracy and robustness across multiple international datasets, demonstrating its superior performance compared to recent segmentation-free approaches.

Conclusion: Embedding pattern analysis within ALPR enhances adaptability and accuracy, making it suitable for intelligent transportation and surveillance applications under varied real-world conditions.

Abstract: This work presents a pattern-aware framework for automatic license plate
recognition (ALPR), designed to operate reliably across diverse plate layouts
and challenging real-world conditions. The proposed system consists of a
modern, high-precision detection network followed by a recognition stage that
integrates a transformer-based vision model with an iterative language
modelling mechanism. This unified recognition stage performs character
identification and post-OCR refinement in a seamless process, learning the
structural patterns and formatting rules specific to license plates without
relying on explicit heuristic corrections or manual layout classification.
Through this design, the system jointly optimizes visual and linguistic cues,
enables iterative refinement to improve OCR accuracy under noise, distortion,
and unconventional fonts, and achieves layout-independent recognition across
multiple international datasets (IR-LPR, UFPR-ALPR, AOLP). Experimental results
demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness compared to recent
segmentation-free approaches, highlighting how embedding pattern analysis

*Binyu Zhao,Wei Zhang,Zhaonian Zou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Modality Capability Enhancement (MCE) addresses imbalanced missing modalities in multi-modal learning by dynamically balancing learning progress and enhancing feature semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to solve issues related to handling missing modalities in multi-modal learning, particularly under imbalanced missing rates, which cause inconsistencies and feature degradation.

Method: MCE introduces two components: Learning Capability Enhancement (LCE) for dynamic balance in learning progress and Representation Capability Enhancement (RCE) for improving feature quality via subset prediction and cross-modal completion.

Result: MCE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in four multi-modal benchmarks across various missing modality configurations.

Conclusion: The proposed MCE method significantly enhances multi-modal learning robustness against missing modalities, showing its practical viability in challenging real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Multi-modal learning has made significant advances across diverse pattern
recognition applications. However, handling missing modalities, especially
under imbalanced missing rates, remains a major challenge. This imbalance
triggers a vicious cycle: modalities with higher missing rates receive fewer
updates, leading to inconsistent learning progress and representational
degradation that further diminishes their contribution. Existing methods
typically focus on global dataset-level balancing, often overlooking critical
sample-level variations in modality utility and the underlying issue of
degraded feature quality. We propose Modality Capability Enhancement (MCE) to
tackle these limitations. MCE includes two synergistic components: i) Learning
Capability Enhancement (LCE), which introduces multi-level factors to
dynamically balance modality-specific learning progress, and ii) Representation
Capability Enhancement (RCE), which improves feature semantics and robustness
through subset prediction and cross-modal completion tasks. Comprehensive
evaluations on four multi-modal benchmarks show that MCE consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods under various missing configurations. The

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GLOFNet, a multimodal dataset to advance monitoring and prediction of Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the lack of harmonized multimodal datasets required for predictive research on rare yet destructive GLOFs in high mountain regions.

Method: Sentinel-2 imagery, NASA velocity products, and MODIS temperature data were processed, normalized, and harmonized to create the GLOFNet dataset, tackling issues like cloud contamination and class imbalance.

Result: GLOFNet reveals seasonal glacier velocity cycles, a long-term temperature increase (~0.8 K/decade), and spatial heterogeneity in glacier conditions.

Conclusion: The publicly available GLOFNet dataset offers a structured basis for improving hazard prediction using multimodal deep learning techniques.

Abstract: Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) are rare but destructive hazards in high
mountain regions, yet predictive research is hindered by fragmented and
unimodal data. Most prior efforts emphasize post-event mapping, whereas
forecasting requires harmonized datasets that combine visual indicators with
physical precursors. We present GLOFNet, a multimodal dataset for GLOF
monitoring and prediction, focused on the Shisper Glacier in the Karakoram. It
integrates three complementary sources: Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery for
spatial monitoring, NASA ITS_LIVE velocity products for glacier kinematics, and
MODIS Land Surface Temperature records spanning over two decades. Preprocessing
included cloud masking, quality filtering, normalization, temporal
interpolation, augmentation, and cyclical encoding, followed by harmonization
across modalities. Exploratory analysis reveals seasonal glacier velocity
cycles, long-term warming of ~0.8 K per decade, and spatial heterogeneity in
cryospheric conditions. The resulting dataset, GLOFNet, is publicly available
to support future research in glacial hazard prediction. By addressing
challenges such as class imbalance, cloud contamination, and coarse resolution,
GLOFNet provides a structured foundation for benchmarking multimodal deep
learning approaches to rare hazard prediction.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an enhanced object detection algorithm, MRS-YOLO, achieving higher accuracy and efficiency in detecting foreign objects on railway transmission lines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses challenges in the detection of foreign objects on transmission lines under a railway environment, such as missed detections, false detections, and inefficiency.

Method: The method involves proposing an improved YOLO11-based algorithm called MRS-YOLO, incorporating modules like MAKDF, RCFPN, SC_Detect, and channel pruning to enhance feature extraction, fusion, and efficiency.

Result: Experimental results show improvements in mAP50 (94.8%, up by 0.7%) and mAP50:95 (86.4%, up by 2.3%), with a reduction in Parameters (44.2%) and GFLOPs (17.5%).

Conclusion: MRS-YOLO demonstrates superior capability and efficiency for foreign object detection in railway environments, proving its practical application viability.

Abstract: Aiming at the problems of missed detection, false detection and low detection
efficiency in transmission line foreign object detection under railway
environment, we proposed an improved algorithm MRS-YOLO based on YOLO11.
Firstly, a multi-scale Adaptive Kernel Depth Feature Fusion (MAKDF) module is
proposed and fused with the C3k2 module to form C3k2_MAKDF, which enhances the
model's feature extraction capability for foreign objects of different sizes
and shapes. Secondly, a novel Re-calibration Feature Fusion Pyramid Network
(RCFPN) is designed as a neck structure to enhance the model's ability to
integrate and utilize multi-level features effectively. Then, Spatial and
Channel Reconstruction Detect Head (SC_Detect) based on spatial and channel
preprocessing is designed to enhance the model's overall detection performance.
Finally, the channel pruning technique is used to reduce the redundancy of the
improved model, drastically reduce Parameters and Giga Floating Point
Operations Per Second (GFLOPs), and improve the detection efficiency. The
experimental results show that the mAP50 and mAP50:95 of the MRS-YOLO algorithm
proposed in this paper are improved to 94.8% and 86.4%, respectively, which are
0.7 and 2.3 percentage points higher compared to the baseline, while Parameters
and GFLOPs are reduced by 44.2% and 17.5%, respectively. It is demonstrated
that the improved algorithm can be better applied to the task of foreign object
detection in railroad transmission lines.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a deep semi-supervised learning approach to overcome the labeled data shortage in weed species classification, showing robust results on the DeepWeeds dataset compared to fully supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the problem of weed identification in precision agriculture, which faces challenges due to similarities between weeds and crops, environmental variability, and the scarcity of labeled data for training deep learning models.

Method: A deep semi-supervised approach is proposed, combining consistency regularization with similarity learning. A deep auto-encoder architecture is developed and evaluated on the DeepWeeds dataset.

Result: Experiments demonstrated the method's effectiveness and robustness in comparison to state-of-the-art fully supervised models, including performance under noisy conditions. Ablation studies were also conducted for in-depth analysis.

Conclusion: The proposed method improves weed species classification significantly, especially in scenarios with limited labeled data, making it practical for precision agriculture applications.

Abstract: Weed species classification represents an important step for the development
of automated targeting systems that allow the adoption of precision agriculture
practices. To reduce costs and yield losses caused by their presence. The
identification of weeds is a challenging problem due to their shared
similarities with crop plants and the variability related to the differences in
terms of their types. Along with the variations in relation to changes in field
conditions. Moreover, to fully benefit from deep learning-based methods, large
fully annotated datasets are needed. This requires time intensive and laborious
process for data labeling, which represents a limitation in agricultural
applications. Hence, for the aim of improving the utilization of the unlabeled
data, regarding conditions of scarcity in terms of the labeled data available
during the learning phase and provide robust and high classification
performance. We propose a deep semi-supervised approach, that combines
consistency regularization with similarity learning. Through our developed deep
auto-encoder architecture, experiments realized on the DeepWeeds dataset and
inference in noisy conditions demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of
our method in comparison to state-of-the-art fully supervised deep learning
models. Furthermore, we carried out ablation studies for an extended analysis
of our proposed joint learning strategy.

*Zhengrong Yue,Haiyu Zhang,Xiangyu Zeng,Boyu Chen,Chenting Wang,Shaobin Zhuang,Lu Dong,KunPeng Du,Yi Wang,Limin Wang,Yali Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces UniFlow, a unified and generic tokenizer for visual understanding and generation that overcomes existing limitations by combining pre-trained visual encoders and efficient reconstruction techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to resolve the performance trade-off in existing tokenizers between high-level semantic abstraction for visual understanding and low-level pixel reconstruction for visual generation.

Method: The proposed UniFlow framework uses layer-wise adaptive self-distillation applied to pre-trained visual encoders to balance understanding and generation. It also incorporates a patch-wise pixel flow decoder for efficient and high-fidelity pixel reconstruction, leveraging semantic features to ensure synergy between the two tasks.

Result: UniFlow demonstrates superior performance across 13 benchmarks, showing a 7.75% advantage in visual understanding tasks over TokenFlow-XL while achieving competitive results in visual reconstruction and generation compared to UniTok.

Conclusion: UniFlow resolves the key conflict in tokenizers, advancing universal modeling for robust and efficient visual tasks. It achieves a balanced outcome for both understanding and generation with notable efficiency and performance improvements.

Abstract: Tokenizer is a crucial component for both visual understanding and
generation. To advance toward the ultimate goal of universal modeling, recent
research has focused on developing a unified tokenizer. However, existing
tokenizers face a significant performance trade-off between understanding and
generation, stemming from the inherent conflict between high-level semantic
abstraction and low-level pixel reconstruction. To tackle this challenge, we
propose a generic and unified tokenizer, namely UniFlow, by flexibly adapting
any visual encoder with a concise reconstruction decoder. Specifically, we
introduce layer-wise adaptive self-distillation applied to the well-pretrained
visual encoders, which enables UniFlow to simultaneously inherit the strong
semantic features for visual understanding and flexibly adapt to model
fine-grained details for visual generation. Moreover, we propose a lightweight
patch-wise pixel flow decoder, which efficiently achieves high-fidelity pixel
reconstruction by modeling a conditional flow from the noisy state back to the
patch-wise pixel domain. By leveraging the semantic features as visual
conditions for the decoder, we effectively alleviate the training conflicts
between understanding and generation. Furthermore, the patch-wise learning
strategy simplifies the data distribution, thereby improving training
efficiency. Extensive experiments across 13 challenging benchmarks spanning 7
widely studied visual understanding and generation tasks demonstrate that
UniFlow achieves a win-win outcome. For instance, our 7B UniFlow-XL not only
surpasses the 14B TokenFlow-XL by 7.75% on average understanding benchmarks,
but also achieves competitive results in both visual reconstruction and
generation, surpassing UniTok by 0.15 in rFID and 0.09 in gFID (without
guidance), respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents Diff-ABFlow, a new optical flow estimation framework utilizing diffusion models to handle challenges in degraded high-speed and low-light scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optical flow estimation struggles in high-speed and low-light scenes due to motion blur, noise, and insufficient illumination, which traditional methods fail to adequately address.

Method: Diff-ABFlow combines diffusion models with frame-event appearance-boundary fusion to mitigate the impact of degraded visual features.

Result: The new framework addresses issues in existing methods by learning mappings from noisy to clear flows, enhancing performance in challenging visual conditions.

Conclusion: Diff-ABFlow provides a promising solution for optical flow estimation in degraded scenarios, leveraging the strengths of both frame and event cameras.

Abstract: Optical flow estimation has achieved promising results in conventional scenes
but faces challenges in high-speed and low-light scenes, which suffer from
motion blur and insufficient illumination. These conditions lead to weakened
texture and amplified noise and deteriorate the appearance saturation and
boundary completeness of frame cameras, which are necessary for motion feature
matching. In degraded scenes, the frame camera provides dense appearance
saturation but sparse boundary completeness due to its long imaging time and
low dynamic range. In contrast, the event camera offers sparse appearance
saturation, while its short imaging time and high dynamic range gives rise to
dense boundary completeness. Traditionally, existing methods utilize feature
fusion or domain adaptation to introduce event to improve boundary
completeness. However, the appearance features are still deteriorated, which
severely affects the mostly adopted discriminative models that learn the
mapping from visual features to motion fields and generative models that
generate motion fields based on given visual features. So we introduce
diffusion models that learn the mapping from noising flow to clear flow, which
is not affected by the deteriorated visual features. Therefore, we propose a
novel optical flow estimation framework Diff-ABFlow based on diffusion models
with frame-event appearance-boundary fusion.

*Shizhen Zhao,Jiahui Liu,Xin Wen,Haoru Tan,Xiaojuan Qi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pre-trained vision foundation models have shown promise for Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection. Fine-tuning enhances their performance, but challenges arise in large semantic spaces. Proposed methods—MoFE and Dynamic-β Mixup—address these issues effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore the potential of vision foundation models for OOD detection, given their ability to learn robust features but underexplored applicability in this domain.

Method: The study analyzes pre-trained DINOv2 models for OOD detection and introduces the MoFE module to partition feature spaces and refine decision boundaries. Additionally, the Dynamic-β Mixup strategy adjusts interpolation weights for enhanced feature learning.

Result: Models equipped with MoFE and Dynamic-β Mixup significantly outperform existing OOD detection methods, particularly in scenarios with challenging semantic spaces.

Conclusion: Vision foundation models are promising for OOD detection, but challenges in complex semantic spaces require strategies like MoFE and Dynamic-β Mixup to optimize their capabilities effectively.

Abstract: Pre-trained vision foundation models have transformed many computer vision
tasks. Despite their strong ability to learn discriminative and generalizable
features crucial for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, their impact on this
task remains underexplored. Motivated by this gap, we systematically
investigate representative vision foundation models for OOD detection. Our
findings reveal that a pre-trained DINOv2 model, even without fine-tuning on
in-domain (ID) data, naturally provides a highly discriminative feature space
for OOD detection, achieving performance comparable to existing
state-of-the-art methods without requiring complex designs. Beyond this, we
explore how fine-tuning foundation models on in-domain (ID) data can enhance
OOD detection. However, we observe that the performance of vision foundation
models remains unsatisfactory in scenarios with a large semantic space. This is
due to the increased complexity of decision boundaries as the number of
categories grows, which complicates the optimization process. To mitigate this,
we propose the Mixture of Feature Experts (MoFE) module, which partitions
features into subspaces, effectively capturing complex data distributions and
refining decision boundaries. Further, we introduce a Dynamic-$\beta$ Mixup
strategy, which samples interpolation weights from a dynamic beta distribution.
This adapts to varying levels of learning difficulty across categories,
improving feature learning for more challenging categories. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, significantly
outperforming baseline methods.

TL;DR: FSVG facilitates visual grounding by selecting relevant visual features, balancing accuracy and efficiency without iterative procedures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimize visual grounding by reducing computational overhead while maintaining high performance.

Method: FSVG integrates linguistic and visual modalities in a parallel, streamlined architecture, using similarity-based feature selection for efficient localization.

Result: FSVG demonstrates superior performance in accuracy and efficiency on multiple benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: FSVG simplifies existing approaches and sets a new standard for visual grounding solutions, providing both practical utility and implementation ease.

Abstract: Visual grounding aims to predict the locations of target objects specified by
textual descriptions. For this task with linguistic and visual modalities,
there is a latest research line that focuses on only selecting the
linguistic-relevant visual regions for object localization to reduce the
computational overhead. Albeit achieving impressive performance, it is
iteratively performed on different image scales, and at every iteration,
linguistic features and visual features need to be stored in a cache, incurring
extra overhead. To facilitate the implementation, in this paper, we propose a
feature selection-based simple yet effective baseline for visual grounding,
called FSVG. Specifically, we directly encapsulate the linguistic and visual
modalities into an overall network architecture without complicated iterative
procedures, and utilize the language in parallel as guidance to facilitate the
interaction between linguistic modal and visual modal for extracting effective
visual features. Furthermore, to reduce the computational cost, during the
visual feature learning, we introduce a similarity-based feature selection
mechanism to only exploit language-related visual features for faster
prediction. Extensive experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets
comprehensively substantiate that the proposed FSVG achieves a better balance
between accuracy and efficiency beyond the current state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLM post-training methods, SFT and RLVR, have limitations such as sub-optimal performance for SFT and RLVR's inability to handle tasks beyond the model's knowledge base. A more holistic approach is needed.

Method: ViSurf integrates SFT and RLVR into a single-stage framework by injecting ground-truth labels into RLVR rollouts and employing three novel reward control strategies to stabilize training.

Result: ViSurf outperforms standalone SFT, RLVR, and the two-stage SFT→RLVR approach across diverse benchmarks, showcasing improved performance and training efficiency.

Conclusion: ViSurf successfully combines external supervision and internal reinforcement, providing a unified framework for LVLM post-training that addresses limitations of existing methods while achieving superior outcomes.

Abstract: Typical post-training paradigms for Large Vision-and-Language Models (LVLMs)
include Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable
Rewards (RLVR). SFT leverages external guidance to inject new knowledge,
whereas RLVR utilizes internal reinforcement to enhance reasoning capabilities
and overall performance. However, our analysis reveals that SFT often leads to
sub-optimal performance, while RLVR struggles with tasks that exceed the
model's internal knowledge base. To address these limitations, we propose
ViSurf (\textbf{Vi}sual \textbf{Su}pervised-and-\textbf{R}einforcement
\textbf{F}ine-Tuning), a unified post-training paradigm that integrates the
strengths of both SFT and RLVR within a single stage. We analyze the derivation
of the SFT and RLVR objectives to establish the ViSurf objective, providing a
unified perspective on these two paradigms. The core of ViSurf involves
injecting ground-truth labels into the RLVR rollouts, thereby providing
simultaneous external supervision and internal reinforcement. Furthermore, we
introduce three novel reward control strategies to stabilize and optimize the
training process. Extensive experiments across several diverse benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of ViSurf, outperforming both individual SFT,
RLVR, and two-stage SFT \textrightarrow RLVR. In-depth analysis corroborates
these findings, validating the derivation and design principles of ViSurf.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual evaluation methods are limited to single tasks, highlighting the need for a holistic approach to address multi-task quality reasoning in visual assessments.

Method: OmniQuality-R uses rejection sampling to create a chain-of-thought dataset for supervised fine-tuning and post-training with Gaussian-based rewards, incorporating techniques like STD filtering and entropy gating during reinforcement learning.

Result: OmniQuality-R demonstrates effectiveness in evaluating multi-dimensional quality across aesthetic, technical, and text-image alignment tasks.

Conclusion: OmniQuality-R successfully transforms multi-task visual quality reasoning into reliable, interpretable reward signals, improving robustness, generalization, and policy optimization.

Abstract: Current visual evaluation approaches are typically constrained to a single
task. To address this, we propose OmniQuality-R, a unified reward modeling
framework that transforms multi-task quality reasoning into continuous and
interpretable reward signals for policy optimization. Inspired by subjective
experiments, where participants are given task-specific instructions outlining
distinct assessment principles prior to evaluation, we propose OmniQuality-R, a
structured reward modeling framework that transforms multi-dimensional
reasoning into continuous and interpretable reward signals. To enable this, we
construct a reasoning-enhanced reward modeling dataset by sampling informative
plan-reason trajectories via rejection sampling, forming a reliable
chain-of-thought (CoT) dataset for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Building on
this, we apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for post-training,
using a Gaussian-based reward to support continuous score prediction. To
further stabilize the training and improve downstream generalization, we
incorporate standard deviation (STD) filtering and entropy gating mechanisms
during reinforcement learning. These techniques suppress unstable updates and
reduce variance in policy optimization. We evaluate OmniQuality-R on three key
IQA tasks: aesthetic quality assessment, technical quality evaluation, and
text-image alignment.

TL;DR: This paper improves linear graph transformer attention mechanisms by addressing their rank and focus limitations, using a hybrid framework and a learnable log-power function. The approach enhances classification ability while maintaining scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing linear attention mechanisms in Graph Transformers are efficient but suffer from reduced expressiveness, resulting in poor node representation separability, which limits their classification performance.

Method: The authors propose a hybrid framework combining a gated local graph network branch to enhance rank and a learnable log-power function to reduce entropy in attention scores, improving focus and class separability.

Result: The proposed method achieves competitive results on homophilic and heterophilic graph benchmarks while maintaining the scalability benefits of linear attention mechanisms.

Conclusion: The study contributes a scalable and expressive improvement to linear attention mechanisms in Graph Transformers, enhancing their ability to process graph data for classification tasks.

Abstract: Linear attention mechanisms have emerged as efficient alternatives to full
self-attention in Graph Transformers, offering linear time complexity. However,
existing linear attention models often suffer from a significant drop in
expressiveness due to low-rank projection structures and overly uniform
attention distributions. We theoretically prove that these properties reduce
the class separability of node representations, limiting the model's
classification ability. To address this, we propose a novel hybrid framework
that enhances both the rank and focus of attention. Specifically, we enhance
linear attention by attaching a gated local graph network branch to the value
matrix, thereby increasing the rank of the resulting attention map.
Furthermore, to alleviate the excessive smoothing effect inherent in linear
attention, we introduce a learnable log-power function into the attention
scores to reduce entropy and sharpen focus. We theoretically show that this
function decreases entropy in the attention distribution, enhancing the
separability of learned embeddings. Extensive experiments on both homophilic
and heterophilic graph benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves
competitive performance while preserving the scalability of linear attention.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of generating temporally coherent videos with accurate control of fine-grained motion like lip, head, and eye movements.

Method: The proposed method, DEMO, utilizes a motion auto-encoder to create a structured latent space and incorporates flow-matching with a transformer predictor for smooth motion trajectories conditioned on audio.

Result: The DEMO framework outperforms existing methods in metrics such as video realism, lip-audio synchronization, and motion quality across varied benchmarks.

Conclusion: Disentangling motion factors and leveraging flow-based modeling significantly improves controllable and realistic talking-head video synthesis.

Abstract: Audio-driven talking-head generation has advanced rapidly with
diffusion-based generative models, yet producing temporally coherent videos
with fine-grained motion control remains challenging. We propose DEMO, a
flow-matching generative framework for audio-driven talking-portrait video
synthesis that delivers disentangled, high-fidelity control of lip motion, head
pose, and eye gaze. The core contribution is a motion auto-encoder that builds
a structured latent space in which motion factors are independently represented
and approximately orthogonalized. On this disentangled motion space, we apply
optimal-transport-based flow matching with a transformer predictor to generate
temporally smooth motion trajectories conditioned on audio. Extensive
experiments across multiple benchmarks show that DEMO outperforms prior methods
in video realism, lip-audio synchronization, and motion fidelity. These results
demonstrate that combining fine-grained motion disentanglement with flow-based
generative modeling provides a powerful new paradigm for controllable
talking-head video synthesis.

### [345] [A Machine Learning Perspective on Automated Driving Corner Cases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10653)
*Sebastian Schmidt,Julius Körner,Stephan Günnemann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework for recognizing corner cases in high-stakes applications like autonomous driving by using a machine learning approach based on data distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of traditional corner case classification methods that lack scalability and neglect generalization to training data in critical autonomous systems.

Method: Proposed a framework that uses underlying data distribution for effective corner case detection and extends existing benchmarks and datasets to enhance evaluation.

Result: The approach unified corner case taxonomies, displayed strong performance on detection tasks, and facilitated analysis of combined corner cases through augmented datasets.

Conclusion: The framework establishes a principled and scalable definition of corner case recognition without requiring manual specification, offering significant improvements for autonomous perception systems.

Abstract: For high-stakes applications, like autonomous driving, a safe operation is
necessary to prevent harm, accidents, and failures. Traditionally, difficult
scenarios have been categorized into corner cases and addressed individually.
However, this example-based categorization is not scalable and lacks a data
coverage perspective, neglecting the generalization to training data of machine
learning models. In our work, we propose a novel machine learning approach that
takes the underlying data distribution into account. Based on our novel
perspective, we present a framework for effective corner case recognition for
perception on individual samples. In our evaluation, we show that our approach
(i) unifies existing scenario-based corner case taxonomies under a
distributional perspective, (ii) achieves strong performance on corner case
detection tasks across standard benchmarks for which we extend established
out-of-distribution detection benchmarks, and (iii) enables analysis of
combined corner cases via a newly introduced fog-augmented Lost & Found
dataset. These results provide a principled basis for corner case recognition,
underlining our manual specification-free definition.

*Hao Shan,Ruikai Li,Han Jiang,Yizhe Fan,Ziyang Yan,Bohan Li,Xiaoshuai Hao,Hao Zhao,Zhiyong Cui,Yilong Ren,Haiyang Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new benchmark for evaluating the temporal stability of online high-definition (HD) mapping models in autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing online HD mapping models focus on improving individual frame accuracy, neglecting the temporal stability essential for reliable autonomous navigation.

Method: A multi-dimensional stability evaluation framework is developed, incorporating metrics for Presence, Localization, and Shape Stability, integrated into a unified mAS score.

Result: Experiments on 42 models reveal that mapping accuracy (mAP) and stability (mAS) are independent performance dimensions, with key model design choices influencing both.

Conclusion: Temporal stability should be treated as a core evaluation metric for HD mapping models, alongside conventional accuracy metrics, to foster advancements in autonomous driving reliability.

Abstract: As one of the fundamental modules in autonomous driving, online
high-definition (HD) maps have attracted significant attention due to their
cost-effectiveness and real-time capabilities. Since vehicles always cruise in
highly dynamic environments, spatial displacement of onboard sensors inevitably
causes shifts in real-time HD mapping results, and such instability poses
fundamental challenges for downstream tasks. However, existing online map
construction models tend to prioritize improving each frame's mapping accuracy,
while the mapping stability has not yet been systematically studied. To fill
this gap, this paper presents the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
the temporal stability of online HD mapping models. We propose a
multi-dimensional stability evaluation framework with novel metrics for
Presence, Localization, and Shape Stability, integrated into a unified mean
Average Stability (mAS) score. Extensive experiments on 42 models and variants
show that accuracy (mAP) and stability (mAS) represent largely independent
performance dimensions. We further analyze the impact of key model design
choices on both criteria, identifying architectural and training factors that
contribute to high accuracy, high stability, or both. To encourage broader
focus on stability, we will release a public benchmark. Our work highlights the
importance of treating temporal stability as a core evaluation criterion
alongside accuracy, advancing the development of more reliable autonomous
driving systems. The benchmark toolkit, code, and models will be available at

*Gaojian Wang,Feng Lin,Tong Wu,Zhisheng Yan,Kui Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces FS-VFM, a self-supervised learning framework for robust facial representations, combining masked image modeling and instance discrimination with tailored strategies to improve face security tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop robust, transferable facial representations that generalize across various face security tasks using abundant unlabeled real face data.

Method: The FS-VFM framework uses masked image modeling (MIM) and instance discrimination (ID) with customized facial masking strategies (e.g., CRFR-P masking) and self-distillation to encode local and global facial patterns. Additionally, it employs FS-Adapter for efficient transfer learning.

Result: FS-VFM demonstrated superior generalization on 11 public face security benchmarks across tasks like deepfake detection and anti-spoofing. It outperformed state-of-the-art methods across different model scales.

Conclusion: FS-VFM provides a robust and efficient solution for face security tasks by leveraging self-supervised pretraining and transferable vision transformers, achieving high performance and efficiency.

Abstract: With abundant, unlabeled real faces, how can we learn robust and transferable
facial representations to boost generalization across various face security
tasks? We make the first attempt and propose FS-VFM, a scalable self-supervised
pre-training framework, to learn fundamental representations of real face
images. We introduce three learning objectives, namely 3C, that synergize
masked image modeling (MIM) and instance discrimination (ID), empowering FS-VFM
to encode both local patterns and global semantics of real faces. Specifically,
we formulate various facial masking strategies for MIM and devise a simple yet
effective CRFR-P masking, which explicitly prompts the model to pursue
meaningful intra-region Consistency and challenging inter-region Coherency. We
present a reliable self-distillation mechanism that seamlessly couples MIM with
ID to establish underlying local-to-global Correspondence. After pre-training,
vanilla vision transformers (ViTs) serve as universal Vision Foundation Models
for downstream Face Security tasks: cross-dataset deepfake detection,
cross-domain face anti-spoofing, and unseen diffusion facial forensics. To
efficiently transfer the pre-trained FS-VFM, we further propose FS-Adapter, a
lightweight plug-and-play bottleneck atop the frozen backbone with a novel
real-anchor contrastive objective. Extensive experiments on 11 public
benchmarks demonstrate that our FS-VFM consistently generalizes better than
diverse VFMs, spanning natural and facial domains, fully, weakly, and
self-supervised paradigms, small, base, and large ViT scales, and even
outperforms SOTA task-specific methods, while FS-Adapter offers an excellent
efficiency-performance trade-off. The code and models are available on

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes adapting pre-trained Text-to-Video (T2V) models to predict viewpoints from 4D scenes using a two-stage process, demonstrating its superiority and potential for real-world 4D interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring whether video generation models can be adapted for viewpoint planning in 4D scenes by leveraging their ability to simulate natural and dynamic viewpoints.

Method: A two-stage approach: (1) Inject a viewpoint-agnostic 4D scene representation into a T2V model to embed visualized viewpoints in generated videos, and (2) introduce a camera extrinsic denoising branch to extract viewpoints using hybrid conditions.

Result: The proposed method outperformed existing approaches and ablation studies confirmed the effectiveness of key technical components.

Conclusion: The research showcases T2V models' potential for 4D interactions, advancing viewpoint prediction technology and reinforcing the utility of video generation models in complex scene representation.

Abstract: Recent Text-to-Video (T2V) models have demonstrated powerful capability in
visual simulation of real-world geometry and physical laws, indicating its
potential as implicit world models. Inspired by this, we explore the
feasibility of leveraging the video generation prior for viewpoint planning
from given 4D scenes, since videos internally accompany dynamic scenes with
natural viewpoints. To this end, we propose a two-stage paradigm to adapt
pre-trained T2V models for viewpoint prediction, in a compatible manner. First,
we inject the 4D scene representation into the pre-trained T2V model via an
adaptive learning branch, where the 4D scene is viewpoint-agnostic and the
conditional generated video embeds the viewpoints visually. Then, we formulate
viewpoint extraction as a hybrid-condition guided camera extrinsic denoising
process. Specifically, a camera extrinsic diffusion branch is further
introduced onto the pre-trained T2V model, by taking the generated video and 4D
scene as input. Experimental results show the superiority of our proposed
method over existing competitors, and ablation studies validate the
effectiveness of our key technical designs. To some extent, this work proves
the potential of video generation models toward 4D interaction in real world.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to bridge the gap between the success of ILFM in image-text tasks and the growing interest in applying these models to video-text learning tasks.

Method: The survey categorizes image-to-video transfer learning strategies into frozen features and modified features, and systematically analyzes their applications to various video-text learning tasks. It also conducts experimental analysis to assess their performances.

Result: The paper provides an in-depth analysis of the efficacy of different transfer learning paradigms and highlights their applicability across diverse video-text tasks.

Conclusion: The work establishes a structured roadmap for advancing video-text learning using ILFM, identifies challenges, and highlights opportunities for future research.

Abstract: Image-Language Foundation Models (ILFM) have demonstrated remarkable success
in image-text understanding/generation tasks, providing transferable multimodal
representations that generalize across diverse downstream image-based tasks.
The advancement of video-text research has spurred growing interest in
extending image-based models to the video domain. This paradigm, known as
image-to-video transfer learning, succeeds in alleviating the substantial data
and computational requirements associated with training video-language
foundation models from scratch for video-text learning. This survey provides
the first comprehensive review of this emerging field, which begins by
summarizing the widely used ILFM and their capabilities. We then systematically
classify existing image-to-video transfer learning strategies into two
categories: frozen features and modified features, depending on whether the
original representations from ILFM are preserved or undergo modifications.
Building upon the task-specific nature of image-to-video transfer, this survey
methodically elaborates these strategies and details their applications across
a spectrum of video-text learning tasks, ranging from fine-grained (e.g.,
spatio-temporal video grounding) to coarse-grained (e.g., video question
answering). We further present a detailed experimental analysis to investigate
the efficacy of different image-to-video transfer learning paradigms on a range
of downstream video understanding tasks. Finally, we identify prevailing
challenges and highlight promising directions for future research. By offering
a comprehensive and structured overview, this survey aims to establish a
structured roadmap for advancing video-text learning based on existing ILFM,
and to inspire future research directions in this rapidly evolving domain.

### [350] [MSM-Seg: A Modality-and-Slice Memory Framework with Category-Agnostic Prompting for Multi-Modal Brain Tumor Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10679)
*Yuxiang Luo,Qing Xu,Hai Huang,Yuqi Ouyang,Zhen Chen,Wenting Duan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents MSM-Seg, a framework for multi-modal brain tumor segmentation combining cross-modal and inter-slice information. It introduces innovative memory and prompt encoding techniques to enhance accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current segmentation methods overly rely on category-specific prompts and fail to effectively utilize cross-modal and inter-slice relationships, limiting their usability and performance in clinical scenarios.

Method: MSM-Seg incorporates a dual-memory paradigm with three key components: a modality-and-slice memory attention module for relationship modeling, a multi-scale category-agnostic prompt encoder for tumor guidance, and a modality-adaptive fusion decoder for efficient use of multi-modal information.

Result: MSM-Seg achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in segmenting metastases and glioma tumors on various MRI datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed MSM-Seg enhances segmentation in multi-modal MRI scans by efficiently capturing cross-modal and inter-slice relationships and simplifying clinician workflows through category-agnostic prompts.

Abstract: Multi-modal brain tumor segmentation is critical for clinical diagnosis, and
it requires accurate identification of distinct internal anatomical subregions.
While the recent prompt-based segmentation paradigms enable interactive
experiences for clinicians, existing methods ignore cross-modal correlations
and rely on labor-intensive category-specific prompts, limiting their
applicability in real-world scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a
MSM-Seg framework for multi-modal brain tumor segmentation. The MSM-Seg
introduces a novel dual-memory segmentation paradigm that synergistically
integrates multi-modal and inter-slice information with the efficient
category-agnostic prompt for brain tumor understanding. To this end, we first
devise a modality-and-slice memory attention (MSMA) to exploit the cross-modal
and inter-slice relationships among the input scans. Then, we propose a
multi-scale category-agnostic prompt encoder (MCP-Encoder) to provide tumor
region guidance for decoding. Moreover, we devise a modality-adaptive fusion
decoder (MF-Decoder) that leverages the complementary decoding information
across different modalities to improve segmentation accuracy. Extensive
experiments on different MRI datasets demonstrate that our MSM-Seg framework
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in multi-modal metastases and glioma tumor
segmentation. The code is available at https://github.com/xq141839/MSM-Seg.

*Xinyu Yang,Zheheng Jiang,Feixiang Zhou,Yihang Zhu,Na Lv,Nan Xing,Huiyu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the State-Specific Model (SSM), aimed at improving action detection and anticipation by addressing video redundancy and incorporating agent intention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address issues such as video redundancy, noise in untrimmed videos, and neglect of agent intention in action understanding.

Method: Introduces three modules: Critical State-Based Memory Compression to reduce redundancy, Action Pattern Learning for modeling dynamics, and Cross-Temporal Interaction to link intention with past/current information.

Result: Experimental validation on multiple benchmark datasets shows superior performance compared to existing methods in action detection and anticipation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances understanding of action dynamics and intentions, providing promising avenues for future research in action understanding.

Abstract: Action understanding, encompassing action detection and anticipation, plays a
crucial role in numerous practical applications. However, untrimmed videos are
often characterized by substantial redundant information and noise. Moreover,
in modeling action understanding, the influence of the agent's intention on the
action is often overlooked. Motivated by these issues, we propose a novel
framework called the State-Specific Model (SSM), designed to unify and enhance
both action detection and anticipation tasks. In the proposed framework, the
Critical State-Based Memory Compression module compresses frame sequences into
critical states, reducing information redundancy. The Action Pattern Learning
module constructs a state-transition graph with multi-dimensional edges to
model action dynamics in complex scenarios, on the basis of which potential
future cues can be generated to represent intention. Furthermore, our
Cross-Temporal Interaction module models the mutual influence between
intentions and past as well as current information through cross-temporal
interactions, thereby refining present and future features and ultimately
realizing simultaneous action detection and anticipation. Extensive experiments
on multiple benchmark datasets -- including EPIC-Kitchens-100, THUMOS'14,
TVSeries, and the introduced Parkinson's Disease Mouse Behaviour (PDMB) dataset
-- demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed framework compared to
other state-of-the-art approaches. These results highlight the importance of
action dynamics learning and cross-temporal interactions, laying a foundation
for future action understanding research.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified framework for generating high-quality dynamic Gaussian Splatting from monocular videos that are defocused or motion-blurred, overcoming limitations of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of handling both defocus blur and motion blur simultaneously in monocular video processing, leveraging their differences in formation processes.

Method: A blur prediction network estimates per-pixel reliable blur kernels using scene and camera information, combined with a dynamic Gaussian densification strategy for handling incomplete regions and unseen views.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art techniques for photorealistic novel view synthesis from blurred monocular videos.

Conclusion: The framework successfully integrates blur kernel estimation and Gaussian densification to improve synthesis quality, with plans to release code and trained models for wider use.

Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework that allows high-quality dynamic
Gaussian Splatting from both defocused and motion-blurred monocular videos. Due
to the significant difference between the formation processes of defocus blur
and motion blur, existing methods are tailored for either one of them, lacking
the ability to simultaneously deal with both of them. Although the two can be
jointly modeled as blur kernel-based convolution, the inherent difficulty in
estimating accurate blur kernels greatly limits the progress in this direction.
In this work, we go a step further towards this direction. Particularly, we
propose to estimate per-pixel reliable blur kernels using a blur prediction
network that exploits blur-related scene and camera information and is subject
to a blur-aware sparsity constraint. Besides, we introduce a dynamic Gaussian
densification strategy to mitigate the lack of Gaussians for incomplete
regions, and boost the performance of novel view synthesis by incorporating
unseen view information to constrain scene optimization. Extensive experiments
show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in generating
photorealistic novel view synthesis from defocused and motion-blurred monocular
videos. Our code and trained model will be made publicly available.

geometric prediction tasks. Unlike existing methods constrained to image-only
inputs or customized for a specific task, our framework flexibly integrates
diverse geometric priors, including camera poses, intrinsics, and depth maps,
while simultaneously generating multiple 3D representations: dense point
clouds, multi-view depth maps, camera parameters, surface normals, and 3D
Gaussians. This elegant and unified architecture leverages available prior
information to resolve structural ambiguities and delivers geometrically
consistent 3D outputs in a single forward pass. WorldMirror achieves
state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks from camera, point map,
depth, and surface normal estimation to novel view synthesis, while maintaining
the efficiency of feed-forward inference. Code and models will be publicly

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance VR/AR systems by enabling intelligent adaptation to users through accurate understanding of human intentions and predictive modeling of their behaviors.

Method: The method involves developing a hierarchical framework using a dynamic Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to model human intentions and predict behaviors based on historical dynamics and scene context.

Result: The framework demonstrates superior predictive performance on real-world benchmarks and live VR environments, incorporating human-environment relationships to improve behavior forecasts.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully enhances VR/AR systems by enabling proactive adaptation to user behaviors, paving the way for personalized and responsive virtual environments.

Abstract: Virtual and augmented reality systems increasingly demand intelligent
adaptation to user behaviors for enhanced interaction experiences. Achieving
this requires accurately understanding human intentions and predicting future
situated behaviors - such as gaze direction and object interactions - which is
vital for creating responsive VR/AR environments and applications like
personalized assistants. However, accurate behavioral prediction demands
modeling the underlying cognitive processes that drive human-environment
interactions. In this work, we introduce a hierarchical, intention-aware
framework that models human intentions and predicts detailed situated behaviors
by leveraging cognitive mechanisms. Given historical human dynamics and the
observation of scene contexts, our framework first identifies potential
interaction targets and forecasts fine-grained future behaviors. We propose a
dynamic Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to effectively capture
human-environment relationships. Extensive experiments on challenging
real-world benchmarks and live VR environment demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach, achieving superior performance across all metrics and enabling
practical applications for proactive VR systems that anticipate user behaviors

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Marine biodiversity monitoring often involves vast amounts of uneventful footage, making manual video inspection impractical. The paper seeks automated solutions via anomaly detection.

Method: Deep neural networks are applied to detect visual anomalies in underwater videos. The paper introduces the AURA dataset and evaluates four VAD models across different marine contexts.

Result: Current VAD models show considerable differences in performance based on variations in training data size and content defining 'normal' scenes. Robust frame selection and soft consensus labels are emphasized.

Conclusion: AURA offers a way forward to automate marine biodiversity monitoring through improved anomaly detection models and datasets, aiming at scalable and insightful scientific exploration.

Abstract: Underwater video monitoring is a promising strategy for assessing marine
biodiversity, but the vast volume of uneventful footage makes manual inspection
highly impractical. In this work, we explore the use of visual anomaly
detection (VAD) based on deep neural networks to automatically identify
interesting or anomalous events. We introduce AURA, the first multi-annotator
benchmark dataset for underwater VAD, and evaluate four VAD models across two
marine scenes. We demonstrate the importance of robust frame selection
strategies to extract meaningful video segments. Our comparison against
multiple annotators reveals that VAD performance of current models varies
dramatically and is highly sensitive to both the amount of training data and
the variability in visual content that defines "normal" scenes. Our results
highlight the value of soft and consensus labels and offer a practical approach
for supporting scientific exploration and scalable biodiversity monitoring.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a face similarity metric based on patch-level explanations, offering competitive verification performance while being more interpretable without post-hoc analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of improving interpretability in deep neural networks used in computer vision, particularly to ensure fidelity in their reasoning processes, without relying on questionable post-hoc methods.

Method: The authors develop a face similarity metric that breaks global similarity into patch-level scores, providing locally additive explanations. The method eliminates the need for post-hoc analysis by inherently designing an interpretable model.

Result: The proposed method achieves competitive face verification performance using small patches, and even surpasses state-of-the-art methods with larger patches.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully balances interpretability and performance, demonstrating that breaking global similarity into patch-level contributions is a viable strategy for designing inherently interpretable models.

Abstract: Understanding how deep neural networks make decisions is crucial for
analyzing their behavior and diagnosing failure cases. In computer vision, a
common approach to improve interpretability is to assign importance to
individual pixels using post-hoc methods. Although they are widely used to
explain black-box models, their fidelity to the model's actual reasoning is
uncertain due to the lack of reliable evaluation metrics. This limitation
motivates an alternative approach, which is to design models whose decision
processes are inherently interpretable. To this end, we propose a face
similarity metric that breaks down global similarity into contributions from
restricted receptive fields. Our method defines the similarity between two face
images as the sum of patch-level similarity scores, providing a locally
additive explanation without relying on post-hoc analysis. We show that the
proposed approach achieves competitive verification performance even with
patches as small as 28x28 within 112x112 face images, and surpasses
state-of-the-art methods when using 56x56 patches.

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel 2.5D graph-based framework for multi-label classification in 3D Chest CT scans, addressing challenges like long-range spatial dependencies and complexity for clinical deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the increasing demand for automated tools in medical imaging, particularly in multi-label classification of 3D Chest CT scans, which present significant challenges due to spatial complexities and abnormality variability.

Method: A 2.5D graph-based framework is proposed, where 3D CT volumes are represented as structured graphs using axial slice triplets as nodes, processed by spectral graph convolution to model inter-slice dependencies efficiently.

Result: The proposed method shows strong cross-dataset generalization, competitive performance against state-of-the-art visual encoders, and successful demonstrations in automated report generation and abdominal CT transfer tasks.

Conclusion: The framework provides an effective and generalizable solution for multi-label classification of 3D medical images, suggesting potential applications in broader healthcare contexts.

Abstract: With the growing volume of CT examinations, there is an increasing demand for
automated tools such as organ segmentation, abnormality detection, and report
generation to support radiologists in managing their clinical workload.
Multi-label classification of 3D Chest CT scans remains a critical yet
challenging problem due to the complex spatial relationships inherent in
volumetric data and the wide variability of abnormalities. Existing methods
based on 3D convolutional neural networks struggle to capture long-range
dependencies, while Vision Transformers often require extensive pre-training on
large-scale, domain-specific datasets to perform competitively. In this work,
we propose a 2.5D alternative by introducing a new graph-based framework that
represents 3D CT volumes as structured graphs, where axial slice triplets serve
as nodes processed through spectral graph convolution, enabling the model to
reason over inter-slice dependencies while maintaining complexity compatible
with clinical deployment. Our method, trained and evaluated on 3 datasets from
independent institutions, achieves strong cross-dataset generalization, and
shows competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art visual encoders. We
further conduct comprehensive ablation studies to evaluate the impact of
various aggregation strategies, edge-weighting schemes, and graph connectivity
patterns. Additionally, we demonstrate the broader applicability of our
approach through transfer experiments on automated radiology report generation
and abdominal CT data.\\ This work extends our previous contribution presented
at the MICCAI 2025 EMERGE Workshop.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DISC-GAN introduces a framework for underwater image synthesis, leveraging style-content disentanglement and cluster-specific training for enhanced realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges posed by optical phenomena like color attenuation and turbidity in underwater image synthesis.

Method: The approach involves K-means clustering for style-specific domain partitioning, separate encoders for style and content, AdaIN integration, and cluster-specific training.

Result: The framework achieves SSIM of 0.9012, PSNR of 32.5118 dB, and FID of 13.3728, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: DISC-GAN effectively models non-uniform underwater environments, offering improved photorealistic image synthesis suitable for various applications.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Disentangled Style-Content GAN
(DISC-GAN), which integrates style-content disentanglement with a
cluster-specific training strategy towards photorealistic underwater image
synthesis. The quality of synthetic underwater images is challenged by optical
due to phenomena such as color attenuation and turbidity. These phenomena are
represented by distinct stylistic variations across different waterbodies, such
as changes in tint and haze. While generative models are well-suited to capture
complex patterns, they often lack the ability to model the non-uniform
conditions of diverse underwater environments. To address these challenges, we
employ K-means clustering to partition a dataset into style-specific domains.
We use separate encoders to get latent spaces for style and content; we further
integrate these latent representations via Adaptive Instance Normalization
(AdaIN) and decode the result to produce the final synthetic image. The model
is trained independently on each style cluster to preserve domain-specific
characteristics. Our framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance,
obtaining a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.9012, an average Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 32.5118 dB, and a Frechet Inception Distance
(FID) of 13.3728.

*Rolandos Alexandros Potamias,Stathis Galanakis,Jiankang Deng,Athanasios Papaioannou,Stefanos Zafeiriou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces imHead, a novel implicit 3D morphable model (3DMM) for creating expressive, editable 3D head avatars, achieving superior performance and interpretability compared to prior approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3DMMs struggle to represent complex full-head shapes due to strict topology and linearity, limiting their ability to create expressive 3D avatars.

Method: imHead retains a compact identity space and introduces a region-specific latent representation to enable local edits, trained on a dataset of 4K identities for large-scale 3D head modeling.

Result: The proposed imHead model outperforms prior methods in representing diverse identities and expressions, while allowing interpretable and localized facial edits.

Conclusion: imHead provides a significant advancement in 3D head modeling, combining expressiveness, accuracy, and user-friendly local editability, showing potential for real-world applications.

Abstract: Over the last years, 3D morphable models (3DMMs) have emerged as a
state-of-the-art methodology for modeling and generating expressive 3D avatars.
However, given their reliance on a strict topology, along with their linear
nature, they struggle to represent complex full-head shapes. Following the
advent of deep implicit functions, we propose imHead, a novel implicit 3DMM
that not only models expressive 3D head avatars but also facilitates localized
editing of the facial features. Previous methods directly divided the latent
space into local components accompanied by an identity encoding to capture the
global shape variations, leading to expensive latent sizes. In contrast, we
retain a single compact identity space and introduce an intermediate
region-specific latent representation to enable local edits. To train imHead,
we curate a large-scale dataset of 4K distinct identities, making a
step-towards large scale 3D head modeling. Under a series of experiments we
demonstrate the expressive power of the proposed model to represent diverse
identities and expressions outperforming previous approaches. Additionally, the
proposed approach provides an interpretable solution for 3D face manipulation,
allowing the user to make localized edits.

*Aleksandra Melnikova,Petr Matula*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper expands on work from 2025 by describing a 3D time-lapse segmentation annotation dataset of migrating breast carcinoma cells and validating its accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation was to create high-quality, publicly available segmentation annotations, especially for time-consuming volumetric images, to advance image processing research.

Method: Three human annotators generated full 3D time-lapse segmentation annotations for sequences of breast carcinoma cells and compared these to automatic methods and established gold standards.

Result: The 3D annotations were consistent with tracking markers, had segmentation accuracy within inter-annotator variability margins, and better represented image complexity than automatically created annotations.

Conclusion: These annotations can serve as a valuable resource for cell segmentation tasks, as well as for analyzing the 3D shapes of dynamic biological objects.

Abstract: High-quality, publicly available segmentation annotations of image and video
datasets are critical for advancing the field of image processing. In
particular, annotations of volumetric images of a large number of targets are
time-consuming and challenging. In (Melnikova, A., & Matula, P., 2025), we
presented the first publicly available full 3D time-lapse segmentation
annotations of migrating cells with complex dynamic shapes. Concretely, three
distinct humans annotated two sequences of MDA231 human breast carcinoma cells
(Fluo-C3DL-MDA231) from the Cell Tracking Challenge (CTC).
  This paper aims to provide a comprehensive description of the dataset and
accompanying experiments that were not included in (Melnikova, A., & Matula,
P., 2025) due to limitations in publication space. Namely, we show that the
created annotations are consistent with the previously published tracking
markers provided by the CTC organizers and the segmentation accuracy measured
based on the 2D gold truth of CTC is within the inter-annotator variability
margins. We compared the created 3D annotations with automatically created
silver truth provided by CTC. We have found the proposed annotations better
represent the complexity of the input images. The presented annotations can be
used for testing and training cell segmentation, or analyzing 3D shapes of
highly dynamic objects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clouds hinder reliable analysis in critical satellite applications. The paper aims to improve cloud segmentation accuracy to overcome this challenge.

Method: The method utilizes MSCloudCAM, which integrates a Swin Transformer, multi-scale context modules (ASPP, PSP), and Cross-Attention for feature fusion. It also incorporates Efficient Channel Attention Block (ECAB) and Spatial Attention Module for refined feature representation.

Result: Comprehensive experiments show MSCloudCAM achieves state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy on CloudSEN12 and L8Biome datasets with efficient parameter and computation handling.

Conclusion: MSCloudCAM proves effective and practical for large-scale Earth observation tasks, offering advancements in accuracy and real-world applicability.

Abstract: Clouds remain a critical challenge in optical satellite imagery, hindering
reliable analysis for environmental monitoring, land cover mapping, and climate
research. To overcome this, we propose MSCloudCAM, a Cross-Attention with
Multi-Scale Context Network tailored for multispectral and multi-sensor cloud
segmentation. Our framework exploits the spectral richness of Sentinel-2
(CloudSEN12) and Landsat-8 (L8Biome) data to classify four semantic categories:
clear sky, thin cloud, thick cloud, and cloud shadow. MSCloudCAM combines a
Swin Transformer backbone for hierarchical feature extraction with multi-scale
context modules ASPP and PSP for enhanced scale-aware learning. A
Cross-Attention block enables effective multisensor and multispectral feature
fusion, while the integration of an Efficient Channel Attention Block (ECAB)
and a Spatial Attention Module adaptively refine feature representations.
Comprehensive experiments on CloudSEN12 and L8Biome demonstrate that MSCloudCAM
delivers state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy, surpassing leading baseline
architectures while maintaining competitive parameter efficiency and FLOPs.
These results underscore the model's effectiveness and practicality, making it
well-suited for large-scale Earth observation tasks and real-world
applications.

*Clemence Mottez,Louisa Fay,Maya Varma,Sophie Ostmeier,Curtis Langlotz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework to identify and mitigate biases in deep learning models for chest X-ray diagnosis, focusing on sex, age, and race disparities. The proposed approach improves fairness without compromising diagnostic performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the risk of perpetuating healthcare disparities due to varying performance of deep learning models across demographic groups in chest X-ray diagnostics.

Method: The study extends a CNN-XGBoost pipeline for multi-label classification, substitutes CNN's final layer with eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) classifiers, tests different backbone architectures (DenseNet-121, ResNet-50), and compares with other bias mitigation methods like adversarial training, reweighting, and data augmentation.

Result: Replacing the CNN's final layer with an XGBoost classifier enhances subgroup fairness and overall diagnostic accuracy. Combining this with active learning significantly reduces bias for all demographic subgroups in CheXpert and MIMIC datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is effective and computationally efficient in reducing demographic biases in clinical radiology models, providing a robust path for equitable deployment of deep learning systems.

Abstract: Deep learning models have shown promise in improving diagnostic accuracy from
chest X-rays, but they also risk perpetuating healthcare disparities when
performance varies across demographic groups. In this work, we present a
comprehensive bias detection and mitigation framework targeting sex, age, and
race-based disparities when performing diagnostic tasks with chest X-rays. We
extend a recent CNN-XGBoost pipeline to support multi-label classification and
evaluate its performance across four medical conditions. We show that replacing
the final layer of CNN with an eXtreme Gradient Boosting classifier improves
the fairness of the subgroup while maintaining or improving the overall
predictive performance. To validate its generalizability, we apply the method
to different backbones, namely DenseNet-121 and ResNet-50, and achieve
similarly strong performance and fairness outcomes, confirming its
model-agnostic design. We further compare this lightweight adapter training
method with traditional full-model training bias mitigation techniques,
including adversarial training, reweighting, data augmentation, and active
learning, and find that our approach offers competitive or superior bias
reduction at a fraction of the computational cost. Finally, we show that
combining eXtreme Gradient Boosting retraining with active learning yields the
largest reduction in bias across all demographic subgroups, both in and out of
distribution on the CheXpert and MIMIC datasets, establishing a practical and
effective path toward equitable deep learning deployment in clinical radiology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Transformer-based models for 3D Human Mesh Recovery are optimized using layer and token merging strategies, achieving faster processing with improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based models often require high computational resources due to redundant layers and tokens, motivating the need for efficient optimization.

Method: Proposed Error-Constrained Layer Merging (ECLM) and Mask-guided Token Merging (Mask-ToMe) to reduce redundancy, complemented by a diffusion-based decoder leveraging temporal context and motion capture priors.

Result: Achieved up to 2.3x speed-up in computational performance while marginally improving accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed strategies provide a practical balance between efficiency and model performance in 3D Human Mesh Recovery tasks.

Abstract: Recent transformer-based models for 3D Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) have
achieved strong performance but often suffer from high computational cost and
complexity due to deep transformer architectures and redundant tokens. In this
paper, we introduce two HMR-specific merging strategies: Error-Constrained
Layer Merging (ECLM) and Mask-guided Token Merging (Mask-ToMe). ECLM
selectively merges transformer layers that have minimal impact on the Mean Per
Joint Position Error (MPJPE), while Mask-ToMe focuses on merging background
tokens that contribute little to the final prediction. To further address the
potential performance drop caused by merging, we propose a diffusion-based
decoder that incorporates temporal context and leverages pose priors learned
from large-scale motion capture datasets. Experiments across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves up to 2.3x speed-up while
slightly improving performance over the baseline.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RareBoost3D, a synthetic point cloud dataset, and the CSC loss method to address the long-tail problem in LiDAR-based perception, improving segmentation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the long-tail issue in real-world point cloud datasets, which hinders the development of LiDAR-based perception technologies.

Method: Introduce RareBoost3D, a synthetic dataset with enriched rare class instances, combined with a proposed cross-domain semantic alignment method (CSC loss) for feature alignment across domains.

Result: Experimental results show that using RareBoost3D and CSC loss improves the segmentation performance of LiDAR-based models on real-world data.

Conclusion: Enriching rare class instances with a synthetic dataset and applying semantic alignment techniques can effectively tackle the long-tail problem and boost model performance in LiDAR-based perception tasks.

Abstract: Real-world point cloud datasets have made significant contributions to the
development of LiDAR-based perception technologies, such as object segmentation
for autonomous driving. However, due to the limited number of instances in some
rare classes, the long-tail problem remains a major challenge in existing
datasets. To address this issue, we introduce a novel, synthetic point cloud
dataset named RareBoost3D, which complements existing real-world datasets by
providing significantly more instances for object classes that are rare in
real-world datasets. To effectively leverage both synthetic and real-world
data, we further propose a cross-domain semantic alignment method named CSC
loss that aligns feature representations of the same class across different
domains. Experimental results demonstrate that this alignment significantly
enhances the performance of LiDAR point cloud segmentation models over
real-world data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces EarthWhere, a benchmark to evaluate vision-language models (VLMs) on open-world image-grounded geolocation tasks, offering insights into both their strengths and limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The researchers aim to address the gap in comprehensively evaluating how well VLMs perform on challenging, globally-distributed image geolocation tasks relevant to real-life demands.

Method: They created EarthWhere, a benchmark with two scales: country-level (WhereCountry) and street-level (WhereStreet) geolocation tasks. It utilizes various metrics to evaluate location accuracy and scoring reasoning chains via visual clues and a Shapley-reweighted thinking score.

Result: Out of 13 state-of-the-art VLMs evaluated, Gemini-2.5-Pro achieved the highest average accuracy of 56.32%, while the strongest open-weight model, GLM-4.5V, reached 34.71%. Findings also showed regional biases and limitations in reasoning when visual clues were scarce.

Conclusion: The evaluation highlights both the promise of VLMs in geolocation tasks and their challenges, such as tackling regional biases and achieving reliable fine-grained localization, underscoring the persistent complexities for improvement in this area.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced rapidly, yet their capacity for
image-grounded geolocation in open-world conditions, a task that is challenging
and of demand in real life, has not been comprehensively evaluated. We present
EarthWhere, a comprehensive benchmark for VLM image geolocation that evaluates
visual recognition, step-by-step reasoning, and evidence use. EarthWhere
comprises 810 globally distributed images across two complementary geolocation
scales: WhereCountry (i.e., 500 multiple-choice question-answering, with
country-level answer and panoramas) and WhereStreet (i.e., 310 fine-grained
street-level identification tasks requiring multi-step reasoning with optional
web search). For evaluation, we adopt the final-prediction metrics: location
accuracies within k km (Acc@k) for coordinates and hierarchical path scores for
textual localization. Beyond this, we propose to explicitly score intermediate
reasoning chains using human-verified key visual clues and a Shapley-reweighted
thinking score that attributes credit to each clue's marginal contribution. We
benchmark 13 state-of-the-art VLMs with web searching tools on our EarthWhere
and report different types of final answer accuracies as well as the calibrated
model thinking scores. Overall, Gemini-2.5-Pro achieves the best average
accuracy at 56.32%, while the strongest open-weight model, GLM-4.5V, reaches
34.71%. We reveal that web search and reasoning do not guarantee improved
performance when visual clues are limited, and models exhibit regional biases,
achieving up to 42.7% higher scores in certain areas than others. These
findings highlight not only the promise but also the persistent challenges of
models to mitigate bias and achieve robust, fine-grained localization. We
open-source our benchmark at https://github.com/UCSC-VLAA/EarthWhere.

*Junwon You,Dasol Kang,Jae-Hun Jung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ToMCLIP introduces a topology-aware framework improving zero-shot and multilingual retrieval performance in vision-language models using persistent homology for embedding alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a bias in cross-modal alignment toward English in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) due to limited multilingual data, alongside a neglect of the global geometry of shared embedding space.

Method: ToMCLIP introduces topology-preserving constraints via persistent homology and approximates persistence diagrams with error-bounded graph sparsification, defining a novel topological alignment loss.

Result: Enhanced structural coherence of multilingual representations, improved zero-shot accuracy on CIFAR-100, and stronger multilingual retrieval performance on xFlickr&CO.

Conclusion: The framework not only improves multilingual multimodal alignment in VLMs but also offers a generalizable method for applying topological alignment in representation learning.

Abstract: Contrastive Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong zero-shot
capabilities. However, their cross-modal alignment remains biased toward
English due to limited multilingual multimodal data. Recent multilingual
extensions have alleviated this gap but enforce instance-level alignment while
neglecting the global geometry of the shared embedding space. We address this
problem by introducing ToMCLIP (Topological Alignment for Multilingual CLIP), a
topology-aware framework aligning embedding spaces with topology-preserving
constraints. The proposed method applies persistent homology to define a
topological alignment loss and approximates persistence diagram with
theoretical error bounds using graph sparsification strategy. This work
validates the proposed approach, showing enhanced structural coherence of
multilingual representations, higher zero-shot accuracy on the CIFAR-100, and
stronger multilingual retrieval performance on the xFlickr&CO. Beyond VLMs, the
proposed approach provides a general method for incorporating topological
alignment into representation learning.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SceneTextStylizer, a diffusion-based framework enabling flexible and high-fidelity style transfer for scene text images, addressing the limitations of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for scene text editing struggle with flexible and localized style transformation, and are limited to basic content replacement or simplistic styles.

Method: The framework leverages diffusion model inversion, self-attention for feature injection, a distance-based mask for spatial control, and a Fourier-based style enhancement module for improved visual quality.

Result: SceneTextStylizer delivers superior performance in scene text style transfer compared to state-of-the-art methods, with enhanced visual fidelity and text readability.

Conclusion: SceneTextStylizer effectively solves the challenge of localized and flexible style transfer for scene text, opening doors for more visually-rich text editing in images.

Abstract: With the rapid development of diffusion models, style transfer has made
remarkable progress. However, flexible and localized style editing for scene
text remains an unsolved challenge. Although existing scene text editing
methods have achieved text region editing, they are typically limited to
content replacement and simple styles, which lack the ability of free-style
transfer. In this paper, we introduce SceneTextStylizer, a novel training-free
diffusion-based framework for flexible and high-fidelity style transfer of text
in scene images. Unlike prior approaches that either perform global style
transfer or focus solely on textual content modification, our method enables
prompt-guided style transformation specifically for text regions, while
preserving both text readability and stylistic consistency. To achieve this, we
design a feature injection module that leverages diffusion model inversion and
self-attention to transfer style features effectively. Additionally, a region
control mechanism is introduced by applying a distance-based changing mask at
each denoising step, enabling precise spatial control. To further enhance
visual quality, we incorporate a style enhancement module based on the Fourier
transform to reinforce stylistic richness. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method achieves superior performance in scene text style
transformation, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods in both visual
fidelity and text preservation.

Motivation: Existing makeup simulation technology struggles with issues like training instability and limited customization options.

Method: The paper presents a novel method leveraging diffusion models, employing DDIM inversion for precise image editing and facial identity preservation.

Result: DreamMakeup delivers improved customization, better color matching, enhanced identity preservation, and compatibility with textual descriptions at lower computational costs.

Conclusion: DreamMakeup outperforms GAN and other diffusion-based approaches, offering superior virtual makeup simulation with efficient computation.

Abstract: The exponential growth of the global makeup market has paralleled
advancements in virtual makeup simulation technology. Despite the progress led
by GANs, their application still encounters significant challenges, including
training instability and limited customization capabilities. Addressing these
challenges, we introduce DreamMakup - a novel training-free Diffusion model
based Makeup Customization method, leveraging the inherent advantages of
diffusion models for superior controllability and precise real-image editing.
DreamMakeup employs early-stopped DDIM inversion to preserve the facial
structure and identity while enabling extensive customization through various
conditioning inputs such as reference images, specific RGB colors, and textual
descriptions. Our model demonstrates notable improvements over existing
GAN-based and recent diffusion-based frameworks - improved customization,

TL;DR: The paper introduces FG-CLIP 2, a bilingual model enhancing fine-grained vision-language alignment in English and Chinese, surpassing prior methods across numerous tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models struggle with fine-grained alignment of visual and linguistic data, especially for non-English languages, impeding bilingual and detailed multimodal understanding.

Method: FG-CLIP 2 employs fine-grained supervision (region-text matching, long-caption modeling), discriminative objectives, and a Textual Intra-modal Contrastive (TIC) loss. It is trained on curated bilingual datasets and evaluated against a new benchmark.

Result: FG-CLIP 2 demonstrates state-of-the-art bilingual performance on multimodal tasks across 29 datasets, excelling in both English and Chinese.

Conclusion: The proposed FG-CLIP 2 significantly advances fine-grained bilingual vision-language understanding and provides resources for future research.

Abstract: Fine-grained vision-language understanding requires precise alignment between
visual content and linguistic descriptions, a capability that remains limited
in current models, particularly in non-English settings. While models like CLIP
perform well on global alignment, they often struggle to capture fine-grained
details in object attributes, spatial relations, and linguistic expressions,
with limited support for bilingual comprehension. To address these challenges,
we introduce FG-CLIP 2, a bilingual vision-language model designed to advance
fine-grained alignment for both English and Chinese. Our approach leverages
rich fine-grained supervision, including region-text matching and long-caption
modeling, alongside multiple discriminative objectives. We further introduce
the Textual Intra-modal Contrastive (TIC) loss to better distinguish
semantically similar captions. Trained on a carefully curated mixture of
large-scale English and Chinese data, FG-CLIP 2 achieves powerful bilingual
performance. To enable rigorous evaluation, we present a new benchmark for
Chinese multimodal understanding, featuring long-caption retrieval and bounding
box classification. Extensive experiments on 29 datasets across 8 tasks show
that FG-CLIP 2 outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results
in both languages. We release the model, code, and benchmark to facilitate
future research on bilingual fine-grained alignment.

*Namhoon Kim,Sara Fridovich-Keil*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a calibration-free method to quantify uncertainty for generative models handling inverse problems, emphasizing its effectiveness in detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models risk producing inaccurate reconstructions when test data is outside the training distribution, creating a need for uncertainty indicators that are reliable, calibration-free, and sensitive to distribution shifts.

Method: The proposed method uses stability under random measurement variations to quantify uncertainty in reconstructions, assuming higher instability for OOD data. It operates without retraining or knowledge of the training distribution.

Result: Experimental validation on tomographic reconstruction of MNIST digits shows that the method reliably detects distribution shifts. Instabilities correlate with higher reconstruction errors for OOD inputs.

Conclusion: The method provides an efficient OOD detection mechanism, supporting safe generative model deployment for inverse problems by pairing generative priors with automated instability-based safeguards.

Abstract: Generative models have shown strong potential as data-driven priors for
solving inverse problems such as reconstructing medical images from
undersampled measurements. While these priors improve reconstruction quality
with fewer measurements, they risk hallucinating features when test images lie
outside the training distribution. Existing uncertainty quantification methods
in this setting (i) require an in-distribution calibration dataset, which may
not be available, (ii) provide heuristic rather than statistical estimates, or
(iii) quantify uncertainty from model capacity or limited measurements rather
than distribution shift. We propose an instance-level, calibration-free
uncertainty indicator that is sensitive to distribution shift, requires no
knowledge of the training distribution, and incurs no retraining cost. Our key
hypothesis is that reconstructions of in-distribution images remain stable
under random measurement variations, while reconstructions of
out-of-distribution (OOD) images exhibit greater instability. We use this
stability as a proxy for detecting distribution shift. Our proposed OOD
indicator is efficiently computable for any computational imaging inverse
problem; we demonstrate it on tomographic reconstruction of MNIST digits, where
a learned proximal network trained only on digit "0" is evaluated on all ten
digits. Reconstructions of OOD digits show higher variability and
correspondingly higher reconstruction error, validating this indicator. These
results suggest a deployment strategy that pairs generative priors with
lightweight guardrails, enabling aggressive measurement reduction for
in-distribution cases while automatically warning when priors are applied out
of distribution.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces IUT-Plug to tackle challenges in logic, object identity, and style preservation in vision language models (VLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs struggle with context drift, limiting their performance in complex multimodal tasks.

Method: The proposed IUT-Plug extracts hierarchical symbolic structures from visual scenes and ensures cross-modal consistency via a narrative-flow and synthesis mechanism.

Result: Experiments show improved accuracy and reduced context drift across multimodal QA tasks using a novel benchmark.

Conclusion: IUT-Plug enhances logic and entity identity preservation in VLMs, demonstrating improved generalization for multimodal scenarios.

Abstract: Existing vision language models (VLMs), including GPT-4 and DALL-E, often
struggle to preserve logic, object identity, and style in multimodal image-text
generation. This limitation significantly hinders the generalization capability
of VLMs in complex image-text input-output scenarios. To address this issue, we
propose IUT-Plug, a module grounded in an Image Understanding Tree (IUT), which
enhances existing interleaved VLMs through explicit structured reasoning,
thereby mitigating context drift in logic, entity identity, and style. The
proposed framework operates in two stages. (1) A dynamic IUT-Plug extraction
module parses visual scenes into hierarchical symbolic structures. (2) A
coordinated narrative-flow and image synthesis mechanism ensures cross-modal
consistency. To evaluate our approach, we construct a novel benchmark based on
3,000 real human-generated question-answer pairs over fine-tuned large models,
introducing a dynamic evaluation protocol for quantifying context drift in
interleaved VLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that IUT-Plug not only
improves accuracy on established benchmarks but also effectively alleviates the
three critical forms of context drift across diverse multimodal question
answering (QA) scenarios.

Motivation: LVLMs perform well on visual reasoning tasks but struggle with out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios and producing explainable rationales, which limits their reliability.

Method: Chart-RVR combines Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with verifiable rewards. It employs three rewards to optimize chart reasoning: chart-type classification, faithful table reconstruction, and process conformity.

Result: Chart-RVR consistently outperforms supervised fine-tuning on various datasets, effectively bridging the OOD performance gap and improving rationale fidelity, achieving state-of-the-art results on six benchmarks.

Conclusion: Chart-RVR enhances accuracy and interpretability, showcasing how verifiable rewards and GRPO can create reliable, interpretable LVLMs for chart reasoning tasks.

Abstract: The capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have reached
state-of-the-art on many visual reasoning tasks, including chart reasoning, yet
they still falter on out-of-distribution (OOD) data, and degrade further when
asked to produce their chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales, limiting
explainability. We present Chart-RVR, a general framework that fine-tunes LVLMs
to be more robust and explainable for chart reasoning by coupling Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with automatically verifiable rewards. Our
framework comprises of three rewards that maximize: (i) correct chart-type
classification, (ii) faithful chart table reconstruction, and (iii) process
conformity. Applied to 3-billion-parameter LVLMs, Chart-RVR consistently
outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution datasets, closing the OOD performance gap while improving
rationale fidelity. The resulting models, the Chart-RVR-3B series, achieve
state-of-the-art results on six chart-reasoning benchmarks spanning in-domain
and OOD settings, surpassing all existing models of comparable size. Beyond
accuracy, Chart-RVR yields more interpretable CoT rationales, strengthening
trust and reliability - showcasing the power of verifiable rewards with GRPO
for training reliable, interpretable chart-reasoning models.

### [374] [Mixup Helps Understanding Multimodal Video Better](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10986)
*Xiaoyu Ma,Ding Ding,Hao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses overfitting in multimodal video understanding by proposing techniques to balance contributions from strong and weak modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome the challenge in multimodal video models where stronger modalities dominate learning, reducing the contribution of weaker ones.

Method: The authors introduce Multimodal Mixup (MM) to create virtual feature-label pairs for better generalization and Balanced Multimodal Mixup (B-MM), which adjusts mix ratios dynamically to balance modalities.

Result: Experiments across multiple datasets show that the proposed methods enhance generalization and robustness in multimodal learning.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that both MM and B-MM significantly improve the performance of multimodal models, addressing overfitting and modality imbalance effectively.

Abstract: Multimodal video understanding plays a crucial role in tasks such as action
recognition and emotion classification by combining information from different
modalities. However, multimodal models are prone to overfitting strong
modalities, which can dominate learning and suppress the contributions of
weaker ones. To address this challenge, we first propose Multimodal Mixup (MM),
which applies the Mixup strategy at the aggregated multimodal feature level to
mitigate overfitting by generating virtual feature-label pairs. While MM
effectively improves generalization, it treats all modalities uniformly and
does not account for modality imbalance during training. Building on MM, we
further introduce Balanced Multimodal Mixup (B-MM), which dynamically adjusts
the mixing ratios for each modality based on their relative contributions to
the learning objective. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness of our methods in improving generalization and multimodal
robustness.

TL;DR: The paper surveys emerging Agentic Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), focusing on their conceptual framework, tools, interactions, and applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the growing interest in agentic AI systems and their potential trajectory toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

Method: The authors establish a conceptual framework for agentic MLLMs, organize dimensions (internal intelligence, external tool invocation, and environment interaction), compile open-source resources, and outline future directions.

Result: The paper successfully delineates agentic MLLMs' distinctions from conventional MLLMs, organizes them into three core functions, and provides resources like training frameworks and datasets.

Conclusion: Agentic MLLMs represent a dynamic approach to AI that combines reasoning, tool usage, and interactions with environments; the field requires further research and development.

Abstract: With the recent emergence of revolutionary autonomous agentic systems,
research community is witnessing a significant shift from traditional static,
passive, and domain-specific AI agents toward more dynamic, proactive, and
generalizable agentic AI. Motivated by the growing interest in agentic AI and
its potential trajectory toward AGI, we present a comprehensive survey on
Agentic Multimodal Large Language Models (Agentic MLLMs). In this survey, we
explore the emerging paradigm of agentic MLLMs, delineating their conceptual
foundations and distinguishing characteristics from conventional MLLM-based
agents. We establish a conceptual framework that organizes agentic MLLMs along
three fundamental dimensions: (i) Agentic internal intelligence functions as
the system's commander, enabling accurate long-horizon planning through
reasoning, reflection, and memory; (ii) Agentic external tool invocation,
whereby models proactively use various external tools to extend their
problem-solving capabilities beyond their intrinsic knowledge; and (iii)
Agentic environment interaction further situates models within virtual or
physical environments, allowing them to take actions, adapt strategies, and
sustain goal-directed behavior in dynamic real-world scenarios. To further
accelerate research in this area for the community, we compile open-source
training frameworks, training and evaluation datasets for developing agentic
MLLMs. Finally, we review the downstream applications of agentic MLLMs and
outline future research directions for this rapidly evolving field. To
continuously track developments in this rapidly evolving field, we will also
actively update a public repository at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of ensuring multi-view consistency in 3D Gaussian inpainting, which is crucial for achieving high-quality virtual reality and multimedia experiences.

Method: PAInpainter employs an iterative process of refining inpainting and optimizing 3D Gaussian representations via adaptive multiple views, integrating perspective-aware propagation to improve image quality and consistency.

Result: PAInpainter achieves PSNR scores of 26.03 dB and 29.51 dB on benchmark datasets SPIn-NeRF and NeRFiller, outperforming existing approaches in 3D inpainting quality.

Conclusion: PAInpainter significantly advances the field of 3D Gaussian inpainting, enhancing multi-view consistency and texture fidelity, thus making it highly effective for complex multimedia applications.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian inpainting, a critical technique for numerous applications in
virtual reality and multimedia, has made significant progress with pretrained
diffusion models. However, ensuring multi-view consistency, an essential
requirement for high-quality inpainting, remains a key challenge. In this work,
we present PAInpainter, a novel approach designed to advance 3D Gaussian
inpainting by leveraging perspective-aware content propagation and consistency
verification across multi-view inpainted images. Our method iteratively refines
inpainting and optimizes the 3D Gaussian representation with multiple views
adaptively sampled from a perspective graph. By propagating inpainted images as
prior information and verifying consistency across neighboring views,
PAInpainter substantially enhances global consistency and texture fidelity in
restored 3D scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
PAInpainter over existing methods. Our approach achieves superior 3D inpainting
quality, with PSNR scores of 26.03 dB and 29.51 dB on the SPIn-NeRF and
NeRFiller datasets, respectively, highlighting its effectiveness and
generalization capability.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ContextGen, a Diffusion Transformer framework for precise multi-instance image generation via layout and reference image guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of achieving accurate control over object layout and preserving identity consistency of multiple subjects in multi-instance image generation.

Method: ContextGen incorporates two mechanisms: Contextual Layout Anchoring (CLA) for positioning objects accurately, and Identity Consistency Attention (ICA) for maintaining subject identity using reference images.

Result: ContextGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in control precision, identity fidelity, and visual quality compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: ContextGen effectively addresses key limitations of diffusion models in multi-instance generation and introduces a new dataset, IMIG-100K, advancing research in this domain.

Abstract: Multi-instance image generation (MIG) remains a significant challenge for
modern diffusion models due to key limitations in achieving precise control
over object layout and preserving the identity of multiple distinct subjects.
To address these limitations, we introduce ContextGen, a novel Diffusion
Transformer framework for multi-instance generation that is guided by both
layout and reference images. Our approach integrates two key technical
contributions: a Contextual Layout Anchoring (CLA) mechanism that incorporates
the composite layout image into the generation context to robustly anchor the
objects in their desired positions, and Identity Consistency Attention (ICA),
an innovative attention mechanism that leverages contextual reference images to
ensure the identity consistency of multiple instances. Recognizing the lack of
large-scale, hierarchically-structured datasets for this task, we introduce
IMIG-100K, the first dataset with detailed layout and identity annotations.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that ContextGen sets a new state-of-the-art,
outperforming existing methods in control precision, identity fidelity, and
overall visual quality.

*Kai Han,Siqi Ma,Chengxuan Qian,Jun Chen,Chongwen Lyu,Yuqing Song,Zhe Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Foreground-Aware Spectrum Segmentation (FASS) framework for improved medical image segmentation, particularly in low-contrast scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard foundation models struggle with segmentation tasks under complex, low-contrast medical imaging scenarios where tumors resemble normal organs.

Method: The FASS framework includes three modules: a foreground-aware module for emphasizing target areas, a wavelet-transform-based frequency enhancement module for improving feature boundaries, and an edge constraint module for preserving segmentation geometry.

Result: FASS demonstrated superior performance in experiments across multiple medical datasets, excelling in robustness under challenging conditions and precise recognition of fine structures.

Conclusion: The framework addresses challenges in low-contrast medical image segmentation, offering improved performance and broader applicability in medical imaging applications.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of tumors and adjacent normal tissues in medical images
is essential for surgical planning and tumor staging. Although foundation
models generally perform well in segmentation tasks, they often struggle to
focus on foreground areas in complex, low-contrast backgrounds, where some
malignant tumors closely resemble normal organs, complicating contextual
differentiation. To address these challenges, we propose the Foreground-Aware
Spectrum Segmentation (FASS) framework. First, we introduce a foreground-aware
module to amplify the distinction between background and the entire volume
space, allowing the model to concentrate more effectively on target areas.
Next, a feature-level frequency enhancement module, based on wavelet transform,
extracts discriminative high-frequency features to enhance boundary recognition
and detail perception. Eventually, we introduce an edge constraint module to
preserve geometric continuity in segmentation boundaries. Extensive experiments
on multiple medical datasets demonstrate superior performance across all
metrics, validating the effectiveness of our framework, particularly in
robustness under complex conditions and fine structure recognition. Our
framework significantly enhances segmentation of low-contrast images, paving
the way for applications in more diverse and complex medical imaging scenarios.

*Sanchit Sinha,Guangzhi Xiong,Aidong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'COCO-Tree', a neurosymbolic approach to enhance compositional reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs), demonstrating significant performance improvement (5-10%) on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the persistent weakness of modern VLMs in compositional reasoning, particularly in tasks involving complex interactions of objects, attributes, and relations.

Method: The proposed approach, COCO-Tree, augments VLM outputs with neurosymbolic concept trees learned from large language models (LLMs) to enhance reasoning capabilities. It employs a beam search-inspired reasoning process for better compositional understanding and provides rationale behind predictions.

Result: COCO-Tree significantly improves compositional generalization by 5-10% over baselines across four benchmarks (Winoground, EqBench, ColorSwap, and SugarCrepe) using seven different open-source VLMs.

Conclusion: COCO-Tree effectively enhances the linguistic reasoning of VLMs, providing both performance improvements and interpretable reasoning processes in compositional tasks.

Abstract: Compositional reasoning remains a persistent weakness of modern vision
language models (VLMs): they often falter when a task hinges on understanding
how multiple objects, attributes, and relations interact within an image.
Multiple research works have attempted to improve compositionality performance
by creative tricks such as improving prompt structure, chain of thought
reasoning, etc. A more recent line of work attempts to impart additional
reasoning in VLMs using well-trained Large Language Models (LLMs), which are
far superior in linguistic understanding than VLMs to compensate for the
limited linguistic prowess of VLMs. However, these approaches are either
resource-intensive or do not provide an interpretable reasoning process. In
this paper, we present 'COCO-Tree' - a novel approach that augments VLM outputs
with carefully designed neurosymbolic concept trees learned from LLMs to
improve VLM's linguistic reasoning. COCO-Tree's beam search-inspired reasoning
process boosts compositionality performance and provides a rationale behind VLM
predictions. Empirical results on four compositionality benchmarks, Winoground,
EqBench, ColorSwap, and SugarCrepe, in seven different open-source VLMs with
varying sizes, demonstrate that COCO-Tree significantly improves compositional
generalization by 5-10% over baselines.

### [380] [High-Resolution Spatiotemporal Modeling with Global-Local State Space Models for Video-Based Human Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11017)
*Runyang Feng,Hyung Jin Chang,Tze Ho Elden Tse,Boeun Kim,Yi Chang,Yixing Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a new framework that extends the state space model Mamba to improve video-based human pose estimation (VHPE) by separately addressing global and local spatiotemporal representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in balancing global dynamic contexts and local motion details in video-based human pose estimation, while overcoming computational inefficiencies of state-of-the-art methods.

Method: The framework introduces two components: Global Spatiotemporal Mamba for efficient global context modeling and Local Refinement Mamba to refine high-frequency local keypoint motions, both designed to handle high-resolution sequences.

Result: The proposed model outperforms current state-of-the-art VHPE methods on four benchmark datasets and offers improved computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The framework successfully balances global and local dynamic modeling for VHPE, setting a new standard for accuracy and efficiency in the domain.

Abstract: Modeling high-resolution spatiotemporal representations, including both
global dynamic contexts (e.g., holistic human motion tendencies) and local
motion details (e.g., high-frequency changes of keypoints), is essential for
video-based human pose estimation (VHPE). Current state-of-the-art methods
typically unify spatiotemporal learning within a single type of modeling
structure (convolution or attention-based blocks), which inherently have
difficulties in balancing global and local dynamic modeling and may bias the
network to one of them, leading to suboptimal performance. Moreover, existing
VHPE models suffer from quadratic complexity when capturing global
dependencies, limiting their applicability especially for high-resolution
sequences. Recently, the state space models (known as Mamba) have demonstrated
significant potential in modeling long-range contexts with linear complexity;
however, they are restricted to 1D sequential data. In this paper, we present a
novel framework that extends Mamba from two aspects to separately learn global
and local high-resolution spatiotemporal representations for VHPE.
Specifically, we first propose a Global Spatiotemporal Mamba, which performs 6D
selective space-time scan and spatial- and temporal-modulated scan merging to
efficiently extract global representations from high-resolution sequences. We
further introduce a windowed space-time scan-based Local Refinement Mamba to
enhance the high-frequency details of localized keypoint motions. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed model
outperforms state-of-the-art VHPE approaches while achieving better
computational trade-offs.

*Shasha Guo,Liang Pang,Xi Wang,Yanling Wang,Huawei Shen,Jing Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GeoVLMath, a model using reinforcement learning to enhance vision-language alignment in solving solid geometry problems with auxiliary lines, outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges faced by large vision-language models (LVLMs) in solving geometric problems involving auxiliary lines, due to limitations in precise diagram editing and representation.

Method: The authors use reinforcement learning with a cross-modal reward system to enhance diagram-text alignment. They train the GeoVLMath model with a scalable dataset called AuxSolidMath.

Result: GeoVLMath, at both 3B and 7B scales, outperforms existing open-source and proprietary LVLMs on tasks involving auxiliary-line reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: The approach proves the efficacy of reinforcement learning and cross-modal alignment in improving geometric problem-solving capacities of LVLMs by leveraging textual representations over diagram editing.

Abstract: Auxiliary lines are essential for solving complex geometric problems but
remain challenging for large vision-language models (LVLMs). Rather than
editing diagrams to draw auxiliary lines, which current image editing models
struggle to render with geometric precision, we generate textual descriptions
of auxiliary-line constructions to better align with the representational
strengths of LVLMs. To bridge the gap between textual descriptions and spatial
structure, we propose a reinforcement learning framework that enhances
diagram-text alignment. At the core of our approach is a cross-modal reward
that evaluates how well the generated auxiliary-line description for an
original diagram matches a ground-truth auxiliary-line diagram. Built on this
reward, we present GeoVLMath, an open-source LVLM tailored to auxiliary-line
reasoning in solid geometry. This fine-grained signal drives a GRPO-based RL
stage, yielding precise diagram-text alignment. To support training, we develop
a scalable data creation pipeline and construct AuxSolidMath, a dataset of
3,018 real-exam geometry problems with paired diagrams and aligned textual
fields. At the 3B and 7B scales, GeoVLMath achieves competitive and often
superior performance compared with strong open-source and proprietary LVLMs on
auxiliary-line reasoning benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GIR-Bench, a benchmark designed for evaluating unified multimodal models on reasoning-centric tasks, bridging understanding and generation in multimodal systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The community lacks a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate how well unified multimodal models align their understanding and generation capabilities, especially in reasoning-centric tasks.

Method: GIR-Bench consists of three evaluation subsets: (1) Understanding-generation consistency (UGC), (2) Reasoning-driven text-to-image generation (T2I), and (3) Multi-step editing reasoning (Edit), each with tailored assessments.

Result: Experiments reveal that unified models perform better on reasoning-driven visual tasks but show an understanding-generation alignment gap, compared to generation-only systems.

Conclusion: Though promising, unified models still fall short in consistently aligning visual understanding and generation, highlighting areas for future improvement in multimodal intelligence.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models integrate the reasoning capacity of large language
models with both image understanding and generation, showing great promise for
advanced multimodal intelligence. However, the community still lacks a rigorous
reasoning-centric benchmark to systematically evaluate the alignment between
understanding and generation, and their generalization potential in complex
visual tasks. To this end, we introduce \textbf{GIR-Bench}, a comprehensive
benchmark that evaluates unified models across three complementary
perspectives. Firstly, we investigate understanding-generation consistency
(GIR-Bench-UGC), asking whether models can consistently leverage the same
knowledge in both understanding and generation tasks. Secondly, we investigate
whether models can perform reasoning-centric text-to-image generation that
requires applying logical constraints and implicit knowledge to generate
faithful visual content (GIR-Bench-T2I). Thirdly, we evaluate whether models
can handle multi-step reasoning in editing (GIR-Bench-Edit). For each subset,
we carefully design different task-specific evaluation pipelines tailored for
each task. This enables fine-grained and interpretable evaluation while
mitigating biases from the prevalent MLLM-as-a-Judge paradigm. Extensive
ablations over various unified models and generation-only systems have shown
that: Although unified models are more capable of reasoning-driven visual
tasks, they still exhibit a persistent gap between understanding and
generation. The data and code for GIR-Bench are available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Vlaser," a Vision-Language-Action Model designed to bridge reasoning and control gaps in robot policy learning, achieving state-of-the-art embodied reasoning and control results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There exists a gap between high-level reasoning using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and low-level control in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for robot control.

Method: The authors developed "Vlaser," a model that integrates high-level reasoning with low-level control, using a new dataset (Vlaser-6M) and tested it across embodied reasoning benchmarks. They also analyzed the impact of VLM initialization on policy learning.

Result: Vlaser demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in embodied reasoning tasks (e.g., spatial reasoning, task planning) and showed strong results on robot control benchmarks (WidowX and Google Robot).

Conclusion: Vlaser presents a significant step forward in connecting embodied reasoning with action, with insights for mitigating domain shifts in policy learning.

Abstract: While significant research has focused on developing embodied reasoning
capabilities using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) or integrating advanced VLMs
into Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for end-to-end robot control, few
studies directly address the critical gap between upstream VLM-based reasoning
and downstream VLA policy learning. In this work, we take an initial step
toward bridging embodied reasoning with VLA policy learning by introducing
Vlaser - a Vision-Language-Action Model with synergistic embodied reasoning
capability, which is a foundational vision-language model designed to integrate
high-level reasoning with low-level control for embodied agents. Built upon the
high-quality Vlaser-6M dataset, Vlaser achieves state-of-the-art performance
across a range of embodied reasoning benchmarks - including spatial reasoning,
embodied grounding, embodied QA, and task planning. Furthermore, we
systematically examine how different VLM initializations affect supervised VLA
fine-tuning, offering novel insights into mitigating the domain shift between
internet-scale pre-training data and embodied-specific policy learning data.
Based on these insights, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the
WidowX benchmark and competitive performance on the Google Robot benchmark.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel two-stage framework leverages CLIP and SAM for better zero-shot anomaly segmentation in industrial settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current challenge in zero-shot anomaly segmentation is effectively guiding foundation models like CLIP and SAM for precise downstream tasks.

Method: The framework uses two modules: Co-Feature Point Prompt Generation (PPG) for focusing on anomalous regions, and Cascaded Prompts for SAM (CPS) for enhancing segmentation precision.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance, improving metrics significantly on datasets such as Visa by 10.3% in F1-max and 7.7% in AP.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively advances zero-shot anomaly segmentation, addressing shortcomings in foundation model guidance and segmentation refinement.

Abstract: Recently, the powerful generalization ability exhibited by foundation models
has brought forth new solutions for zero-shot anomaly segmentation tasks.
However, guiding these foundation models correctly to address downstream tasks
remains a challenge. This paper proposes a novel two-stage framework, for
zero-shot anomaly segmentation tasks in industrial anomaly detection. This
framework excellently leverages the powerful anomaly localization capability of
CLIP and the boundary perception ability of SAM.(1) To mitigate SAM's
inclination towards object segmentation, we propose the Co-Feature Point Prompt
Generation (PPG) module. This module collaboratively utilizes CLIP and SAM to
generate positive and negative point prompts, guiding SAM to focus on
segmenting anomalous regions rather than the entire object. (2) To further
optimize SAM's segmentation results and mitigate rough boundaries and isolated
noise, we introduce the Cascaded Prompts for SAM (CPS) module. This module
employs hybrid prompts cascaded with a lightweight decoder of SAM, achieving
precise segmentation of anomalous regions. Across multiple datasets, consistent
experimental validation demonstrates that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art zero-shot anomaly segmentation results. Particularly
noteworthy is our performance on the Visa dataset, where we outperform the
state-of-the-art methods by 10.3\% and 7.7\% in terms of {$F_1$-max} and AP
metrics, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of standardized datasets in laryngeal cancer imaging hinder reproducible deep learning model development to improve clinical decision-making.

Method: The LaryngealCT dataset is created using weakly supervised extraction techniques validated by clinical experts, followed by benchmarking deep learning models (3D CNN, ResNet variants, DenseNet) on specific classification tasks.

Result: 3D CNN and ResNet18 produced top performance in classifying early vs advanced and T4 vs non-T4 cancer stages respectively. Explainability tools like 3D GradCAMs demonstrated clear activation patterns aligned with clinical relevance.

Conclusion: LaryngealCT provides a robust dataset along with pretrained models and explainability tools, laying a solid foundation for advancing reproducible AI research in laryngeal cancer imaging and clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Laryngeal cancer imaging research lacks standardised datasets to enable
reproducible deep learning (DL) model development. We present LaryngealCT, a
curated benchmark of 1,029 computed tomography (CT) scans aggregated from six
collections from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). Uniform 1 mm isotropic
volumes of interest encompassing the larynx were extracted using a weakly
supervised parameter search framework validated by clinical experts. 3D DL
architectures (3D CNN, ResNet18,50,101, DenseNet121) were benchmarked on (i)
early (Tis,T1,T2) vs. advanced (T3,T4) and (ii) T4 vs. non-T4 classification
tasks. 3D CNN (AUC-0.881, F1-macro-0.821) and ResNet18 (AUC-0.892,
F1-macro-0.646) respectively outperformed the other models in the two tasks.
Model explainability assessed using 3D GradCAMs with thyroid cartilage overlays
revealed greater peri-cartilage attention in non-T4 cases and focal activations
in T4 predictions. Through open-source data, pretrained models, and integrated
explainability tools, LaryngealCT offers a reproducible foundation for

*Yang Hou,Minggu Wang,Jianjun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a zero-shot face editing method to overcome limitations in ID and structural consistency during real face editing tasks using text-guided diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-guided diffusion models face challenges in preserving identity (ID) and structural consistency during face editing tasks.

Method: The authors propose ID-Attribute Decoupled Inversion, which separates face representation into ID and attribute features, guiding both inversion and reverse diffusion for precise and independent control.

Result: The method allows for complex multi-attribute face editing via text prompts while maintaining strong ID preservation and structural integrity.

Conclusion: The proposed technique is effective and practical for text-guided face editing tasks, providing a solution with competitive speed and functionality.

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-guided diffusion models have shown promise for
general image editing via inversion techniques, but often struggle to maintain
ID and structural consistency in real face editing tasks. To address this
limitation, we propose a zero-shot face editing method based on ID-Attribute
Decoupled Inversion. Specifically, we decompose the face representation into ID
and attribute features, using them as joint conditions to guide both the
inversion and the reverse diffusion processes. This allows independent control
over ID and attributes, ensuring strong ID preservation and structural
consistency while enabling precise facial attribute manipulation. Our method
supports a wide range of complex multi-attribute face editing tasks using only
text prompts, without requiring region-specific input, and operates at a speed
comparable to DDIM inversion. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate its
practicality and effectiveness.

TL;DR: The paper summarizes the 7th Large-scale Video Object Segmentation Challenge held during ICCV 2025, introducing a new track called MOSEv2.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate and improve robustness in video segmentation under realistic and challenging scenarios.

Method: An overview of datasets, metrics (including new metric J∙F), protocols, and solutions is provided, with insights on trends like LLM/MLLM components and memory-aware propagation.

Result: MOSEv2 introduces enhanced complexity in scenarios, influencing top-performing methods and novel approaches in video segmentation.

Conclusion: The challenge proposes advancements in benchmarks, methods, and understanding the future of video segmentation models for real-world applications.

Abstract: This report presents an overview of the 7th Large-scale Video Object
Segmentation (LSVOS) Challenge held in conjunction with ICCV 2025. Besides the
two traditional tracks of LSVOS that jointly target robustness in realistic
video scenarios: Classic VOS (VOS), and Referring VOS (RVOS), the 2025 edition
features a newly introduced track, Complex VOS (MOSEv2). Building upon prior
insights, MOSEv2 substantially increases difficulty, introducing more
challenging but realistic scenarios including denser small objects, frequent
disappear/reappear events, severe occlusions, adverse weather and lighting,
etc., pushing long-term consistency and generalization beyond curated
benchmarks. The challenge retains standard ${J}$, $F$, and ${J\&F}$ metrics for
VOS and RVOS, while MOSEv2 adopts ${J\&\dot{F}}$ as the primary ranking metric
to better evaluate objects across scales and disappearance cases. We summarize
datasets and protocols, highlight top-performing solutions, and distill
emerging trends, such as the growing role of LLM/MLLM components and
memory-aware propagation, aiming to chart future directions for resilient,
language-aware video segmentation in the wild.

Abstract: Patient face images provide a convenient mean for evaluating eye diseases,
while also raising privacy concerns. Here, we introduce ROFI, a deep
learning-based privacy protection framework for ophthalmology. Using weakly
supervised learning and neural identity translation, ROFI anonymizes facial
features while retaining disease features (over 98\% accuracy, $\kappa >

### [389] [Source-Free Object Detection with Detection Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11090)
*Huizai Yao,Sicheng Zhao,Shuo Lu,Hui Chen,Yangyang Li,Guoping Liu,Tengfei Xing,Chenggang Yan,Jianhua Tao,Guiguang Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes FRANCK, an advanced framework to enable Source-Free Object Detection (SFOD) specifically for DETR models, using innovative modules such as objectness reweighting and contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SFOD methods lack focus on the novel Detection Transformer (DETR) architecture and its specific adaptations, while relying on more conventional object detection models.

Method: FRANCK framework introduces four tailored components: (1) OSSR for multi-scale attention-based objectness scoring, (2) CMMB for memory bank-enhanced contrastive learning, (3) UQFD for improved feature distillation, and (4) a self-training pipeline with DTUI for better pseudo-label optimization.

Result: FRANCK demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, showcasing its compatibility and robustness in adapting DETR models for source-free object detection.

Conclusion: The method effectively bridges the gap for adapting DETR-based object detection in source-free settings, leveraging its novel components to enhance robustness and generalization.

Abstract: Source-Free Object Detection (SFOD) enables knowledge transfer from a source
domain to an unsupervised target domain for object detection without access to
source data. Most existing SFOD approaches are either confined to conventional
object detection (OD) models like Faster R-CNN or designed as general solutions
without tailored adaptations for novel OD architectures, especially Detection
Transformer (DETR). In this paper, we introduce Feature Reweighting ANd
Contrastive Learning NetworK (FRANCK), a novel SFOD framework specifically
designed to perform query-centric feature enhancement for DETRs. FRANCK
comprises four key components: (1) an Objectness Score-based Sample Reweighting
(OSSR) module that computes attention-based objectness scores on multi-scale
encoder feature maps, reweighting the detection loss to emphasize
less-recognized regions; (2) a Contrastive Learning with Matching-based Memory
Bank (CMMB) module that integrates multi-level features into memory banks,
enhancing class-wise contrastive learning; (3) an Uncertainty-weighted
Query-fused Feature Distillation (UQFD) module that improves feature
distillation through prediction quality reweighting and query feature fusion;
and (4) an improved self-training pipeline with a Dynamic Teacher Updating
Interval (DTUI) that optimizes pseudo-label quality. By leveraging these
components, FRANCK effectively adapts a source-pre-trained DETR model to a
target domain with enhanced robustness and generalization. Extensive
experiments on several widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its effectiveness and
compatibility with DETR-based SFOD models.

*Xianlin Liu,Yan Gong,Bohao Li,Jiajing Huang,Bowen Du,Junchen Ye,Liyan Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for panoptic symbol spotting in CAD drawings that incorporates textual annotations, combining geometric and textual data to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for analyzing CAD drawings lack the inclusion of textual annotations and fail to explicitly model relationships among geometric primitives, leading to incomplete understanding.

Method: The proposed method employs a unified representation model of geometric and textual primitives using pretrained CNNs for visual feature extraction and a Transformer-based backbone with a type-aware attention mechanism to model spatial dependencies.

Result: The proposed framework outperforms existing techniques in tasks involving textual annotations, showing greater robustness in complex CAD drawings.

Conclusion: Incorporating textual annotations and explicitly modeling spatial relationships significantly enhances the performance of panoptic symbol spotting in CAD drawings.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Computer-Aided Design(CAD) drawings in
engineering, architecture, and industrial design, the ability to accurately
interpret and analyze these drawings has become increasingly critical. Among
various subtasks, panoptic symbol spotting plays a vital role in enabling
downstream applications such as CAD automation and design retrieval. Existing
methods primarily focus on geometric primitives within the CAD drawings to
address this task, but they face following major problems: they usually
overlook the rich textual annotations present in CAD drawings and they lack
explicit modeling of relationships among primitives, resulting in
incomprehensive understanding of the holistic drawings. To fill this gap, we
propose a panoptic symbol spotting framework that incorporates textual
annotations. The framework constructs unified representations by jointly
modeling geometric and textual primitives. Then, using visual features extract
by pretrained CNN as the initial representations, a Transformer-based backbone
is employed, enhanced with a type-aware attention mechanism to explicitly model
the different types of spatial dependencies between various primitives.
Extensive experiments on the real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed
method outperforms existing approaches on symbol spotting tasks involving
textual annotations, and exhibits superior robustness when applied to complex
CAD drawings.

*Bozhou Zhang,Nan Song,Jingyu Li,Xiatian Zhu,Jiankang Deng,Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents "SeerDrive," a framework for autonomous driving that integrates future scene evolution and trajectory planning in a closed-loop manner, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autonomous driving approaches often operate on a one-shot paradigm, focusing on current scene context and neglecting temporal dynamics, limiting adaptability in complex scenarios.

Method: The SeerDrive framework predicts future bird's-eye view (BEV) representations, incorporates these into trajectory planning, and employs iterative optimization to jointly refine future scene predictions and trajectory generation.

Result: Experiments on NAVSIM and nuScenes demonstrated that SeerDrive significantly outperformed state-of-the-art methods in autonomous driving benchmarks.

Conclusion: Integrating future scene evolution and trajectory planning enhances autonomous driving systems' adaptability and decision-making in dynamic environments.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving methods aim to directly map raw sensor inputs
to future driving actions such as planned trajectories, bypassing traditional
modular pipelines. While these approaches have shown promise, they often
operate under a one-shot paradigm that relies heavily on the current scene
context, potentially underestimating the importance of scene dynamics and their
temporal evolution. This limitation restricts the model's ability to make
informed and adaptive decisions in complex driving scenarios. We propose a new
perspective: the future trajectory of an autonomous vehicle is closely
intertwined with the evolving dynamics of its environment, and conversely, the
vehicle's own future states can influence how the surrounding scene unfolds.
Motivated by this bidirectional relationship, we introduce SeerDrive, a novel
end-to-end framework that jointly models future scene evolution and trajectory
planning in a closed-loop manner. Our method first predicts future bird's-eye
view (BEV) representations to anticipate the dynamics of the surrounding scene,
then leverages this foresight to generate future-context-aware trajectories.
Two key components enable this: (1) future-aware planning, which injects
predicted BEV features into the trajectory planner, and (2) iterative scene
modeling and vehicle planning, which refines both future scene prediction and
trajectory generation through collaborative optimization. Extensive experiments
on the NAVSIM and nuScenes benchmarks show that SeerDrive significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

### [392] [CoDefend: Cross-Modal Collaborative Defense via Diffusion Purification and Prompt Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11096)
*Fengling Zhu,Boshi Liu,Jingyu Hua,Sheng Zhong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses vulnerabilities in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) due to adversarial attacks on their visual modality and proposes a supervised diffusion-based denoising framework to improve robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to enhance the security and robustness of MLLMs, which are susceptible to adversarial attacks through the visual modality, causing misleading and harmful outputs.

Method: A supervised diffusion-based denoising framework is introduced, leveraging paired adversarial-clean datasets to fine-tune diffusion models with task-specific guidance. The method includes complementary prompt optimization to defend against diverse and unseen attacks.

Result: Experiments show substantial improvements in robustness for tasks like image captioning and visual question answering, along with strong transferability to unknown adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively boosts defense mechanisms in multimodal tasks, paving the way for more secure deployment of MLLMs in practical scenarios.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
tasks such as image captioning, visual question answering, and cross-modal
reasoning by integrating visual and textual modalities. However, their
multimodal nature also exposes them to adversarial threats, where attackers can
perturb either modality or both jointly to induce harmful, misleading, or
policy violating outputs. Existing defense strategies, such as adversarial
training and input purification, face notable limitations: adversarial training
typically improves robustness only against known attacks while incurring high
computational costs, whereas conventional purification approaches often suffer
from degraded image quality and insufficient generalization to complex
multimodal tasks.
  In this work, we focus on defending the visual modality, which frequently
serves as the primary entry point for adversarial manipulation. We propose a
supervised diffusion based denoising framework that leverages paired
adversarial clean image datasets to fine-tune diffusion models with
directional, task specific guidance. Unlike prior unsupervised purification
methods such as DiffPure, our approach achieves higher quality reconstructions
while significantly improving defense robustness in multimodal tasks.
Furthermore, we incorporate prompt optimization as a complementary defense
mechanism, enhancing resistance against diverse and unseen attack strategies.
  Extensive experiments on image captioning and visual question answering
demonstrate that our method not only substantially improves robustness but also
exhibits strong transferability to unknown adversarial attacks. These results
highlight the effectiveness of supervised diffusion based denoising for
multimodal defense, paving the way for more reliable and secure deployment of
MLLMs in real world applications.

TL;DR: The paper provides a comprehensive survey on Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) in computer vision, categorizing and comparing existing methods, and outlining future challenges and directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the combinatorial challenge in recognizing unseen combinations of known attributes and objects without needing training data for every possible composition, and to provide a structured overview of the state-of-the-art in CZSL.

Method: The authors introduce a taxonomy to classify CZSL methods into four categories based on disentanglement: no explicit disentanglement, textual disentanglement, visual disentanglement, and cross-modal disentanglement. They then perform a detailed comparative analysis of these methods.

Result: The survey comprehensively reviews and compares the core advantages and limitations of various CZSL methods in different settings, including closed-world and open-world scenarios.

Conclusion: The survey highlights the most significant open challenges in CZSL and proposes future research directions, serving as a guide for advancements in this field.

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) is a critical task in computer vision
that enables models to recognize unseen combinations of known attributes and
objects during inference, addressing the combinatorial challenge of requiring
training data for every possible composition. This is particularly challenging
because the visual appearance of primitives is highly contextual; for example,
``small'' cats appear visually distinct from ``older'' ones, and ``wet'' cars
differ significantly from ``wet'' cats. Effectively modeling this contextuality
and the inherent compositionality is crucial for robust compositional zero-shot
recognition. This paper presents, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive
survey specifically focused on Compositional Zero-Shot Learning. We
systematically review the state-of-the-art CZSL methods, introducing a taxonomy
grounded in disentanglement, with four families of approaches: no explicit
disentanglement, textual disentanglement, visual disentanglement, and
cross-modal disentanglement. We provide a detailed comparative analysis of
these methods, highlighting their core advantages and limitations in different
problem settings, such as closed-world and open-world CZSL. Finally, we
identify the most significant open challenges and outline promising future
research directions. This survey aims to serve as a foundational resource to
guide and inspire further advancements in this fascinating and important field.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for predicting 3D scene motion from a single image using a novel representation, MoMap, and a diffusion model, trained on a large MoMap dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenge of learning meaningful 3D motion priors for scene prediction and synthesis from videos.

Method: Creation of MoMaps for representing motion, a dataset derived from over 50,000 videos, and training a diffusion model on these MoMap representations.

Result: The proposed approach successfully generates plausible and semantically consistent 3D scene motion, showcasing its utility in both 3D trajectory synthesis and 2D video pipelines.

Conclusion: The study presents an effective system for translating MoMaps into future 3D motion predictions, offering new insights into motion simulation and video generation workflows.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of learning semantically and functionally
meaningful 3D motion priors from real-world videos, in order to enable
prediction of future 3D scene motion from a single input image. We propose a
novel pixel-aligned Motion Map (MoMap) representation for 3D scene motion,
which can be generated from existing generative image models to facilitate
efficient and effective motion prediction. To learn meaningful distributions
over motion, we create a large-scale database of MoMaps from over 50,000 real
videos and train a diffusion model on these representations. Our motion
generation not only synthesizes trajectories in 3D but also suggests a new
pipeline for 2D video synthesis: first generate a MoMap, then warp an image
accordingly and complete the warped point-based renderings. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach generates plausible and semantically
consistent 3D scene motion.

*Chen Liu,Wenfang Yao,Kejing Yin,William K. Cheung,Jing Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Longitudinal multimodal data, including sequential chest X-rays and electronic health records, faces challenges in redundancy and temporal misalignment. The paper introduces DiPro, a framework to disentangle anatomical and pathology progression features and hierarchically align multi-timescale data. DiPro achieves state-of-the-art results in disease progression modeling and ICU prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to better utilize longitudinal multimodal data, such as EHRs and sequential CXRs, for disease modeling. Existing approaches face challenges with redundancy and temporal misalignment in the data.

Method: DiPro disentangles static anatomy from dynamic pathology features in chest X-rays and hierarchically aligns these features with electronic health records at local and global levels using multi-timescale synchronization.

Result: DiPro was tested on the MIMIC dataset and demonstrated effective extraction of temporal clinical dynamics. It outperformed previous methods in tasks related to disease progression identification and ICU prediction.

Conclusion: DiPro addresses challenges in utilizing multimodal data, successfully integrates disparate health data sources, and offers an effective tool for disease modeling and ICU outcome prediction.

Abstract: Longitudinal multimodal data, including electronic health records (EHR) and
sequential chest X-rays (CXRs), is critical for modeling disease progression,
yet remains underutilized due to two key challenges: (1) redundancy in
consecutive CXR sequences, where static anatomical regions dominate over
clinically-meaningful dynamics, and (2) temporal misalignment between sparse,
irregular imaging and continuous EHR data. We introduce $\texttt{DiPro}$, a
novel framework that addresses these challenges through region-aware
disentanglement and multi-timescale alignment. First, we disentangle static
(anatomy) and dynamic (pathology progression) features in sequential CXRs,
prioritizing disease-relevant changes. Second, we hierarchically align these
static and dynamic CXR features with asynchronous EHR data via local (pairwise
interval-level) and global (full-sequence) synchronization to model coherent
progression pathways. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC dataset demonstrate
that $\texttt{DiPro}$ could effectively extract temporal clinical dynamics and
achieve state-of-the-art performance on both disease progression identification
and general ICU prediction tasks.

*Hao Tang,Shengfeng He,Jing Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Synergistic Knowledge Transfer (SynTrans), a novel framework leveraging large multimodal models to improve few-shot learning (FSL) with limited samples, showing superior results compared to previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few-shot learning struggles with classifying new categories due to limited training data. Existing methods using semantic knowledge often suffer from noise and bias related to data simplicity.

Method: SynTrans transfers knowledge from large multimodal models (like CLIP) to a simple few-shot vision encoder through components such as unsupervised distillation, synergistic knowledge mining, and bi-directional knowledge transfer modules.

Result: SynTrans achieves significant performance improvements on four few-shot learning datasets, outperforming current state-of-the-art approaches despite using a simple vision encoder.

Conclusion: The proposed SynTrans framework proves effective in enhancing few-shot classification capabilities, leveraging multimodal knowledge transfer to construct adaptive and optimized classifiers.

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) addresses the challenge of classifying novel classes
with limited training samples. While some methods leverage semantic knowledge
from smaller-scale models to mitigate data scarcity, these approaches often
introduce noise and bias due to the data's inherent simplicity. In this paper,
we propose a novel framework, Synergistic Knowledge Transfer (SynTrans), which
effectively transfers diverse and complementary knowledge from large multimodal
models to empower the off-the-shelf few-shot learner. Specifically, SynTrans
employs CLIP as a robust teacher and uses a few-shot vision encoder as a weak
student, distilling semantic-aligned visual knowledge via an unsupervised proxy
task. Subsequently, a training-free synergistic knowledge mining module
facilitates collaboration among large multimodal models to extract high-quality
semantic knowledge. Building upon this, a visual-semantic bridging module
enables bi-directional knowledge transfer between visual and semantic spaces,
transforming explicit visual and implicit semantic knowledge into
category-specific classifier weights. Finally, SynTrans introduces a visual
weight generator and a semantic weight reconstructor to adaptively construct
optimal multimodal FSL classifiers. Experimental results on four FSL datasets
demonstrate that SynTrans, even when paired with a simple few-shot vision
encoder, significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

### [397] [Demystifying Numerosity in Diffusion Models -- Limitations and Remedies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11117)
*Yaqi Zhao,Xiaochen Wang,Li Dong,Wentao Zhang,Yuhui Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether scaling up datasets and model sizes on diffusion models can naturally enhance counting accuracy in text-to-image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art text-to-image models struggle with following counting instructions in prompts, leading to inaccuracies in generating the correct number of objects.

Method: The authors create a synthetic numerosity benchmark (GrayCount250 and NaturalCount6) and analyze the impact of scaling datasets and model sizes. They also propose a method to control numerosity via count-aware layout information in the noise prior.

Result: The scaling hypothesis was proven inaccurate, as larger models and datasets did not improve counting accuracy. Incorporating count-aware layouts significantly enhanced counting accuracy on benchmarks.

Conclusion: Injecting count-aware layout information into the noise initialization effectively mitigates counting biases in diffusion models and improves performance.

Abstract: Numerosity remains a challenge for state-of-the-art text-to-image generation
models like FLUX and GPT-4o, which often fail to accurately follow counting
instructions in text prompts. In this paper, we aim to study a fundamental yet
often overlooked question: Can diffusion models inherently generate the correct
number of objects specified by a textual prompt simply by scaling up the
dataset and model size? To enable rigorous and reproducible evaluation, we
construct a clean synthetic numerosity benchmark comprising two complementary
datasets: GrayCount250 for controlled scaling studies, and NaturalCount6
featuring complex naturalistic scenes. Second, we empirically show that the
scaling hypothesis does not hold: larger models and datasets alone fail to
improve counting accuracy on our benchmark. Our analysis identifies a key
reason: diffusion models tend to rely heavily on the noise initialization
rather than the explicit numerosity specified in the prompt. We observe that
noise priors exhibit biases toward specific object counts. In addition, we
propose an effective strategy for controlling numerosity by injecting
count-aware layout information into the noise prior. Our method achieves
significant gains, improving accuracy on GrayCount250 from 20.0\% to 85.3\% and
on NaturalCount6 from 74.8\% to 86.3\%, demonstrating effective generalization
across settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces video-SALMONN S, an LLM for processing 3-hour videos at 1 FPS and 360p resolution under fixed memory constraints, achieving superior long-video understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video-understanding LLMs struggle with scaling to long video streams either due to adapting frame rates or losing information while merging/discarding tokens.

Method: The method includes a TTT memory module for continuous token updates and a prompt-dependent memory reader for selective context retrieval, optimized with Hessian-free conjugate-gradient procedures.

Result: Video-SALMONN S achieves 74.2% overall accuracy and 67.8% on the Video-MME long split across long-video benchmarks, surpassing offline and streaming baselines.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates a viable approach to enable high-quality, scalable, and efficient processing of multi-hour video streams using fixed memory budgets.

Abstract: Continuous, high-frame-rate, high-resolution processing of long video streams
is critical for future AI agents, yet current video-understanding LLMs struggle
to scale. Offline, fixed-frame-number methods require the stream length to
adapt frame rates; streaming methods constrain memory by merging or discarding
tokens, losing information. We propose video-SALMONN S, a streaming
audio-visual LLM that, to our knowledge, is the first to process 3-hour videos
at 1 FPS and 360p resolution under a fixed memory budget. Our model introduces
(i) a test-time-training (TTT) memory module that continually updates token
representations to capture long-range dependencies by replacing token merging,
and (ii) a prompt-dependent memory reader that selectively retrieves
context-relevant content from fixed-size memory. The TTT module is optimised
with a Hessian-free conjugate-gradient procedure (TTT_HF) for efficient
adaptation. On long-video benchmarks (Video-MME, LVBench, VideoEvalPro),
video-SALMONN S sustains high-quality understanding on multi-hour videos with
10k frames and 1M tokens. Our 8B-parameter model achieves 74.2% overall and
67.8% on the Video-MME long split, outperforming both offline and streaming
baselines.

TL;DR: This study validates an AI tool to detect sperm DNA fragmentation (SDF) through phase contrast microscopy images, achieving sensitivity of 60% and specificity of 75%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional semen analysis does not evaluate sperm DNA fragmentation (SDF), a critical factor in male fertility. Developing a non-destructive tool for real-time assessment is essential for improved clinical diagnostics.

Method: The study uses a morphology-assisted ensemble AI model combining image processing techniques and transformer-based GC-ViT machine learning models. It benchmarks against a vision-only and morphology-only model.

Result: The proposed AI model achieved sensitivity of 60% and specificity of 75%, demonstrating its potential to evaluate SDF non-invasively.

Conclusion: The novel AI-based tool enables non-destructive, real-time sperm selection based on DNA integrity, marking a significant improvement in reproductive medicine diagnostics and therapeutic applications.

Abstract: Sperm DNA fragmentation (SDF) is a critical parameter in male fertility
assessment that conventional semen analysis fails to evaluate. This study
presents the validation of a novel artificial intelligence (AI) tool designed
to detect SDF through digital analysis of phase contrast microscopy images,
using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)
assay as the gold standard reference. Utilising the established link between
sperm morphology and DNA integrity, the present work proposes a morphology
assisted ensemble AI model that combines image processing techniques with
state-of-the-art transformer based machine learning models (GC-ViT) for the
prediction of DNA fragmentation in sperm from phase contrast images. The
ensemble model is benchmarked against a pure transformer `vision' model as well
as a `morphology-only` model. Promising results show the proposed framework is
able to achieve sensitivity of 60\% and specificity of 75\%. This
non-destructive methodology represents a significant advancement in
reproductive medicine by enabling real-time sperm selection based on DNA
integrity for clinical diagnostic and therapeutic applications.

### [400] [Multiview Manifold Evidential Fusion for PolSAR Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11171)
*Junfei Shi,Haojia Zhang,Haiyan Jin,Junhuai Li,Xiaogang Song,Yuanfan Guo,Haonan Su,Weisi Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Multiview Manifold Evidential Fusion (MMEFnet) method that effectively fuses PolSAR covariance matrices and multi-features using manifold learning and Dempster-Shafer theory for improved image classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve PolSAR image classification by addressing limitations in traditional fusion methods, which overlook varying view importance, uncertainty, and manifold differences.

Method: The method involves representing PolSAR covariance matrices on the HPD manifold and multi-features on the Grassmann manifold, learning their representations through kernel metric learning networks, and using a Dempster-Shafer-based evidence fusion strategy for classification.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates superior performance in accuracy, robustness, and interpretability through extensive experiments on three real-world PolSAR datasets.

Conclusion: Fusing complementary PolSAR features using manifold learning and evidence fusion leads to more reliable and interpretable classification, significantly outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) covariance matrices and their
extracted multi-features - such as scattering angle, entropy, texture, and
boundary descriptors - provide complementary and physically interpretable
information for image classification. Traditional fusion strategies typically
concatenate these features or employ deep learning networks to combine them.
However, the covariance matrices and multi-features, as two complementary
views, lie on different manifolds with distinct geometric structures. Existing
fusion methods also overlook the varying importance of different views and
ignore uncertainty, often leading to unreliable predictions. To address these
issues, we propose a Multiview Manifold Evidential Fusion (MMEFnet) method to
effectively fuse these two views. It gives a new framework to integrate PolSAR
manifold learning and evidence fusion into a unified architecture.
Specifically, covariance matrices are represented on the Hermitian Positive
Definite (HPD) manifold, while multi-features are modeled on the Grassmann
manifold. Two different kernel metric learning networks are constructed to
learn their manifold representations. Subsequently, a trusted multiview
evidence fusion, replacing the conventional softmax classifier, estimates
belief mass and quantifies the uncertainty of each view from the learned deep
features. Finally, a Dempster-Shafer theory-based fusion strategy combines
evidence, enabling a more reliable and interpretable classification. Extensive
experiments on three real-world PolSAR datasets demonstrate that the proposed
method consistently outperforms existing approaches in accuracy, robustness,
and interpretability.

*Zhenyu Lu,Liupeng Li,Jinpeng Wang,Yan Feng,Bin Chen,Ke Chen,Yaowei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoPRS, a model that uses multi-modal reasoning expressed through positional heatmaps to achieve state-of-the-art results in reasoning segmentation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models for reasoning segmentation lack interpretability and rich semantic detail, connecting text features to segmentation outcomes in a less transparent way.

Method: CoPRS includes a Multi-modal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) reasoning layer paired with a heatmap-based positional perception model to enhance interpretability. A learnable concentration token aggregates image and reasoning features for precise mask generation.

Result: CoPRS achieves or exceeds state-of-the-art performance on reasoning segmentation datasets like RefCOCO and ReasonSeg, particularly benefiting from improved heatmap quality.

Conclusion: The proposed CoPRS approach is effective in linking reasoning and segmentation tasks, with enhanced interpretability and precision attributable to its unique architecture.

Abstract: Existing works on reasoning segmentation either connect hidden features from
a language model directly to a mask decoder or represent positions in text,
which limits interpretability and semantic detail. To solve this, we present
CoPRS, a Multi-modal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT)-based positional perception model
that bridges language reasoning to segmentation through a differentiable and
interpretable positional prior instantiated as a heatmap. By making the
reasoning process clear via MCoT and expressing it as a dense, differentiable
heatmap, this interface enhances interpretability and diagnostic analysis and
yields more concentrated evidence on the target. A learnable concentration
token aggregates features of the image and reasoning text to generate this
positional prior, which is decoded to precise masks through a lightweight
decoder, providing a direct connection between reasoning and segmentation.
Across the RefCOCO series and ReasonSeg, CoPRS matches or surpasses the best
reported metrics on each standard split under comparable protocols, with
performance at or above prior state of the art across both validation and test
partitions. Extensive experiments reveal that the quality of the heatmap
strongly influences the resulting mask quality, supporting a consistent
association between the reasoning output and downstream mask generation.
Collectively, these findings support the utility of this paradigm in bridging
reasoning and segmentation and show advantages in concentration driven by
reasoning and predicting masks more precisely. Code, checkpoints and logs are
released at https://github.com/ZhenyuLU-Heliodore/CoPRS.git.

### [402] [Reliable Cross-modal Alignment via Prototype Iterative Construction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11175)
*Xiang Ma,Litian Xu,Lexin Fang,Caiming Zhang,Lizhen Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PICO, a framework to improve cross-modal alignment by suppressing style interference during embedding interaction, demonstrating notable performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional methods in cross-modal alignment that fail to separate style and semantic information effectively, leading to potential bias or information loss.

Method: PICO quantifies the probability of features representing semantic information and uses a prototype iterative construction method with a performance feedback-based weighting function to enhance semantic alignment reliability.

Result: PICO achieves significant performance improvements, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 5.2%-14.1% across various benchmarks and model backbones.

Conclusion: PICO effectively mitigates the impact of style information in cross-modal alignment, demonstrating its efficacy and reliability for improved multi-modal semantic understanding.

Abstract: Cross-modal alignment is an important multi-modal task, aiming to bridge the
semantic gap between different modalities. The most reliable fundamention for
achieving this objective lies in the semantic consistency between matched
pairs. Conventional methods implicitly assume embeddings contain solely
semantic information, ignoring the impact of non-semantic information during
alignment, which inevitably leads to information bias or even loss. These
non-semantic information primarily manifest as stylistic variations in the
data, which we formally define as style information. An intuitive approach is
to separate style from semantics, aligning only the semantic information.
However, most existing methods distinguish them based on feature columns, which
cannot represent the complex coupling relationship between semantic and style
information. In this paper, we propose PICO, a novel framework for suppressing
style interference during embedding interaction. Specifically, we quantify the
probability of each feature column representing semantic information, and
regard it as the weight during the embedding interaction. To ensure the
reliability of the semantic probability, we propose a prototype iterative
construction method. The key operation of this method is a performance
feedback-based weighting function, and we have theoretically proven that the
function can assign higher weight to prototypes that bring higher performance
improvements. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and model backbones
demonstrate the superiority of PICO, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by
5.2\%-14.1\%.

### [403] [G2L:From Giga-Scale to Cancer-Specific Large-Scale Pathology Foundation Models via Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11176)
*Yesung Cho,Sungmin Lee,Geongyu Lee,Minkyung Lee,Jongbae Park,Dongmyung Shin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study proposes a knowledge distillation framework (G2L) that transfers the capabilities of giga-scale pathology models to smaller-scale models, achieving comparable or better performance with significantly reduced computational demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Giga-scale pathology foundation models are effective but computationally expensive, making them impractical for widespread use.

Method: This study uses knowledge distillation to train large-scale models (15% the size of giga-scale models) by leveraging 1K pathology slides for specific cancer types (e.g., breast, prostate).

Result: The distilled models outperform state-of-the-art same-size models and, for some benchmarks, even their giga-scale counterparts, demonstrating enhanced robustness to image variations from various sources.

Conclusion: The G2L framework enables efficient knowledge transfer, making it possible to achieve high performance in cancer-specific tasks without the computational burden of giga-scale models.

Abstract: Recent studies in pathology foundation models have shown that scaling
training data, diversifying cancer types, and increasing model size
consistently improve their performance. However, giga-scale foundation models,
which are trained on hundreds of thousands of slides covering tens of cancer
types and contain billions of parameters, pose significant challenges for
practical use due to their tremendous computational costs in both development
and deployment. In this work, we present a novel strategy, named the G2L
framework, to increase the performance of large-scale foundation models, which
consist of only $15\%$ of the parameters of giga-scale models, to a comparable
performance level of giga-scale models in cancer-specific tasks. Our approach
applies knowledge distillation, transferring the capabilities of a giga-scale
model to a large-scale model, using just 1K pathology slides of a target cancer
(e.g., breast, prostate, etc.). The resulting distilled model not only
outperformed state-of-the-art models of the same size (i.e., large-scale)
across several benchmarks but also, interestingly, surpassed the giga-scale
teacher and huge-scale models in some benchmarks. In addition, the distilled
model exhibited a higher robustness index, indicating improved resilience to
image variations originating from multiple institutions. These findings suggest
that the proposed distillation approach for a large-scale model is a data- and
parameter-efficient way to achieve giga-scale-level performance for
cancer-specific applications without prohibitive computational burden.

*Bryan Chen Zhengyu Tan,Zheng Weihua,Zhengyuan Liu,Nancy F. Chen,Hwaran Lee,Kenny Tsu Wei Choo,Roy Ka-Wei Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BLEnD-Vis is a multimodal benchmark designed to evaluate the cultural understanding and robustness of vision-language models (VLMs) across different regions, linguistic variations, and visual contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the gap in assessing cultural robustness in vision-language models (VLMs), which is crucial as these models are deployed globally.

Method: The authors create BLEnD-Vis by extending the BLEnD dataset, formulating 313 cultural question templates across 16 regions, and generating three types of aligned multiple-choice formats. Images and questions were validated by human annotation to ensure reliability.

Result: Performance assessments using BLEnD-Vis demonstrate fragility in VLMs. Linguistic rephrasing and lower-resource regions significantly impact performance, while models struggle to integrate textual and visual information consistently across modalities.

Conclusion: BLEnD-Vis is an essential benchmark that exposes weaknesses in VLM cultural competence and integration. It serves as a guide for improving the cultural robustness and multimodal grounding of these models.

Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) are deployed globally, their ability to
understand culturally situated knowledge becomes essential. Yet, existing
evaluations largely assess static recall or isolated visual grounding, leaving
unanswered whether VLMs possess robust and transferable cultural understanding.
We introduce BLEnD-Vis, a multimodal, multicultural benchmark designed to
evaluate the robustness of everyday cultural knowledge in VLMs across
linguistic rephrasings and visual modalities. Building on the BLEnD dataset,
BLEnD-Vis constructs 313 culturally grounded question templates spanning 16
regions and generates three aligned multiple-choice formats: (i) a text-only
baseline querying from Region $\to$ Entity, (ii) an inverted text-only variant
(Entity $\to$ Region), and (iii) a VQA-style version of (ii) with generated
images. The resulting benchmark comprises 4,916 images and over 21,000
multiple-choice question (MCQ) instances, validated through human annotation.
BLEnD-Vis reveals significant fragility in current VLM cultural knowledge;
models exhibit performance drops under linguistic rephrasing and, whilst visual
cues often aid performance, low cross-modal consistency highlights challenges
in robustly integrating textual and visual understanding, particularly for
lower-resource regions. BLEnD-Vis thus provides a crucial testbed for
systematically analysing cultural robustness and multimodal grounding, exposing
limitations and guiding the development of more culturally competent VLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to enhance Saudi Sign Language translation systems by leveraging cross-linguistic transferability using American Sign Language pre-training.

Method: The methodology involves experiments with T5 models trained directly on SSL datasets compared to models pre-trained on the YouTubeASL dataset.

Result: Pre-training on large-scale ASL data dramatically improves BLEU-4 scores (approximately 3×), showcasing improved SSL translation performance.

Conclusion: Leveraging ASL pre-training enhances SSL translation systems, indicating promising cross-linguistic applications for sign language models.

Abstract: This paper explores the application of T5 models for Saudi Sign Language
(SSL) translation using a novel dataset. The SSL dataset includes three
challenging testing protocols, enabling comprehensive evaluation across
different scenarios. Additionally, it captures unique SSL characteristics, such
as face coverings, which pose challenges for sign recognition and translation.
In our experiments, we investigate the impact of pre-training on American Sign
Language (ASL) data by comparing T5 models pre-trained on the YouTubeASL
dataset with models trained directly on the SSL dataset. Experimental results
demonstrate that pre-training on YouTubeASL significantly improves models'
performance (roughly $3\times$ in BLEU-4), indicating cross-linguistic
transferability in sign language models. Our findings highlight the benefits of
leveraging large-scale ASL data to improve SSL translation and provide insights
into the development of more effective sign language translation systems. Our
code is publicly available at our GitHub repository.

*Shengming Yuan,Xinyu Lyu,Shuailong Wang,Beitao Chen,Jingkuan Song,Lianli Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FlexAC, a framework allowing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to flexibly balance creative and factual reasoning, enhancing adaptability across task types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle with balancing faithfulness and creativity due to their inability to modulate associative reasoning strength, limiting their adaptability across different tasks.

Method: The authors investigate the role of middle layers in associative reasoning, utilize hallucinations to derive steering vectors, and introduce FlexAC, a framework for regulating associative behavior without additional model training.

Result: FlexAC achieves up to a 5.8x improvement in creativity on Creation-MMBench and reduces hallucination rates by 29% on CHAIR, surpassing existing methods.

Conclusion: FlexAC provides a lightweight, training-free solution for modulating associative reasoning in MLLMs, enabling better adaptability to both factual and creative tasks, demonstrating significant effectiveness in empirical benchmarks.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) face an inherent trade-off between
faithfulness and creativity, as different tasks require varying degrees of
associative reasoning. However, existing methods lack the flexibility to
modulate this reasoning strength, limiting MLLMs' adaptability across factual
and creative scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose equipping MLLMs with
mechanisms that enable flexible control over associative reasoning. We begin by
investigating the internal mechanisms underlying associative behavior in MLLMs
and find that: (1) middle layers play a pivotal role in shaping model's
associative tendencies, (2) modifying representations in these layers
effectively regulates associative reasoning strength, and (3) hallucinations
can be exploited to derive steering vectors that guide this modulation.
Building on these findings, we introduce Flexible Association Control (FlexAC),
a lightweight and training-free framework for modulating associative behavior
in MLLMs. FlexAC first induces hallucination-guided intermediate
representations to encode associative directions. Then, it selects
high-association instances to construct effective associative steering vectors,
whose strengths are adaptively calibrated to balance creative guidance with
output stability. Finally, recognizing the multi-dimensional nature of
associative reasoning, FlexAC incorporates task-specific associative vectors
derived from a forward pass on a few target-domain samples, enabling models to
follow diverse associative directions and better adapt to creative tasks.
Notably, our method achieves up to a 5.8x improvement in creativity on
Creation-MMBench and a 29% reduction in hallucination rate on CHAIR, surpassing
existing baselines and demonstrating its effectiveness in enabling flexible
control over associative reasoning in MLLMs. Our code is available at

*Rohit Gupta,Anirban Roy,Claire Christensen,Sujeong Kim,Sarah Gerard,Madeline Cincebeaux,Ajay Divakaran,Todd Grindal,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to classify educational content in online videos, specifically in literacy and math, using a multimodal transformer and supervised contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the increase in young children's consumption of online media, there's a need for tools to identify appropriate educational content for early learners.

Method: The authors propose a class-prototypes-based supervised contrastive learning approach combined with a multimodal transformer for video analysis. They formulated the problem as a fine-grained multilabel classification task.

Result: Their method was validated on a new educational video dataset, APPROVE, and showed superior performance compared to strong baselines, including benchmarks like Youtube-8M and COIN.

Conclusion: This research provides a robust approach to accurately detect and classify educational content in videos, enhancing the resource pool for educators and addressing the challenges of analyzing fine-grained educational video content.

Abstract: The recent growth in the consumption of online media by children during early
childhood necessitates data-driven tools enabling educators to filter out
appropriate educational content for young learners. This paper presents an
approach for detecting educational content in online videos. We focus on two
widely used educational content classes: literacy and math. For each class, we
choose prominent codes (sub-classes) based on the Common Core Standards. For
example, literacy codes include `letter names', `letter sounds', and math codes
include `counting', `sorting'. We pose this as a fine-grained multilabel
classification problem as videos can contain multiple types of educational
content and the content classes can get visually similar (e.g., `letter names'
vs `letter sounds'). We propose a novel class prototypes based supervised
contrastive learning approach that can handle fine-grained samples associated
with multiple labels. We learn a class prototype for each class and a loss
function is employed to minimize the distances between a class prototype and
the samples from the class. Similarly, distances between a class prototype and
the samples from other classes are maximized. As the alignment between visual
and audio cues are crucial for effective comprehension, we consider a
multimodal transformer network to capture the interaction between visual and
audio cues in videos while learning the embedding for videos. For evaluation,
we present a dataset, APPROVE, employing educational videos from YouTube
labeled with fine-grained education classes by education researchers. APPROVE
consists of 193 hours of expert-annotated videos with 19 classes. The proposed
approach outperforms strong baselines on APPROVE and other benchmarks such as
Youtube-8M, and COIN. The dataset is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study demonstrates that individuals can be identified based on their facial expression dynamics, independent of static facial appearance, using advanced modeling techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether individuals can be recognized solely through their facial expression dynamics, independent of static aspects of their facial shapes.

Method: The FLAME 3D morphable model was used for disentangling facial shape and expression dynamics in conversational videos. Conformer models and supervised contrastive learning were applied for identity classification.

Result: Achieved a 61.14% accuracy on 1,429-way classification, significantly above chance, showing strong identity signatures in facial dynamics. The drift-to-noise ratio (DNR) metric also correlated with recognition performance.

Conclusion: Facial dynamics contain person-specific identity information, validated through robust modeling and metrics, with potential applications in social and clinical domains.

Abstract: This work investigates whether individuals can be identified solely through
the pure dynamical components of their facial expressions, independent of
static facial appearance. We leverage the FLAME 3D morphable model to achieve
explicit disentanglement between facial shape and expression dynamics,
extracting frame-by-frame parameters from conversational videos while retaining
only expression and jaw coefficients. On the CANDOR dataset of 1,429 speakers
in naturalistic conversations, our Conformer model with supervised contrastive
learning achieves 61.14\%accuracy on 1,429-way classification -- 458 times
above chance -- demonstrating that facial dynamics carry strong identity
signatures. We introduce a drift-to-noise ratio (DNR) that quantifies the
reliability of shape expression separation by measuring across-session shape
changes relative to within-session variability. DNR strongly negatively
correlates with recognition performance, confirming that unstable shape
estimation compromises dynamic identification. Our findings reveal
person-specific signatures in conversational facial dynamics, with implications
for social perception and clinical assessment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Difficulty in deploying large deep learning models in resource-limited settings prompted the development of an efficient solution for pneumonia detection.

Method: The paper introduces LightPneumoNet, a custom lightweight CNN trained on a dataset of 5,856 X-ray images with preprocessing steps and data augmentation to prevent overfitting.

Result: LightPneumoNet achieved impressive metrics: accuracy of 0.942, precision of 0.92, F1-score of 0.96, and sensitivity (recall) of 0.99.

Conclusion: LightPneumoNet provides a highly efficient and accurate tool for pneumonia diagnosis, suitable for deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments.

Abstract: Effective pneumonia diagnosis is often challenged by the difficulty of
deploying large, computationally expensive deep learning models in
resource-limited settings. This study introduces LightPneumoNet, an efficient,
lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) built from scratch to provide an
accessible and accurate diagnostic solution for pneumonia detection from chest
X-rays. Our model was trained on a public dataset of 5,856 chest X-ray images.
Preprocessing included image resizing to 224x224, grayscale conversion, and
pixel normalization, with data augmentation (rotation, zoom, shear) to prevent
overfitting. The custom architecture features four blocks of stacked
convolutional layers and contains only 388,082 trainable parameters, resulting
in a minimal 1.48 MB memory footprint. On the independent test set, our model
delivered exceptional performance, achieving an overall accuracy of 0.942,
precision of 0.92, and an F1-Score of 0.96. Critically, it obtained a
sensitivity (recall) of 0.99, demonstrating a near-perfect ability to identify
true pneumonia cases and minimize clinically significant false negatives.
Notably, LightPneumoNet achieves this high recall on the same dataset where
existing approaches typically require significantly heavier architectures or
fail to reach comparable sensitivity levels. The model's efficiency enables
deployment on low-cost hardware, making advanced computer-aided diagnosis
accessible in underserved clinics and serving as a reliable second-opinion tool
to improve patient outcomes.

Conclusion: The work pioneers benchmarking NSL datasets and shows the promise of convolutional neural networks, transfer learning, and fine-tuning for recognizing less-explored sign languages like NSL.

Abstract: Sign languages serve as essential communication systems for individuals with
hearing and speech impairments. However, digital linguistic dataset resources
for underrepresented sign languages, such as Nepali Sign Language (NSL), remain
scarce. This study introduces the first benchmark dataset for NSL, consisting
of 36 gesture classes with 1,500 samples per class, designed to capture the
structural and visual features of the language. To evaluate recognition
performance, we fine-tuned MobileNetV2 and ResNet50 architectures on the

respectively. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of convolutional
neural networks in sign recognition tasks, particularly within low-resource

Motivation: Medical image segmentation faces issues with limited structural representation and insufficient contextual modeling in complex clinical scenarios.

Method: The DTEA model employs two novel modules: Semantic Topology Reconfiguration (STR) for dynamic hypergraph creation, and Entropic Perturbation Gating (EPG) to filter high-entropy channels for spatial attention.

Result: Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate superior segmentation accuracy and generalization of the proposed framework.

Conclusion: The DTEA model successfully addresses challenges in medical image segmentation and outperforms existing methods, enhancing clinical reliability.

Abstract: In medical image segmentation, skip connections are used to merge global
context and reduce the semantic gap between encoder and decoder. Current
methods often struggle with limited structural representation and insufficient
contextual modeling, affecting generalization in complex clinical scenarios. We
propose the DTEA model, featuring a new skip connection framework with the
Semantic Topology Reconfiguration (STR) and Entropic Perturbation Gating (EPG)
modules. STR reorganizes multi-scale semantic features into a dynamic
hypergraph to better model cross-resolution anatomical dependencies, enhancing
structural and semantic representation. EPG assesses channel stability after
perturbation and filters high-entropy channels to emphasize clinically
important regions and improve spatial attention. Extensive experiments on three

TL;DR: The paper introduces an automated framework for detecting and extracting scale bars in SEM images using multi-modal techniques and a Large Language Model (LLM) agent, improving both accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address the inefficiency and inaccuracy of manual scale bar determination in SEM analysis, which is critical for microscopic visualization and analysis.

Method: The framework consists of four stages: i) Automatic Dataset Generation (Auto-DG) for diverse SEM image datasets, ii) object detection for scale bars, iii) hybrid OCR for extracting information using DenseNet and CRNN, and iv) LLM integration for result analysis and validation.

Result: The proposed model achieved impressive results with 100% precision, 95.8% recall, and a 99.2% mAP for object detection at IoU=0.5, as well as 89% precision, 65% recall, and a 75% F1 score for the OCR system, significantly outperforming existing engines.

Conclusion: The study advances scientific imaging by providing an efficient and accurate automated method for SEM scale bar analysis, highlighting the usefulness of LLMs and hybrid techniques for microscopic characterization.

Abstract: Microscopic characterizations, such as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM),
are widely used in scientific research for visualizing and analyzing
microstructures. Determining the scale bars is an important first step of
accurate SEM analysis; however, currently, it mainly relies on manual
operations, which is both time-consuming and prone to errors. To address this
issue, we propose a multi-modal and automated scale bar detection and
extraction framework that provides concurrent object detection, text detection
and text recognition with a Large Language Model (LLM) agent. The proposed
framework operates in four phases; i) Automatic Dataset Generation (Auto-DG)
model to synthesize a diverse dataset of SEM images ensuring robust training
and high generalizability of the model, ii) scale bar object detection, iii)
information extraction using a hybrid Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
system with DenseNet and Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) based
algorithms, iv) an LLM agent to analyze and verify accuracy of the results. The
proposed model demonstrates a strong performance in object detection and
accurate localization with a precision of 100%, recall of 95.8%, and a mean
Average Precision (mAP) of 99.2% at IoU=0.5 and 69.1% at IoU=0.5:0.95. The
hybrid OCR system achieved 89% precision, 65% recall, and a 75% F1 score on the
Auto-DG dataset, significantly outperforming several mainstream standalone
engines, highlighting its reliability for scientific image analysis. The LLM is
introduced as a reasoning engine as well as an intelligent assistant that
suggests follow-up steps and verifies the results. This automated method
powered by an LLM agent significantly enhances the efficiency and accuracy of
scale bar detection and extraction in SEM images, providing a valuable tool for
microscopic analysis and advancing the field of scientific imaging.

TL;DR: The paper presents "Class Vectors," a method for flexible and efficient editing of image classifiers, addressing challenges in forgetting specific classes and adapting to shifts without extensive retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in post hoc editing of pretrained image classifiers, such as extensive retraining costs and limited exploration for image classification adaptations.

Method: The authors introduce Class Vectors, capturing class-specific representation changes in the latent space during fine-tuning, enabling adaptation via steering latent features or mapping vectors into weight space.

Result: Class Vectors effectively capture semantic shifts, support flexible editing through linearity and orthogonality, and demonstrate practical utility in tasks like unlearning, environmental adaptation, and adversarial defense.

Conclusion: Class Vectors enable efficient, flexible, and high-level concept editing for image classifiers, overcoming prior challenges and validating their use across diverse classifiers and applications.

Abstract: Image classifiers play a critical role in detecting diseases in medical
imaging and identifying anomalies in manufacturing processes. However, their
predefined behaviors after extensive training make post hoc model editing
difficult, especially when it comes to forgetting specific classes or adapting
to distribution shifts. Existing classifier editing methods either focus
narrowly on correcting errors or incur extensive retraining costs, creating a
bottleneck for flexible editing. Moreover, such editing has seen limited
investigation in image classification. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce Class Vectors, which capture class-specific representation
adjustments during fine-tuning. Whereas task vectors encode task-level changes
in weight space, Class Vectors disentangle each class's adaptation in the
latent space. We show that Class Vectors capture each class's semantic shift
and that classifier editing can be achieved either by steering latent features
along these vectors or by mapping them into weight space to update the decision
boundaries. We also demonstrate that the inherent linearity and orthogonality
of Class Vectors support efficient, flexible, and high-level concept editing
via simple class arithmetic. Finally, we validate their utility in applications
such as unlearning, environmental adaptation, adversarial defense, and
adversarial trigger optimization.

Method: The model employs three units: Edge-Aware Enhancement Unit (EAEU) for edge clarity, Multi-scale Prompt Generation Unit (MSPGU) for semantic-spatial integration, and Dual-Source Adaptive Gated Fusion Unit (DAGFU) for merging these features.

Result: EEMS demonstrated superior performance and reliability in segmentation tasks when tested on datasets like ISIC2018.

Conclusion: EEMS is a promising, reliable tool for medical image segmentation, offering improved accuracy and robustness for clinical applications.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is vital for diagnosis, treatment planning, and
disease monitoring but is challenged by complex factors like ambiguous edges
and background noise. We introduce EEMS, a new model for segmentation,
combining an Edge-Aware Enhancement Unit (EAEU) and a Multi-scale Prompt
Generation Unit (MSPGU). EAEU enhances edge perception via multi-frequency
feature extraction, accurately defining boundaries. MSPGU integrates high-level
semantic and low-level spatial features using a prompt-guided approach,
ensuring precise target localization. The Dual-Source Adaptive Gated Fusion
Unit (DAGFU) merges edge features from EAEU with semantic features from MSPGU,
enhancing segmentation accuracy and robustness. Tests on datasets like ISIC2018
confirm EEMS's superior performance and reliability as a clinical tool.

### [415] [Human Uncertainty-Aware Data Selection and Automatic Labeling in Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11295)
*Jian Lan,Zhicheng Liu,Udo Schlegel,Raoyuan Zhao,Yihong Liu,Hinrich Schütze,Michael A. Hedderich,Thomas Seidl*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper examines the impact of human uncertainty (HU) on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for vision-language models (VLMs) and proposes a novel framework, HaDola, to better utilize HU for improved performance and calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing reliance on supervised fine-tuning with massive labeled datasets is costly, and real-world datasets often exhibit variations in human confidence (human uncertainty). The aim is to understand the effects of human uncertainty and to develop methods to leverage it effectively, bypassing the typical reliance on frequent labels.

Method: The authors systematically evaluate VLMs under varying HU conditions and introduce HaDola, a framework consisting of four stages: discriminate, self-annotate, error trigger, and training. HaDola bootstraps a small seed set to select informative samples and iteratively refines data selection and labeling.

Result: Experiments on the VQAv2 and VizWiz datasets show that HaDola consistently matches or outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while using less training data. Models trained using HaDola demonstrate superior calibration and accuracy than naive full-dataset training.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling human uncertainty (HU) in supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is more effective than scaling up dataset sizes. The HaDola framework substantially reduces reliance on costly HU annotations while enhancing model accuracy and calibration.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) achieve strong performance in Visual
Question Answering but still rely heavily on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with
massive labeled datasets, which is costly due to human annotations. Crucially,
real-world datasets often exhibit human uncertainty (HU) -- variation in human
confidence across annotations -- but standard SFT simply optimizes toward the
most frequent label, disregarding HU distributions. This leaves two open
questions: How does HU affect SFT, and how can HU be effectively leveraged in
training? In this work, we first conduct a systematic evaluation of VLMs across
varying HU levels. We have two key findings: (i) surprisingly, high-HU samples
contribute little or even degrade model performance, and (ii) naively training
on the full dataset yields under-calibrated models that fail to capture HU
distributions. Motivated by these findings, we introduce HaDola, a human
uncertainty-aware data selection and automatic labeling framework. HaDola
operates in four stages -- discriminate, self-annotate, error trigger, and
training -- to iteratively identify harmful samples, prioritize informative
ones, and bootstrap from a small seed set (5\% of data). Our approach
substantially reduces reliance on costly HU annotations and makes VLMs more
accurate and better calibrated. Extensive experiments on VQAv2 and VizWiz
datasets demonstrate that HaDola consistently matches or outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines with less training data. Our work highlights the
importance of explicitly modeling HU in SFT, suggesting that better utilization
of HU is more effective than merely scaling up dataset size.

### [416] [$Δ\mathrm{Energy}$: Optimizing Energy Change During Vision-Language Alignment Improves both OOD Detection and OOD Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11296)
*Lin Zhu,Yifeng Yang,Xinbing Wang,Qinying Gu,Nanyang Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel OOD score, called ΔEnergy, aimed at enhancing vision-language models (VLMs) for both OOD detection and generalization under various shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge VLMs face when encountering both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data, the paper aims to improve their ability to generalize and detect shifts effectively.

Method: The proposed ΔEnergy score measures energy changes by re-aligning vision-language modalities, and a fine-tuning framework known as EBM is introduced to optimize this score, improving both OOD detection and generalization.

Result: ΔEnergy shows significant improvements in OOD detection benchmarks, outperforming previous methods by 10%-25% in AUROC. EBM yields a domain-consistent Hessian, further enhancing OOD generalization.

Conclusion: The novel ΔEnergy score and unified fine-tuning framework successfully enhance VLMs' robustness, addressing challenges in OOD detection and generalization.

Abstract: Recent approaches for vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable
success in achieving fast downstream adaptation. When applied to real-world
downstream tasks, VLMs inevitably encounter both the in-distribution (ID) data
and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. The OOD datasets often include both
covariate shifts (e.g., known classes with changes in image styles) and
semantic shifts (e.g., test-time unseen classes). This highlights the
importance of improving VLMs' generalization ability to covariate-shifted OOD
data, while effectively detecting open-set semantic-shifted OOD classes. In
this paper, inspired by the substantial energy change observed in closed-set
data when re-aligning vision-language modalities (specifically by directly
reducing the maximum cosine similarity to a low value), we introduce a novel
OOD score, named {\Delta}Energy. {\Delta}Energy significantly outperforms the
vanilla energy-based OOD score and provides a more reliable approach for OOD
detection. Furthermore, {\Delta}Energy can simultaneously improve OOD
generalization under covariate shifts, which is achieved by lower-bound
maximization for {\Delta}Energy (termed EBM). EBM is theoretically proven to
not only enhance OOD detection but also yields a domain-consistent Hessian,
which serves as a strong indicator for OOD generalization. Based on this
finding, we developed a unified fine-tuning framework that allows for improving
VLMs' robustness in both OOD generalization and OOD detection. Extensive
experiments on challenging OOD detection and generalization benchmarks
demonstrate the superiority of our method, outperforming recent approaches by
10% to 25% in AUROC.

### [417] [When Does Supervised Training Pay Off? The Hidden Economics of Object Detection in the Era of Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11302)
*Samer Al-Hamadani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the cost-effectiveness of supervised object detection using YOLO versus zero-shot detection using Vision-Language Models (Gemini Flash 2.5), analyzing their trade-offs in accuracy, deployment volume, and costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to examine the trade-offs between high annotation costs in supervised object detection and reduced accuracy in zero-shot detection to identify cost-effective deployment strategies.

Method: The study uses 1,000 COCO images and 200 diverse product images to compare YOLO and Gemini in terms of accuracy and costs, combined with Total Cost of Ownership modeling and per-detection cost analysis.

Result: Supervised YOLO achieved 91.2% accuracy versus 68.5% for zero-shot Gemini on standard categories but required $10,800 in annotation. Zero-shot Gemini outperformed YOLO on rare product categories with 52.3% accuracy compared to YOLO's 0%. Cost per Correct Detection was significantly lower for Gemini at high inference volumes.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the optimal choice between YOLO and Gemini depends on deployment scale, budget, category stability, and accuracy needs rather than accuracy alone, offering decision frameworks for architecture selection.

Abstract: Object detection systems have traditionally relied on supervised learning
with manually annotated bounding boxes, achieving high accuracy at the cost of
substantial annotation investment. The emergence of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) offers an alternative paradigm enabling zero-shot detection through
natural language queries, eliminating annotation requirements but operating
with reduced accuracy. This paper presents the first comprehensive
cost-effectiveness analysis comparing supervised detection (YOLO) with
zero-shot VLM inference (Gemini Flash 2.5). Through systematic evaluation on
1,000 stratified COCO images and 200 diverse product images spanning consumer
electronics and rare categories, combined with detailed Total Cost of Ownership
modeling, we establish quantitative break-even thresholds governing
architecture selection. Our findings reveal that supervised YOLO achieves 91.2%
accuracy versus 68.5% for zero-shot Gemini on standard categories, representing
a 22.7 percentage point advantage that costs $10,800 in annotation for
100-category systems. However, this advantage justifies investment only beyond
55 million inferences, equivalent to 151,000 images daily for one year.
Zero-shot Gemini demonstrates 52.3% accuracy on diverse product categories
(ranging from highly web-prevalent consumer electronics at 75-85% to rare
specialized equipment at 25-40%) where supervised YOLO achieves 0% due to
architectural constraints preventing detection of untrained classes. Cost per
Correct Detection analysis reveals substantially lower per-detection costs for
Gemini ($0.00050 vs $0.143) at 100,000 inferences despite accuracy deficits. We
develop decision frameworks demonstrating that optimal architecture selection
depends critically on deployment volume, category stability, budget
constraints, and accuracy requirements rather than purely technical performance
metrics.

*Yan Zhou,Mingji Li,Xiantao Zeng,Jie Lin,Yuexia Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Sketch2Symm, a two-stage method for enhancing 3D reconstruction from abstract and sparse sketches by bridging semantics and leveraging symmetry constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sketch-based 3D reconstruction is challenging due to sketches being abstract and sparse, lacking sufficient semantic and geometric information.

Method: Sketch2Symm involves a two-stage process: first, semantic bridging via sketch-to-image translation; second, incorporating symmetry constraints as geometric priors to enrich data.

Result: Experiments on popular sketch datasets show improved performance in metrics like Chamfer Distance, Earth Mover's Distance, and F-Score, validating the method's effectiveness.

Conclusion: Sketch2Symm is an effective approach for sketch-based 3D reconstruction, achieving geometrical consistency and superior performance through semantic enrichment and symmetry constraints.

Abstract: Sketch-based 3D reconstruction remains a challenging task due to the abstract
and sparse nature of sketch inputs, which often lack sufficient semantic and
geometric information. To address this, we propose Sketch2Symm, a two-stage
generation method that produces geometrically consistent 3D shapes from
sketches. Our approach introduces semantic bridging via sketch-to-image
translation to enrich sparse sketch representations, and incorporates symmetry
constraints as geometric priors to leverage the structural regularity commonly
found in everyday objects. Experiments on mainstream sketch datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to existing
sketch-based reconstruction methods in terms of Chamfer Distance, Earth Mover's
Distance, and F-Score, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed semantic
bridging and symmetry-aware design.

*Jean-Paul Travert,Cédric Goeury,Sébastien Boyaval,Vito Bacchi,Fabrice Zaoui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery's preprocessing, flood mapping, and water depth estimation methods on flood events in France. Results emphasize the importance of considering uncertainties across the entire processing pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate flood mapping and water depth estimation are critical for improving the calibration and validation of hydraulic models. This study addresses gaps in understanding how different processing methods impact final outputs.

Method: The study uses SAR imagery to compare various preprocessing, flood mapping, and water depth estimation methods. It evaluates these methods for two flood events in France, employing a pipeline approach and analyzing method and hyperparameter choices.

Result: Choices in speckle noise reduction and flood mapping have significant effects. Supervised approaches generally perform better than unsupervised ones, though tuned unsupervised methods can be comparable. Variations in method configurations heavily influence water depth estimations.

Conclusion: Considering the entire pipeline, from preprocessing to water depth estimation, is necessary for improving results' reliability. Adopting ensemble methods and accounting for methodological uncertainties is recommended to enhance flood assessment outcomes.

Abstract: Flood mapping and water depth estimation from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
imagery are crucial for calibrating and validating hydraulic models. This study
uses SAR imagery to evaluate various preprocessing (especially speckle noise
reduction), flood mapping, and water depth estimation methods. The impact of
the choice of method at different steps and its hyperparameters is studied by
considering an ensemble of preprocessed images, flood maps, and water depth
fields. The evaluation is conducted for two flood events on the Garonne River
(France) in 2019 and 2021, using hydrodynamic simulations and in-situ
observations as reference data. Results show that the choice of speckle filter
alters flood extent estimations with variations of several square kilometers.
Furthermore, the selection and tuning of flood mapping methods also affect
performance. While supervised methods outperformed unsupervised ones, tuned
unsupervised approaches (such as local thresholding or change detection) can
achieve comparable results. The compounded uncertainty from preprocessing and
flood mapping steps also introduces high variability in the water depth field
estimates. This study highlights the importance of considering the entire
processing pipeline, encompassing preprocessing, flood mapping, and water depth
estimation methods and their associated hyperparameters. Rather than relying on
a single configuration, adopting an ensemble approach and accounting for
methodological uncertainty should be privileged. For flood mapping, the method
choice has the most influence. For water depth estimation, the most influential
processing step was the flood map input resulting from the flood mapping step
and the hyperparameters of the methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces InternSVG, a unified framework leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for improved SVG understanding, editing, and generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SVG modeling faces challenges due to fragmented datasets, poor transferability across tasks, and the complexity of handling intricate structures.

Method: The authors propose an integrated framework involving a comprehensive dataset (SAgoge), benchmarking suite (SArena), and a specialized MLLM model (InternSVG) with tailored strategies like SVG-specific tokens and a two-stage training process.

Result: InternSVG exhibits significant improvements in SVG tasks, outperforming leading models on the accompanying SArena benchmark and existing datasets.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that a unified and carefully tailored MLLM approach can lead to substantial advancements in general SVG understanding, editing, and animation.

Abstract: General SVG modeling remains challenging due to fragmented datasets, limited
transferability of methods across tasks, and the difficulty of handling
structural complexity. In response, we leverage the strong transfer and
generalization capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to
achieve unified modeling for SVG understanding, editing, and generation. We
present the InternSVG family, an integrated data-benchmark-model suite. At its
core is SAgoge, the largest and most comprehensive multimodal dataset for SVG
tasks, encompassing both static graphics and dynamic animations. It covers
icons, long-sequence illustrations, scientific diagrams, and dynamic
animations, supporting tasks of varied difficulty levels and providing deeper
hierarchies with richer attributes compared to previous datasets. Based on this
resource, we introduce SArena, a companion benchmark with comprehensive task
definitions and standardized evaluation that aligns with the domains and
difficulty spectrum covered by SAgoge. Building on these foundations, we
propose InternSVG, a unified MLLM for SVG understanding, editing, and
generation with SVG-specific special tokens, subword-based embedding
initialization, and a two-stage training strategy that progresses from short
static SVGs to long-sequence illustrations and complex animations. This unified
formulation induces positive transfer and improves overall performance.
Experiments on SArena and prior benchmark confirm that InternSVG achieves
substantial gains and consistently outperforms leading open and proprietary
counterparts.

*Hai Dang Nguyen,Nguyen Dang Huy Pham,The Minh Duc Nguyen,Dac Thai Nguyen,Hang Thi Nguyen,Duong M. Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MMAP, a framework designed to predict spatial gene expression from histological images with enhanced accuracy, addressing challenges in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There are challenges in accurately predicting spatial gene expression from histological images due to gaps between visual and molecular modalities, and limitations in local and global information integration.

Method: The proposed MMAP framework enhances local feature granularity using multi-magnification patch representations and improves global contextual understanding via latent prototype embeddings.

Result: Experimental results show that MMAP outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in metrics like MAE, MSE, and PCC.

Conclusion: MMAP successfully addresses key challenges in spatial gene expression prediction, providing a more effective solution by integrating local and global features.

Abstract: Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) enables the measurement of gene expression while
preserving spatial information, offering critical insights into tissue
architecture and disease pathology. Recent developments have explored the use
of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained whole-slide images (WSIs) to predict
transcriptome-wide gene expression profiles through deep neural networks. This
task is commonly framed as a regression problem, where each input corresponds
to a localized image patch extracted from the WSI. However, predicting spatial
gene expression from histological images remains a challenging problem due to
the significant modality gap between visual features and molecular signals.
Recent studies have attempted to incorporate both local and global information
into predictive models. Nevertheless, existing methods still suffer from two
key limitations: (1) insufficient granularity in local feature extraction, and
(2) inadequate coverage of global spatial context. In this work, we propose a
novel framework, MMAP (Multi-MAgnification and Prototype-enhanced
architecture), that addresses both challenges simultaneously. To enhance local
feature granularity, MMAP leverages multi-magnification patch representations
that capture fine-grained histological details. To improve global contextual
understanding, it learns a set of latent prototype embeddings that serve as
compact representations of slide-level information. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that MMAP consistently outperforms all existing
state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics, including Mean
Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Pearson Correlation
Coefficient (PCC).

*Joshua Niemeijer,Jan Ehrhardt,Heinz Handels,Hristina Uzunova*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The authors propose a method to incorporate uncertainty and semantic control into ControlNet models. This enables the synthesis of annotated datasets from unlabeled domains, significantly improving downstream segmentation tasks, particularly in cases with domain shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current controlled generative models (like ControlNets) that mainly reproduce the original training distribution, limiting their ability to effectively augment segmentation tasks with domain-shifted data.

Method: The method combines uncertainty control (from unlabeled datasets) and semantic control (from labeled datasets) into a single network. It introduces uncertainty as an indicator that an image falls outside the training distribution and utilizes this to guide the synthesis of annotated data for new domains.

Result: The proposed ControlNet synthesizes annotated data from domains with significant distribution shifts (e.g., low-quality Home-OCT retinal scans), leading to improved segmentation accuracy without additional supervision.

Conclusion: Incorporating uncertainty guidance into ControlNets allows enhanced generality across arbitrary domain shifts and outperforms traditional style transfer methods in handling domain variations.

Abstract: Generative Models are a valuable tool for the controlled creation of
high-quality image data. Controlled diffusion models like the ControlNet have
allowed the creation of labeled distributions. Such synthetic datasets can
augment the original training distribution when discriminative models, like
semantic segmentation, are trained. However, this augmentation effect is
limited since ControlNets tend to reproduce the original training distribution.
  This work introduces a method to utilize data from unlabeled domains to train
ControlNets by introducing the concept of uncertainty into the control
mechanism. The uncertainty indicates that a given image was not part of the
training distribution of a downstream task, e.g., segmentation. Thus, two types
of control are engaged in the final network: an uncertainty control from an
unlabeled dataset and a semantic control from the labeled dataset. The
resulting ControlNet allows us to create annotated data with high uncertainty
from the target domain, i.e., synthetic data from the unlabeled distribution
with labels. In our scenario, we consider retinal OCTs, where typically
high-quality Spectralis images are available with given ground truth
segmentations, enabling the training of segmentation networks. The recent
development in Home-OCT devices, however, yields retinal OCTs with lower
quality and a large domain shift, such that out-of-the-pocket segmentation
networks cannot be applied for this type of data. Synthesizing annotated images
from the Home-OCT domain using the proposed approach closes this gap and leads
to significantly improved segmentation results without adding any further
supervision. The advantage of uncertainty-guidance becomes obvious when
compared to style transfer: it enables arbitrary domain shifts without any
strict learning of an image style. This is also demonstrated in a traffic scene
experiment.

*Shijie Zhao,Xuanyu Zhang,Weiqi Li,Junlin Li,Li Zhang,Tianfan Xue,Jian Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores the reasoning-based image quality assessment (IQA) models trained via reinforcement learning (RL), identifying the mechanisms behind their generalization capabilities and addressing issues of energy usage and latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the mechanisms behind the exceptional generalization of RL-trained IQA models and to overcome their drawbacks in energy efficiency and inference speed.

Method: The study verifies RL's ability to compact redundant visual data into cross-domain aligned text representations for generalization. It proposes RALI, a contrastive learning algorithm that aligns images directly with these text representations, bypassing reasoning processes and LLM loading.

Result: RALI achieves comparable generalization performance to reasoning-based IQA models while using less than 5% of their model parameters and inference time.

Conclusion: RALI provides a solution that maintains performance while significantly reducing computational and energy requirements for IQA tasks, enabling broader applicability in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Reasoning-based image quality assessment (IQA) models trained through
reinforcement learning (RL) exhibit exceptional generalization, yet the
underlying mechanisms and critical factors driving this capability remain
underexplored in current research. Moreover, despite their superior
performance, these models incur inference energy usage and latency orders of
magnitude higher than their earlier counterparts, restricting their deployment
in specific scenarios. Through extensive experiments, this paper verifies and
elaborates that through RL training, MLLMs leverage their reasoning capability
to convert redundant visual representations into compact, cross-domain aligned
text representations. This conversion is precisely the source of the
generalization exhibited by these reasoning-based IQA models. Building on this
fundamental insight, we propose a novel algorithm, RALI, which employs
contrastive learning to directly align images with these generalizable text
representations learned by RL. This approach eliminates the reliance on
reasoning processes and even obviates the need to load an LLM. For the quality
scoring task, this framework achieves generalization performance comparable to
reasoning-based models while requiring less than 5% of their model parameters
and inference time.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces improvements in generating photorealistic reflections and rendering by using a multi-view consistent material inference approach integrated with advanced environment modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance reflections modeling from 2D images for photorealistic rendering by addressing illumination aliasing and lack of generalization in existing methods.

Method: The authors enforce multi-view consistent material inference during deferred shading, track photometric variations to identify reflective regions, and deploy ray tracing for better environment modeling with their system.

Result: The proposed method successfully improves the recovery of both illumination and geometry, achieving state-of-the-art rendering quality on standard benchmarks for novel view synthesis.

Conclusion: Multi-view consistency and robust environment modeling are crucial for realistic reflection rendering, and the proposed advancements demonstrate significant improvements in quality.

Abstract: Modeling reflections from 2D images is essential for photorealistic rendering
and novel view synthesis. Recent approaches enhance Gaussian primitives with
reflection-related material attributes to enable physically based rendering
(PBR) with Gaussian Splatting. However, the material inference often lacks
sufficient constraints, especially under limited environment modeling,
resulting in illumination aliasing and reduced generalization. In this work, we
revisit the problem from a multi-view perspective and show that multi-view
consistent material inference with more physically-based environment modeling
is key to learning accurate reflections with Gaussian Splatting. To this end,
we enforce 2D Gaussians to produce multi-view consistent material maps during
deferred shading. We also track photometric variations across views to identify
highly reflective regions, which serve as strong priors for reflection strength
terms. To handle indirect illumination caused by inter-object occlusions, we
further introduce an environment modeling strategy through ray tracing with
2DGS, enabling photorealistic rendering of indirect radiance. Experiments on
widely used benchmarks show that our method faithfully recovers both
illumination and geometry, achieving state-of-the-art rendering quality in
novel views synthesis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents DocReward, a document reward model for evaluating and improving document structure and style, outperforming baseline models in accuracy and user preference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of attention to visual structure and style in automated document workflows, which affects readability and engagement.

Method: Developed DocReward, a reward model trained on a 117K paired-document dataset (DocPair) using Bradley-Terry loss to evaluate document professionalism regardless of textual quality.

Result: DocReward significantly outperformed GPT-4o and GPT-5 by 30.6 and 19.4 percentage points in evaluation accuracy. It also achieved a higher win rate in document generation evaluation.

Conclusion: DocReward effectively guides automated agents toward creating human-preferred documents, bridging a crucial gap in document structure and style evaluation.

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic workflows have enabled the automation of tasks
such as professional document generation. However, they primarily focus on
textual quality, neglecting visual structure and style, which are crucial for
readability and engagement. This gap arises mainly from the absence of suitable
reward models to guide agentic workflows toward producing documents with
stronger structural and stylistic quality. To address this, we propose
DocReward, a document reward model that evaluates documents based on their
structure and style. We construct a multi-domain dataset DocPair of 117K paired
documents, covering 32 domains and 267 document types, each including a high-
and low-professionalism document with identical content but different structure
and style. This enables the model to evaluate professionalism comprehensively,
and in a textual-quality-agnostic way. DocReward is trained using the
Bradley-Terry loss to score documents, penalizing predictions that contradict
the annotated ranking. To assess the performance of reward models, we create a
test dataset containing document bundles ranked by well-educated human
evaluators. Notably, DocReward outperforms GPT-4o and GPT-5 in accuracy by 30.6
and 19.4 percentage points, respectively, demonstrating its superiority over
baselines. In an extrinsic evaluation of document generation, DocReward
achieves a significantly higher win rate of 60.8%, compared to GPT-5's 37.7%
win rate, demonstrating its utility in guiding generation agents toward
producing human-preferred documents.

TL;DR: This paper introduces an improved framework for establishing object-level correspondence between egocentric and exocentric views using a modified SAM 2 model with a dual-memory architecture and adaptive feature routing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges like extreme viewpoint variations, occlusions, and handling small objects in establishing ego-exo correspondence for intelligent assistants.

Method: The paper proposes enhancements to SAM 2 by integrating a dual-memory system and a Memory-View MoE module that adapts feature contributions and compresses redundant information for long-term memory efficiency.

Result: The proposed LM-EEC method achieves state-of-the-art results on the EgoExo4D benchmark, outperforming existing methods and the SAM 2 baseline.

Conclusion: LM-EEC demonstrates strong generalization across scenarios, resolving SAM 2’s issues in feature fusion and long-term memory limitations, and offering robust solutions for ego-exo correspondence.

Abstract: Establishing object-level correspondence between egocentric and exocentric
views is essential for intelligent assistants to deliver precise and intuitive
visual guidance. However, this task faces numerous challenges, including
extreme viewpoint variations, occlusions, and the presence of small objects.
Existing approaches usually borrow solutions from video object segmentation
models, but still suffer from the aforementioned challenges. Recently, the
Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has shown strong generalization capabilities
and excellent performance in video object segmentation. Yet, when simply
applied to the ego-exo correspondence (EEC) task, SAM 2 encounters severe
difficulties due to ineffective ego-exo feature fusion and limited long-term
memory capacity, especially for long videos. Addressing these problems, we
propose a novel EEC framework based on SAM 2 with long-term memories by
presenting a dual-memory architecture and an adaptive feature routing module
inspired by Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). Compared to SAM 2, our approach features
(i) a Memory-View MoE module which consists of a dual-branch routing mechanism
to adaptively assign contribution weights to each expert feature along both
channel and spatial dimensions, and (ii) a dual-memory bank system with a
simple yet effective compression strategy to retain critical long-term
information while eliminating redundancy. In the extensive experiments on the
challenging EgoExo4D benchmark, our method, dubbed LM-EEC, achieves new
state-of-the-art results and significantly outperforms existing methods and the
SAM 2 baseline, showcasing its strong generalization across diverse scenarios.

Method: The approach involves fusing satellite imagery with AIS data using the YOLO v11 object detection model. An annotated dataset from Lower Mississippi River imagery is used for evaluating vessel-related metrics.

Result: The system achieved high F1 scores in vessel classification (95.8%), barge cover detection (91.6%), operational status classification (99.4%), and directionality accuracy (93.8%). Spatial transferability was up to 98%. Barge count estimation had an MAE of 2.4.

Conclusion: Integrating satellite imagery with AIS improves inland waterway surveillance capabilities and lays groundwork for future multi-modal deep learning applications.

Abstract: Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) for inland waterways remains challenged by
cooperative system vulnerabilities. This paper presents a novel framework that
fuses high-resolution satellite imagery with vessel trajectory data from the
Automatic Identification System (AIS). This work addresses the limitations of
AIS-based monitoring by leveraging non-cooperative satellite imagery and
implementing a fusion approach that links visual detections with AIS data to
identify dark vessels, validate cooperative traffic, and support advanced MDA.
The You Only Look Once (YOLO) v11 object detection model is used to detect and
characterize vessels and barges by vessel type, barge cover, operational
status, barge count, and direction of travel. An annotated data set of 4,550
instances was developed from $5{,}973~\mathrm{mi}^2$ of Lower Mississippi River
imagery. Evaluation on a held-out test set demonstrated vessel classification
(tugboat, crane barge, bulk carrier, cargo ship, and hopper barge) with an F1
score of 95.8\%; barge cover (covered or uncovered) detection yielded an F1
score of 91.6\%; operational status (staged or in motion) classification
reached an F1 score of 99.4\%. Directionality (upstream, downstream) yielded
93.8\% accuracy. The barge count estimation resulted in a mean absolute error
(MAE) of 2.4 barges. Spatial transferability analysis across geographically
disjoint river segments showed accuracy was maintained as high as 98\%. These
results underscore the viability of integrating non-cooperative satellite
sensing with AIS fusion. This approach enables near-real-time fleet
inventories, supports anomaly detection, and generates high-quality data for
inland waterway surveillance. Future work will expand annotated datasets,
incorporate temporal tracking, and explore multi-modal deep learning to further
enhance operational scalability.

### [428] [Coupled Degradation Modeling and Fusion: A VLM-Guided Degradation-Coupled Network for Degradation-Aware Infrared and Visible Image Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11456)
*Tianpei Zhang,Jufeng Zhao,Yiming Zhu,Guangmang Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) under degraded input conditions by proposing VGDCFusion, which integrates degradation modeling with image fusion while utilizing vision-language models for enhanced performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with degraded images by relying on manual pre-processing techniques that decouple degradation handling and fusion, resulting in poor performance.

Method: VGDCFusion combines Specific-Prompt Degradation-Coupled Extractor (SPDCE) for modality-specific degradation awareness and Joint-Prompt Degradation-Coupled Fusion (JPDCF) for cross-modal degradation perception and feature extraction.

Result: Extensive experiments show VGDCFusion significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in degraded image scenarios.

Conclusion: VGDCFusion improves image fusion processes for degraded inputs and demonstrates its superiority over traditional approaches, addressing a critical gap in fusion methodology.

Abstract: Existing Infrared and Visible Image Fusion (IVIF) methods typically assume
high-quality inputs. However, when handing degraded images, these methods
heavily rely on manually switching between different pre-processing techniques.
This decoupling of degradation handling and image fusion leads to significant
performance degradation. In this paper, we propose a novel VLM-Guided
Degradation-Coupled Fusion network (VGDCFusion), which tightly couples
degradation modeling with the fusion process and leverages vision-language
models (VLMs) for degradation-aware perception and guided suppression.
Specifically, the proposed Specific-Prompt Degradation-Coupled Extractor
(SPDCE) enables modality-specific degradation awareness and establishes a joint
modeling of degradation suppression and intra-modal feature extraction. In
parallel, the Joint-Prompt Degradation-Coupled Fusion (JPDCF) facilitates
cross-modal degradation perception and couples residual degradation filtering
with complementary cross-modal feature fusion. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our VGDCFusion significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art fusion approaches under various degraded image scenarios. Our

### [429] [VA-GS: Enhancing the Geometric Representation of Gaussian Splatting via View Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11473)
*Qing Li,Huifang Feng,Xun Gong,Yu-Shen Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to improve surface reconstruction in 3D Gaussian Splatting using view alignment techniques, achieving state-of-the-art results in geometry and novel view synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of 3D Gaussian Splatting in surface reconstruction, as it struggles with accurate geometry and multi-view consistency.

Method: The method improves the geometric representation by incorporating edge-aware image cues, a visibility-aware photometric loss, normal-based constraints, and cross-view consistency through deep feature embeddings.

Result: The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results in surface reconstruction and novel view synthesis on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: The method enhances both geometric accuracy and rendering quality, outperforming previous approaches and contributing to the advancement of 3D Gaussian Splatting techniques.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has recently emerged as an efficient solution for
high-quality and real-time novel view synthesis. However, its capability for
accurate surface reconstruction remains underexplored. Due to the discrete and
unstructured nature of Gaussians, supervision based solely on image rendering
loss often leads to inaccurate geometry and inconsistent multi-view alignment.
In this work, we propose a novel method that enhances the geometric
representation of 3D Gaussians through view alignment (VA). Specifically, we
incorporate edge-aware image cues into the rendering loss to improve surface
boundary delineation. To enforce geometric consistency across views, we
introduce a visibility-aware photometric alignment loss that models occlusions
and encourages accurate spatial relationships among Gaussians. To further
mitigate ambiguities caused by lighting variations, we incorporate normal-based
constraints to refine the spatial orientation of Gaussians and improve local
surface estimation. Additionally, we leverage deep image feature embeddings to
enforce cross-view consistency, enhancing the robustness of the learned
geometry under varying viewpoints and illumination. Extensive experiments on
standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both surface reconstruction and novel view synthesis. The source

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of large cloud-based MLLMs, such as high memory usage, power consumption, and computational needs, making them infeasible for edge devices like mobile phones.

Method: AndesVL models are developed using Qwen3's LLM along with various visual encoders. Detailed architectures, training pipelines, and data are outlined, demonstrating their competitive performance on open-source benchmarks.

Result: AndesVL achieves state-of-the-art performance among models of similar scale in areas such as image-text understanding, reasoning, mathematics, multi-image comprehension, and more.

Conclusion: The paper provides an efficient suite of lightweight MLLMs optimized for mobile devices without compromising competitive performance compared to larger models.

Abstract: In recent years, while cloud-based MLLMs such as QwenVL, InternVL, GPT-4o,
Gemini, and Claude Sonnet have demonstrated outstanding performance with
enormous model sizes reaching hundreds of billions of parameters, they
significantly surpass the limitations in memory, power consumption, and
computing capacity of edge devices such as mobile phones. This paper introduces
AndesVL, a suite of mobile-side MLLMs with 0.6B to 4B parameters based on
Qwen3's LLM and various visual encoders. We comprehensively outline the model
architectures, training pipeline, and training data of AndesVL, which achieves
first-tier performance across a wide range of open-source benchmarks, including
fields such as text-rich image understanding, reasoning and math, multi-image
comprehension, general VQA, hallucination mitigation, multilingual
understanding, and GUI-related tasks when compared with state-of-the-art models
of a similar scale. Furthermore, we introduce a 1+N LoR

### [431] [Towards Fast and Scalable Normal Integration using Continuous Components](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11508)
*Francesco Milano,Jen Jen Chung,Lionel Ott,Roland Siegwart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a faster, more scalable method for surface normal integration by breaking the problem into estimating relative scales of continuous components instead of pixel-level depth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for surface normal integration are slow and poorly scalable for large normal maps due to their reliance on iterative global optimization.

Method: The paper redefines the problem as estimating relative scales of continuous components. The approach uses heuristics for identifying components, rebalances optimization terms, and merges components iteratively to reduce complexity.

Result: State-of-the-art results were achieved on a standard benchmark, with significant speed improvements (up to one order of magnitude) compared to pixel-level approaches.

Conclusion: This novel approach makes surface reconstruction faster and computationally efficient without compromising reconstruction accuracy.

Abstract: Surface normal integration is a fundamental problem in computer vision,
dealing with the objective of reconstructing a surface from its corresponding
normal map. Existing approaches require an iterative global optimization to
jointly estimate the depth of each pixel, which scales poorly to larger normal
maps. In this paper, we address this problem by recasting normal integration as
the estimation of relative scales of continuous components. By constraining
pixels belonging to the same component to jointly vary their scale, we
drastically reduce the number of optimization variables. Our framework includes
a heuristic to accurately estimate continuous components from the start, a
strategy to rebalance optimization terms, and a technique to iteratively merge
components to further reduce the size of the problem. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art results on the standard normal integration benchmark in as
little as a few seconds and achieves one-order-of-magnitude speedup over
pixel-level approaches on large-resolution normal maps.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Situat3DChange, a diverse 3D dataset, and SCReasoner, a method for efficient dynamic scene understanding. These tools address limitations in current 3D benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance comprehension and evaluation in dynamic 3D environments, which existing datasets and methods address only partially.

Method: Developed Situat3DChange, a large-scale dataset of human observations in dynamic scenarios, enriched with LLM-generated insights, paired with SCReasoner for efficient point cloud comparison.

Result: The dataset and SCReasoner demonstrated progress in understanding dynamic scenes, task-agnostic efficacy, and scalability, though limitations in MLLMs remain.

Conclusion: Situat3DChange and SCReasoner contribute significantly to dynamic 3D understanding, showcasing potential for MLLMs in diverse applications while highlighting areas for improvement.

Abstract: Physical environments and circumstances are fundamentally dynamic, yet
current 3D datasets and evaluation benchmarks tend to concentrate on either
dynamic scenarios or dynamic situations in isolation, resulting in incomplete
comprehension. To overcome these constraints, we introduce Situat3DChange, an
extensive dataset supporting three situation-aware change understanding tasks
following the perception-action model: 121K question-answer pairs, 36K change
descriptions for perception tasks, and 17K rearrangement instructions for the
action task. To construct this large-scale dataset, Situat3DChange leverages
11K human observations of environmental changes to establish shared mental
models and shared situational awareness for human-AI collaboration. These
observations, enriched with egocentric and allocentric perspectives as well as
categorical and coordinate spatial relations, are integrated using an LLM to
support understanding of situated changes. To address the challenge of
comparing pairs of point clouds from the same scene with minor changes, we
propose SCReasoner, an efficient 3D MLLM approach that enables effective point
cloud comparison with minimal parameter overhead and no additional tokens
required for the language decoder. Comprehensive evaluation on Situat3DChange
tasks highlights both the progress and limitations of MLLMs in dynamic scene
and situation understanding. Additional experiments on data scaling and
cross-domain transfer demonstrate the task-agnostic effectiveness of using
Situat3DChange as a training dataset for MLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes LikePhys, a method to evaluate intuitive physics in video diffusion models by distinguishing physically valid videos from invalid ones using a new metric, Plausibility Preference Error (PPE).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to improve the evaluation of intuitive physics understanding in video models, which is crucial for creating world simulators but hard due to the challenge of separating physics correctness from visual appearance.

Method: The study introduces a training-free evaluation method, LikePhys, that leverages the denoising objective on a specialized dataset of valid and invalid video pairs. It uses a new metric, PPE, aligned with human perception.

Result: LikePhys outperforms existing evaluation baselines in aligning with human judgment. The benchmark reveals performance variations across physical domains and highlights areas of improvement in current video diffusion models.

Conclusion: Video diffusion models show improving aptitude in intuitive physics with scale but still struggle in handling complex dynamics. LikePhys serves as an effective tool for benchmarking and guiding development in this area.

Abstract: Intuitive physics understanding in video diffusion models plays an essential
role in building general-purpose physically plausible world simulators, yet
accurately evaluating such capacity remains a challenging task due to the
difficulty in disentangling physics correctness from visual appearance in
generation. To the end, we introduce LikePhys, a training-free method that
evaluates intuitive physics in video diffusion models by distinguishing
physically valid and impossible videos using the denoising objective as an
ELBO-based likelihood surrogate on a curated dataset of valid-invalid pairs. By
testing on our constructed benchmark of twelve scenarios spanning over four
physics domains, we show that our evaluation metric, Plausibility Preference
Error (PPE), demonstrates strong alignment with human preference, outperforming
state-of-the-art evaluator baselines. We then systematically benchmark
intuitive physics understanding in current video diffusion models. Our study
further analyses how model design and inference settings affect intuitive
physics understanding and highlights domain-specific capacity variations across
physical laws. Empirical results show that, despite current models struggling
with complex and chaotic dynamics, there is a clear trend of improvement in
physics understanding as model capacity and inference settings scale.

TL;DR: The paper introduces mmWalk, a simulated multi-modal dataset and benchmark aimed at aiding outdoor navigation for the blind or visually impaired (BLV) users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges faced by BLV individuals due to lack of holistic scene understanding in complex outdoor environments.

Method: The authors create mmWalk, a dataset with multi-view sensor data and accessibility-oriented features for safe navigation, alongside a VQA benchmark (mmWalkVQA). They evaluate Vision-Language Models on navigational tasks and fine-tune their model using the dataset.

Result: State-of-the-art Vision-Language Models underperformed on posed risk assessment and navigational tasks. However, mmWalk-finetuned models showed improved performance on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: mmWalk significantly enhances the capability of multi-modal systems in supporting BLV users for safe and informed outdoor navigation.

Abstract: Walking assistance in extreme or complex environments remains a significant
challenge for people with blindness or low vision (BLV), largely due to the
lack of a holistic scene understanding. Motivated by the real-world needs of
the BLV community, we build mmWalk, a simulated multi-modal dataset that
integrates multi-view sensor and accessibility-oriented features for outdoor
safe navigation. Our dataset comprises 120 manually controlled,
scenario-categorized walking trajectories with 62k synchronized frames. It
contains over 559k panoramic images across RGB, depth, and semantic modalities.
Furthermore, to emphasize real-world relevance, each trajectory involves
outdoor corner cases and accessibility-specific landmarks for BLV users.
Additionally, we generate mmWalkVQA, a VQA benchmark with over 69k visual
question-answer triplets across 9 categories tailored for safe and informed
walking assistance. We evaluate state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
using zero- and few-shot settings and found they struggle with our risk
assessment and navigational tasks. We validate our mmWalk-finetuned model on
real-world datasets and show the effectiveness of our dataset for advancing
multi-modal walking assistance.

*Chaofan Gan,Zicheng Zhao,Yuanpeng Tu,Xi Chen,Ziran Qin,Tieyuan Chen,Mehrtash Harandi,Weiyao Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper examines massive activations (MAs) in diffusion transformers (DiTs) for visual generation and proposes a novel self-guidance strategy, Detail Guidance (DG), to enhance fine-detail synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Massive activations in DiTs are observed but not well understood. Investigating their role could help improve detail fidelity in visual generation.

Method: The study investigates the characteristics and impact of massive activations in DiTs. Based on findings, it introduces Detail Guidance (DG), a self-guidance technique to improve fine details by using a degraded model to guide better synthesis.

Result: The proposed DG method improves fine-grained details when applied to pre-trained DiTs like SD3, SD3.5, and Flux, and is compatible with techniques like Classifier-Free Guidance.

Conclusion: Massive activations are crucial for detail generation in DiTs, and exploiting them using the DG strategy significantly enhances visual detail quality in diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently emerged as a powerful backbone
for visual generation. Recent observations reveal \emph{Massive Activations}
(MAs) in their internal feature maps, yet their function remains poorly
understood. In this work, we systematically investigate these activations to
elucidate their role in visual generation. We found that these massive
activations occur across all spatial tokens, and their distribution is
modulated by the input timestep embeddings. Importantly, our investigations
further demonstrate that these massive activations play a key role in local
detail synthesis, while having minimal impact on the overall semantic content
of output. Building on these insights, we propose \textbf{D}etail
\textbf{G}uidance (\textbf{DG}), a MAs-driven, training-free self-guidance
strategy to explicitly enhance local detail fidelity for DiTs. Specifically, DG
constructs a degraded ``detail-deficient'' model by disrupting MAs and
leverages it to guide the original network toward higher-quality detail
synthesis. Our DG can seamlessly integrate with Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG),
enabling further refinements of fine-grained details. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our DG consistently improves fine-grained detail quality
across various pre-trained DiTs (\eg, SD3, SD3.5, and Flux).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper discusses the challenges MLLMs face with omnidirectional images (ODIs), proposes a benchmark called ODI-Bench, and introduces a training-free method (Omni-CoT) to improve comprehension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the lack of exploration into how multimodal large language models (MLLMs) understand immersive environments captured by omnidirectional images (ODIs).

Method: The authors introduce ODI-Bench, a benchmark with 2,000 omnidirectional images and over 4,000 annotated QA pairs for comprehensive evaluation. They also propose Omni-CoT, a training-free approach leveraging chain-of-thought reasoning to improve comprehension.

Result: The study shows that current MLLMs struggle with ODI comprehension. Experiments on 20 models highlight performance gaps, while Omni-CoT improves their ability to process omnidirectional environments.

Conclusion: There is a need for enhanced methods to make MLLMs better at understanding ODIs, and ODI-Bench and Omni-CoT are steps towards that goal.

Abstract: Omnidirectional images (ODIs) provide full 360x180 view which are widely
adopted in VR, AR and embodied intelligence applications. While multi-modal
large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on
conventional 2D image and video understanding benchmarks, their ability to
comprehend the immersive environments captured by ODIs remains largely
unexplored. To address this gap, we first present ODI-Bench, a novel
comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for omnidirectional image
understanding. ODI-Bench contains 2,000 high-quality omnidirectional images and
over 4,000 manually annotated question-answering (QA) pairs across 10
fine-grained tasks, covering both general-level and spatial-level ODI
understanding. Extensive experiments are conducted to benchmark 20
representative MLLMs, including proprietary and open-source models, under both
close-ended and open-ended settings. Experimental results reveal that current
MLLMs still struggle to capture the immersive context provided by ODIs. To this
end, we further introduce Omni-CoT, a training-free method which significantly
enhances MLLMs' comprehension ability in the omnidirectional environment
through chain-of-thought reasoning across both textual information and visual
cues. Both the benchmark and the code will be released upon the publication.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the utility of foundation models in chest X-ray classification, showing that they require fewer labeled examples for high performance and proposing learning curve predictions to save annotation cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chest X-ray classification is resource-intensive due to the need for substantial labeled data, and the paper seeks to assess whether foundation models can reduce this dependency.

Method: The authors evaluate multiple foundation models using power-law fits to predict the number of labeled samples required for specific ROC-AUC thresholds, comparing models like XrayCLIP and XraySigLIP with ResNet-50 baselines.

Result: Foundation models like XrayCLIP and XraySigLIP achieve strong classification performance with significantly fewer labeled examples than ResNet-50. Learning curve slopes from just 50 labeled examples can predict the final performance.

Conclusion: Foundation models reduce the data-labeling burden for chest X-ray classification, and learning curve predictions can aid in optimizing annotation efforts for desired classification performance.

Abstract: Chest X-ray classification is vital yet resource-intensive, typically
demanding extensive annotated data for accurate diagnosis. Foundation models
mitigate this reliance, but how many labeled samples are required remains
unclear. We systematically evaluate the use of power-law fits to predict the
training size necessary for specific ROC-AUC thresholds. Testing multiple
pathologies and foundation models, we find XrayCLIP and XraySigLIP achieve
strong performance with significantly fewer labeled examples than a ResNet-50
baseline. Importantly, learning curve slopes from just 50 labeled cases
accurately forecast final performance plateaus. Our results enable
practitioners to minimize annotation costs by labeling only the essential
samples for targeted performance.

*Aniket Gupta,Hanhui Wang,Charles Saunders,Aruni RoyChowdhury,Hanumant Singh,Huaizu Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SNAP, a universal model for interactive 3D point cloud segmentation that integrates point- and text-based prompts across various domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation was to overcome limitations of current 3D segmentation methods, which are domain-specific, restricted in user interaction types, and suffer from negative transfer when trained on multiple datasets.

Method: SNAP is trained on data from diverse environments (indoor, outdoor, aerial) using domain-adaptive normalization to avoid negative transfer. It employs automatic mask proposal generation and matches them to CLIP text embeddings for segmentation tasks.

Result: SNAP achieved state-of-the-art performance on 8 out of 9 zero-shot segmentation benchmarks and competitive results on all 5 text-prompted benchmarks.

Conclusion: SNAP offers a scalable, generalizable tool for 3D annotation, matching or surpassing domain-specialized methods by integrating both interactive and textual prompts across multiple domains.

Abstract: Interactive 3D point cloud segmentation enables efficient annotation of
complex 3D scenes through user-guided prompts. However, current approaches are
typically restricted in scope to a single domain (indoor or outdoor), and to a
single form of user interaction (either spatial clicks or textual prompts).
Moreover, training on multiple datasets often leads to negative transfer,
resulting in domain-specific tools that lack generalizability. To address these
limitations, we present \textbf{SNAP} (\textbf{S}egment a\textbf{N}ything in
\textbf{A}ny \textbf{P}oint cloud), a unified model for interactive 3D
segmentation that supports both point-based and text-based prompts across
diverse domains. Our approach achieves cross-domain generalizability by
training on 7 datasets spanning indoor, outdoor, and aerial environments, while
employing domain-adaptive normalization to prevent negative transfer. For
text-prompted segmentation, we automatically generate mask proposals without
human intervention and match them against CLIP embeddings of textual queries,
enabling both panoptic and open-vocabulary segmentation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SNAP consistently delivers high-quality segmentation results.
We achieve state-of-the-art performance on 8 out of 9 zero-shot benchmarks for
spatial-prompted segmentation and demonstrate competitive results on all 5
text-prompted benchmarks. These results show that a unified model can match or
exceed specialized domain-specific approaches, providing a practical tool for
scalable 3D annotation. Project page is at, https://neu-vi.github.io/SNAP/

*Denis Zavadski,Damjan Kalšan,Tim Küchler,Haebom Lee,Stefan Roth,Carsten Rother*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a method to adapt synthetic datasets for urban scene recognition to match real domain characteristics using diffusion models, achieving improved segmentation results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current synthetic datasets for urban scene recognition have a significant gap compared to real imagery due to differences in architecture, vegetation, object appearance, and camera characteristics, which reduces effectiveness. Closing this gap traditionally involves costly and time-intensive 3D modeling.

Method: The proposed framework adapts an off-the-shelf diffusion model to the target domain using pseudo-labels to generate high-quality target-aligned images. It uses filtering, rectification, and standardization to make low-effort synthetic data competitive with high-effort synthetic datasets.

Result: Experiments across five synthetic datasets and two real target datasets yielded segmentation improvements of up to +8.0%pt. mIoU compared with state-of-the-art methods, showing the viability of quickly created datasets.

Conclusion: The work introduces a cost-effective, scalable approach to transform lower-effort synthetic datasets into high-quality training data for urban scene understanding, making it comparable to traditionally resource-intensive methods.

Abstract: Synthetic datasets are widely used for training urban scene recognition
models, but even highly realistic renderings show a noticeable gap to real
imagery. This gap is particularly pronounced when adapting to a specific target
domain, such as Cityscapes, where differences in architecture, vegetation,
object appearance, and camera characteristics limit downstream performance.
Closing this gap with more detailed 3D modelling would require expensive asset
and scene design, defeating the purpose of low-cost labelled data. To address
this, we present a new framework that adapts an off-the-shelf diffusion model
to a target domain using only imperfect pseudo-labels. Once trained, it
generates high-fidelity, target-aligned images from semantic maps of any
synthetic dataset, including low-effort sources created in hours rather than
months. The method filters suboptimal generations, rectifies image-label
misalignments, and standardises semantics across datasets, transforming weak
synthetic data into competitive real-domain training sets. Experiments on five
synthetic datasets and two real target datasets show segmentation gains of up
to +8.0%pt. mIoU over state-of-the-art translation methods, making rapidly
constructed synthetic datasets as effective as high-effort, time-intensive
synthetic datasets requiring extensive manual design. This work highlights a
valuable collaborative paradigm where fast semantic prototyping, combined with
generative models, enables scalable, high-quality training data creation for
urban scene understanding.

Motivation: To explore the potential of foundation models in the underutilized area of hyperspectral crop mapping, providing systematic evaluation and identifying areas for improvement.

Method: The study fine-tuned and benchmarked three foundation models using manually labeled training data and tested on an independent region. Performance was assessed with overall accuracy, average accuracy, and F1-score.

Result: The SpectralEarth model performed best with 93.5% accuracy, outperforming HyperSigma (34.5%) and DOFA (62.6%). A compact SpectralEarth variant trained from scratch also showed high performance (91%).

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of model architecture in achieving generalization for hyperspectral crop mapping and provides a benchmark for future model development in this area.

Abstract: Foundation models are transforming Earth observation, but their potential for
hyperspectral crop mapping remains underexplored. This study benchmarks three
foundation models for cereal crop mapping using hyperspectral imagery:
HyperSigma, DOFA, and Vision Transformers pre-trained on the SpectralEarth
dataset (a large multitemporal hyperspectral archive). Models were fine-tuned
on manually labeled data from a training region and evaluated on an independent
test region. Performance was measured with overall accuracy (OA), average
accuracy (AA), and F1-score. HyperSigma achieved an OA of 34.5% (+/- 1.8%),
DOFA reached 62.6% (+/- 3.5%), and the SpectralEarth model achieved an OA of
93.5% (+/- 0.8%). A compact SpectralEarth variant trained from scratch achieved
91%, highlighting the importance of model architecture for strong

### [441] [MS-Mix: Unveiling the Power of Mixup for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11579)
*Hongyu Zhu,Lin Chen,Mounim A. El-Yacoubi,Mingsheng Shang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MS-Mix introduces an emotion-sensitive framework for augmenting multimodal sentiment analysis tasks, outperforming prior methods through adaptive optimizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning models for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis struggle due to the lack of sufficient annotated multimodal data, and traditional Mixup-based augmentation methods face semantic and emotional inconsistencies when applied directly to MSA.

Method: MS-Mix uses three components: (1) a Sentiment-Aware Sample Selection (SASS) to avoid mixing samples with conflicting emotions, (2) a Sentiment Intensity Guided (SIG) module employing multi-head self-attention to compute emotion-based mixing ratios dynamically, and (3) a Sentiment Alignment Loss (SAL) to align cross-modal predictions with additional Kullback-Leibler-based regularization.

Result: MS-Mix demonstrated consistent improvements across six state-of-the-art backbones on three benchmark datasets, surpassing current methods in multimodal sentiment augmentation.

Conclusion: MS-Mix provides a robust and adaptable framework for addressing challenges in multimodal sentiment analysis, establishing it as a new benchmark for future research in this domain.

Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) aims to identify and interpret human
emotions by integrating information from heterogeneous data sources such as
text, video, and audio. While deep learning models have advanced in network
architecture design, they remain heavily limited by scarce multimodal annotated
data. Although Mixup-based augmentation improves generalization in unimodal
tasks, its direct application to MSA introduces critical challenges: random
mixing often amplifies label ambiguity and semantic inconsistency due to the
lack of emotion-aware mixing mechanisms. To overcome these issues, we propose
MS-Mix, an adaptive, emotion-sensitive augmentation framework that
automatically optimizes sample mixing in multimodal settings. The key
components of MS-Mix include: (1) a Sentiment-Aware Sample Selection (SASS)
strategy that effectively prevents semantic confusion caused by mixing samples
with contradictory emotions. (2) a Sentiment Intensity Guided (SIG) module
using multi-head self-attention to compute modality-specific mixing ratios
dynamically based on their respective emotional intensities. (3) a Sentiment
Alignment Loss (SAL) that aligns the prediction distributions across
modalities, and incorporates the Kullback-Leibler-based loss as an additional
regularization term to train the emotion intensity predictor and the backbone
network jointly. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets with six
state-of-the-art backbones confirm that MS-Mix consistently outperforms
existing methods, establishing a new standard for robust multimodal sentiment
augmentation. The source code is available at:

### [442] [ACE-G: Improving Generalization of Scene Coordinate Regression Through Query Pre-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11605)
*Leonard Bruns,Axel Barroso-Laguna,Tommaso Cavallari,Áron Monszpart,Sowmya Munukutla,Victor Adrian Prisacariu,Eric Brachmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ACE-G, a method to improve SCR-based visual relocalization by separating the scene representation from the coordinate regressor. This enables more effective generalization and robustness to varying imaging conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of SCR methods which fail to generalize across varying imaging conditions like lighting and viewpoint changes due to their design of overfitting to training scenes.

Method: They propose separating the coordinate regressor and map representation by introducing a transformer network (for generic learning) and a scene-specific map code. The transformer is pre-trained on diverse scenes and generalized to unseen query images.

Result: The proposed ACE-G method achieves significantly improved robustness to changing imaging conditions on multiple relocalization datasets, while maintaining a low computational footprint.

Conclusion: By decoupling map representation and coordinate regression, ACE-G improves generalization and robustness, overcoming the intrinsic limitations of prior SCR methods.

Abstract: Scene coordinate regression (SCR) has established itself as a promising
learning-based approach to visual relocalization. After mere minutes of
scene-specific training, SCR models estimate camera poses of query images with
high accuracy. Still, SCR methods fall short of the generalization capabilities
of more classical feature-matching approaches. When imaging conditions of query
images, such as lighting or viewpoint, are too different from the training
views, SCR models fail. Failing to generalize is an inherent limitation of
previous SCR frameworks, since their training objective is to encode the
training views in the weights of the coordinate regressor itself. The regressor
essentially overfits to the training views, by design. We propose to separate
the coordinate regressor and the map representation into a generic transformer
and a scene-specific map code. This separation allows us to pre-train the
transformer on tens of thousands of scenes. More importantly, it allows us to
train the transformer to generalize from mapping images to unseen query images
during pre-training. We demonstrate on multiple challenging relocalization
datasets that our method, ACE-G, leads to significantly increased robustness
while keeping the computational footprint attractive.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ExpVid evaluates Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on scientific experiment videos, highlighting their difficulties with fine-grained details and scientific reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to capture the complexity of real laboratory work, especially for MLLMs interpreting experimental procedures.

Method: ExpVid introduces a three-level task hierarchy focusing on Perception, Procedural Understanding, and Scientific Reasoning to systematically evaluate MLLMs. It uses vision-centric annotations validated by experts.

Result: 19 MLLMs were evaluated, showing strong performance in coarse-grained recognition but struggles in fine-grained details, state tracking, and connecting processes to outcomes.

Conclusion: ExpVid serves as a diagnostic tool for MLLMs and provides guidance for their development towards trustworthy scientific experimentation.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold promise for accelerating
scientific discovery by interpreting complex experimental procedures. However,
their true capabilities are poorly understood, as existing benchmarks neglect
the fine-grained and long-horizon nature of authentic laboratory work,
especially in wet-lab settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce ExpVid, the
first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate MLLMs on scientific
experiment videos. Curated from peer-reviewed video publications, ExpVid
features a new three-level task hierarchy that mirrors the scientific process:
(1) Fine-grained Perception of tools, materials, and actions; (2) Procedural
Understanding of step order and completeness; and (3) Scientific Reasoning that
connects the full experiment to its published conclusions. Our vision-centric
annotation pipeline, combining automated generation with multi-disciplinary
expert validation, ensures that tasks require visual grounding. We evaluate 19
leading MLLMs on ExpVid and find that while they excel at coarse-grained
recognition, they struggle with disambiguating fine details, tracking state
changes over time, and linking experimental procedures to scientific outcomes.
Our results reveal a notable performance gap between proprietary and
open-source models, particularly in high-order reasoning. ExpVid not only
provides a diagnostic tool but also charts a roadmap for developing MLLMs
capable of becoming trustworthy partners in scientific experimentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LLF-LUT++, a photo enhancement method that combines global and local operators using Laplacian pyramid decomposition and reconstruction, achieving fast processing and high-quality results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current photo enhancement methods suffer from a trade-off between performance and computational efficiency, which limits their deployment on edge devices or effectiveness in real-world applications.

Method: The proposed LLF-LUT++ integrates an image-adaptive 3D LUT leveraging tonal characteristics of downsampled images, spatial-frequency transformer weight predictors, and local Laplacian filters to improve edge refinement and performance.

Result: LLF-LUT++ demonstrates a 2.64 dB improvement in PSNR on the HDR+ dataset while reducing runtime, processing 4K resolution images in 13 ms on a single GPU, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods across benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed LLF-LUT++ method offers an effective balance of computational efficiency and enhancement performance, making it viable for edge devices and real-world applications.

Abstract: Photo enhancement plays a crucial role in augmenting the visual aesthetics of
a photograph. In recent years, photo enhancement methods have either focused on
enhancement performance, producing powerful models that cannot be deployed on
edge devices, or prioritized computational efficiency, resulting in inadequate
performance for real-world applications. To this end, this paper introduces a
pyramid network called LLF-LUT++, which integrates global and local operators
through closed-form Laplacian pyramid decomposition and reconstruction. This
approach enables fast processing of high-resolution images while also achieving
excellent performance. Specifically, we utilize an image-adaptive 3D LUT that
capitalizes on the global tonal characteristics of downsampled images, while
incorporating two distinct weight fusion strategies to achieve coarse global
image enhancement. To implement this strategy, we designed a spatial-frequency
transformer weight predictor that effectively extracts the desired distinct
weights by leveraging frequency features. Additionally, we apply local
Laplacian filters to adaptively refine edge details in high-frequency
components. After meticulously redesigning the network structure and
transformer model, LLF-LUT++ not only achieves a 2.64 dB improvement in PSNR on
the HDR+ dataset, but also further reduces runtime, with 4K resolution images
processed in just 13 ms on a single GPU. Extensive experimental results on two
benchmark datasets further show that the proposed approach performs favorably
compared to state-of-the-art methods. The source code will be made publicly
available at https://github.com/fengzhang427/LLF-LUT.

*Krittin Chaowakarn,Paramin Sangwongngam,Nang Htet Htet Aung,Chalie Charoenlarpnopparut*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces NV3D, a 3D object detection model for autonomous vehicles that enhances performance by utilizing normal vector features derived from voxel neighborhoods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D object detection methods struggle with feature alignment in multi-modal setups and oversimplified local feature extraction, prompting the introduction of NV3D to address these challenges effectively.

Method: NV3D computes normal vectors for voxels using KNN and PCA, applies sampling strategies to reduce data volume, and uses element-wise attention fusion combining voxel and normal vector features.

Result: NV3D achieves notable improvements on the KITTI dataset, including up to 4.23% higher mAP compared to Voxel R-CNN, even after reducing data volume by 55%.

Conclusion: NV3D introduces a robust approach to 3D object detection, leveraging normal vector features and advanced sampling strategies for high precision and efficient data usage.

Abstract: Recent studies in 3D object detection for autonomous vehicles aim to enrich
features through the utilization of multi-modal setups or the extraction of
local patterns within LiDAR point clouds. However, multi-modal methods face
significant challenges in feature alignment, and gaining features locally can
be oversimplified for complex 3D object detection tasks. In this paper, we
propose a novel model, NV3D, which utilizes local features acquired from voxel
neighbors, as normal vectors computed per voxel basis using K-nearest neighbors
(KNN) and principal component analysis (PCA). This informative feature enables
NV3D to determine the relationship between the surface and pertinent target
entities, including cars, pedestrians, or cyclists. During the normal vector
extraction process, NV3D offers two distinct sampling strategies: normal vector
density-based sampling and FOV-aware bin-based sampling, allowing elimination
of up to 55% of data while maintaining performance. In addition, we applied
element-wise attention fusion, which accepts voxel features as the query and
value and normal vector features as the key, similar to the attention
mechanism. Our method is trained on the KITTI dataset and has demonstrated
superior performance in car and cyclist detection owing to their spatial
shapes. In the validation set, NV3D without sampling achieves 86.60% and 80.18%
mean Average Precision (mAP), greater than the baseline Voxel R-CNN by 2.61%
and 4.23% mAP, respectively. With both samplings, NV3D achieves 85.54% mAP in
car detection, exceeding the baseline by 1.56% mAP, despite roughly 55% of
voxels being filtered out.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IVEBench is a new benchmark designed for assessing instruction-guided video editing, addressing limitations such as limited diversity and incomplete evaluation metrics in existing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video editing benchmarks lack the capability to properly evaluate instruction-guided editing due to issues like limited task diversity, inadequate evaluation metrics, and insufficient source diversity.

Method: IVEBench offers a diverse video database, task categories refined by experts and language models, and a comprehensive evaluation protocol using traditional and multimodal metrics to assess editing quality, compliance, and fidelity.

Result: Tests show IVEBench is effective in benchmarking state-of-the-art video editing methods, yielding human-aligned evaluation outcomes.

Conclusion: IVEBench provides a modern and systematic framework for evaluating instruction-guided video editing, bridging existing gaps in diversity, task coverage, and evaluation comprehensiveness.

Abstract: Instruction-guided video editing has emerged as a rapidly advancing research
direction, offering new opportunities for intuitive content transformation
while also posing significant challenges for systematic evaluation. Existing
video editing benchmarks fail to support the evaluation of instruction-guided
video editing adequately and further suffer from limited source diversity,
narrow task coverage and incomplete evaluation metrics. To address the above
limitations, we introduce IVEBench, a modern benchmark suite specifically
designed for instruction-guided video editing assessment. IVEBench comprises a
diverse database of 600 high-quality source videos, spanning seven semantic
dimensions, and covering video lengths ranging from 32 to 1,024 frames. It
further includes 8 categories of editing tasks with 35 subcategories, whose
prompts are generated and refined through large language models and expert
review. Crucially, IVEBench establishes a three-dimensional evaluation protocol
encompassing video quality, instruction compliance and video fidelity,
integrating both traditional metrics and multimodal large language model-based
assessments. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of IVEBench in
benchmarking state-of-the-art instruction-guided video editing methods, showing
its ability to provide comprehensive and human-aligned evaluation outcomes.

*Pradyumna Yalandur Muralidhar,Yuxuan Xue,Xianghui Xie,Margaret Kostyrko,Gerard Pons-Moll*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhySIC reconstructs metrically accurate human-scene interactions from a single RGB image by addressing depth ambiguities, occlusions, and inconsistent contacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the challenges like depth ambiguity, occlusions, and physically inconsistent contacts in existing methods for reconstructing 3D human-scene interactions.

Method: PhySIC refines coarse estimates of humans and scenes from a single image by incorporating occlusion-aware inpainting, fusion of visible depth, support surface synthesis, and optimization techniques.

Result: PhySIC achieved significant improvements, including a reduction in mean per-vertex scene error from 641 mm to 227 mm, halving PA-MPJPE to 42 mm, and increasing contact F1 from 0.09 to 0.51.

Conclusion: PhySIC advances scalable 3D scene understanding by enabling physically plausible reconstructions of human-scene interactions with enhanced depth alignment, contact accuracy, and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Reconstructing metrically accurate humans and their surrounding scenes from a
single image is crucial for virtual reality, robotics, and comprehensive 3D
scene understanding. However, existing methods struggle with depth ambiguity,
occlusions, and physically inconsistent contacts. To address these challenges,
we introduce PhySIC, a framework for physically plausible Human-Scene
Interaction and Contact reconstruction. PhySIC recovers metrically consistent
SMPL-X human meshes, dense scene surfaces, and vertex-level contact maps within
a shared coordinate frame from a single RGB image. Starting from coarse
monocular depth and body estimates, PhySIC performs occlusion-aware inpainting,
fuses visible depth with unscaled geometry for a robust metric scaffold, and
synthesizes missing support surfaces like floors. A confidence-weighted
optimization refines body pose, camera parameters, and global scale by jointly
enforcing depth alignment, contact priors, interpenetration avoidance, and 2D
reprojection consistency. Explicit occlusion masking safeguards invisible
regions against implausible configurations. PhySIC is efficient, requiring only
9 seconds for joint human-scene optimization and under 27 seconds end-to-end.
It naturally handles multiple humans, enabling reconstruction of diverse
interactions. Empirically, PhySIC outperforms single-image baselines, reducing
mean per-vertex scene error from 641 mm to 227 mm, halving PA-MPJPE to 42 mm,
and improving contact F1 from 0.09 to 0.51. Qualitative results show realistic
foot-floor interactions, natural seating, and plausible reconstructions of
heavily occluded furniture. By converting a single image into a physically
plausible 3D human-scene pair, PhySIC advances scalable 3D scene understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents InfiniHuman, a framework for generating realistic and scalable 3D human avatars using foundation models. It introduces a dataset (111K identities) and a diffusion-based generative pipeline for fine-grained controllability and visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to address the challenge of generating diverse and realistic 3D human avatars without the high costs and limitations associated with capturing and annotating large-scale human datasets.

Method: The approach uses a pipeline (InfiniHumanData) that combines vision-language and image generation models to generate a richly annotated dataset. Based on this, the authors introduced InfiniHumanGen, a diffusion model that generates avatars conditioned on various attributes such as text, body shape, and clothing.

Result: InfiniHuman generated avatars are indistinguishable from scan renderings (per user study). The proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art approaches in controllability, visual quality, and speed.

Conclusion: InfiniHuman provides an affordable, scalable solution for producing high-quality and controllable 3D human avatars. The dataset, pipeline, and generative models will be publicly released to further research and applications.

Abstract: Generating realistic and controllable 3D human avatars is a long-standing
challenge, particularly when covering broad attribute ranges such as ethnicity,
age, clothing styles, and detailed body shapes. Capturing and annotating
large-scale human datasets for training generative models is prohibitively
expensive and limited in scale and diversity. The central question we address
in this paper is: Can existing foundation models be distilled to generate
theoretically unbounded, richly annotated 3D human data? We introduce
InfiniHuman, a framework that synergistically distills these models to produce
richly annotated human data at minimal cost and with theoretically unlimited
scalability. We propose InfiniHumanData, a fully automatic pipeline that
leverages vision-language and image generation models to create a large-scale
multi-modal dataset. User study shows our automatically generated identities
are undistinguishable from scan renderings. InfiniHumanData contains 111K
identities spanning unprecedented diversity. Each identity is annotated with
multi-granularity text descriptions, multi-view RGB images, detailed clothing
images, and SMPL body-shape parameters. Building on this dataset, we propose
InfiniHumanGen, a diffusion-based generative pipeline conditioned on text, body
shape, and clothing assets. InfiniHumanGen enables fast, realistic, and
precisely controllable avatar generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in visual quality,
generation speed, and controllability. Our approach enables high-quality avatar
generation with fine-grained control at effectively unbounded scale through a
practical and affordable solution. We will publicly release the automatic data
generation pipeline, the comprehensive InfiniHumanData dataset, and the
InfiniHumanGen models at https://yuxuan-xue.com/infini-human.

TL;DR: FACE augments NMF with KL divergence regularization to improve alignment between model predictions and concept-based explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of alignment in concept-based explanations with a model's decision-making process, compromising faithfulness.

Method: Proposed a framework that enhances NMF using KL divergence regularization to enforce classifier supervision during concept learning.

Result: Improved faithfulness and sparsity metrics across ImageNet, COCO, and CelebA datasets.

Conclusion: FACE offers a novel approach to generate concept-based explanations that better align with predictive consistency, improving interpretation fidelity.

Abstract: Interpreting deep neural networks through concept-based explanations offers a
bridge between low-level features and high-level human-understandable
semantics. However, existing automatic concept discovery methods often fail to
align these extracted concepts with the model's true decision-making process,
thereby compromising explanation faithfulness. In this work, we propose FACE
(Faithful Automatic Concept Extraction), a novel framework that augments
Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) with a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
regularization term to ensure alignment between the model's original and
concept-based predictions. Unlike prior methods that operate solely on encoder
activations, FACE incorporates classifier supervision during concept learning,
enforcing predictive consistency and enabling faithful explanations. We provide
theoretical guarantees showing that minimizing the KL divergence bounds the
deviation in predictive distributions, thereby promoting faithful local
linearity in the learned concept space. Systematic evaluations on ImageNet,
COCO, and CelebA datasets demonstrate that FACE outperforms existing methods
across faithfulness and sparsity metrics.

*Jinyu Zhang,Haitao Lin,Jiashu Hou,Xiangyang Xue,Yanwei Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified framework for 6D pose, size, and shape estimation of objects using a single RGB-D input, achieving real-time results and strong zero-shot generalization capabilities across diverse categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6D pose estimation is essential in robotics for applications like grasping and manipulation, but existing methods often depend on object-specific priors or fail to generalize well across different categories.

Method: The proposed category-agnostic approach combines dense 2D features with partial 3D point clouds using a Transformer encoder with Mixture-of-Experts and employs parallel decoders for pose-size estimation and shape reconstruction.

Result: Trained on synthetic data from the SOPE dataset, the framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks and exhibits excellent generalization to unseen objects in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework sets a new standard for open-set 6D understanding in robotics and embodied AI, demonstrating its robustness and efficiency in visual object localization.

Abstract: Estimating an object's 6D pose, size, and shape from visual input is a
fundamental problem in computer vision, with critical applications in robotic
grasping and manipulation. Existing methods either rely on object-specific
priors such as CAD models or templates, or suffer from limited generalization
across categories due to pose-shape entanglement and multi-stage pipelines. In
this work, we propose a unified, category-agnostic framework that
simultaneously predicts 6D pose, size, and dense shape from a single RGB-D
image, without requiring templates, CAD models, or category labels at test
time. Our model fuses dense 2D features from vision foundation models with
partial 3D point clouds using a Transformer encoder enhanced by a
Mixture-of-Experts, and employs parallel decoders for pose-size estimation and
shape reconstruction, achieving real-time inference at 28 FPS. Trained solely
on synthetic data from 149 categories in the SOPE dataset, our framework is
evaluated on four diverse benchmarks SOPE, ROPE, ObjaversePose, and HANDAL,
spanning over 300 categories. It achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on seen
categories while demonstrating remarkably strong zero-shot generalization to
unseen real-world objects, establishing a new standard for open-set 6D
understanding in robotics and embodied AI.

*Boyang Zheng,Nanye Ma,Shengbang Tong,Saining Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes replacing standard VAE-based encoders in latent generative modeling with Representation Autoencoders (RAEs) to achieve better reconstructions, semantically rich latent spaces, and scalable architectures. The approach demonstrates strong image generation results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is addressing the limitations of standard VAE encoders in Diffusion Transformers (DiT), such as outdated backbones, low-dimensional latent space, and weak representations that hinder generative quality.

Method: The authors replace VAEs with pretrained representation encoders (e.g., DINO, SigLIP, MAE) paired with trained decoders, forming Representation Autoencoders (RAEs). They analyze challenges of high-dimensional latent spaces, propose solutions, and validate with experiments.

Result: The approach achieves faster convergence without auxiliary representation alignment losses and excellent image generation results on ImageNet, with a best FID score of 1.51 at 256x256 (no guidance) and 1.13 at both 256x256 and 512x512 (with guidance).

Conclusion: RAEs provide clear advantages over standard VAEs, delivering high-quality reconstructions, rich latent spaces, and superior generative performance. They are proposed as the new standard for Diffusion Transformer training.

Abstract: Latent generative modeling, where a pretrained autoencoder maps pixels into a
latent space for the diffusion process, has become the standard strategy for
Diffusion Transformers (DiT); however, the autoencoder component has barely
evolved. Most DiTs continue to rely on the original VAE encoder, which
introduces several limitations: outdated backbones that compromise
architectural simplicity, low-dimensional latent spaces that restrict
information capacity, and weak representations that result from purely
reconstruction-based training and ultimately limit generative quality. In this
work, we explore replacing the VAE with pretrained representation encoders
(e.g., DINO, SigLIP, MAE) paired with trained decoders, forming what we term
Representation Autoencoders (RAEs). These models provide both high-quality
reconstructions and semantically rich latent spaces, while allowing for a
scalable transformer-based architecture. Since these latent spaces are
typically high-dimensional, a key challenge is enabling diffusion transformers
to operate effectively within them. We analyze the sources of this difficulty,
propose theoretically motivated solutions, and validate them empirically. Our
approach achieves faster convergence without auxiliary representation alignment
losses. Using a DiT variant equipped with a lightweight, wide DDT head, we
achieve strong image generation results on ImageNet: 1.51 FID at 256x256 (no
guidance) and 1.13 at both 256x256 and 512x512 (with guidance). RAE offers
clear advantages and should be the new default for diffusion transformer
training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Bayesian topological CNN that integrates topology-aware learning and Bayesian sampling for better image classification performance, especially with limited or corrupted data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNNs have been highly effective in image processing but face issues like overconfidence, requiring large data for training, and poor uncertainty quantification.

Method: The model introduces a topological approach with Bayesian sampling, leveraging manifold information and consistency conditions in the cost function to improve learning of posterior distributions.

Result: The model outperforms standard CNNs, Bayesian neural networks, and topological CNNs on benchmark datasets and enhances uncertainty quantification, especially under limited or corrupted training data conditions.

Conclusion: The novel hybrid method offers a more efficient and robust approach to image classification, suggesting significant advantages in both performance and uncertainty management.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been established as the main
workhorse in image data processing; nonetheless, they require large amounts of
data to train, often produce overconfident predictions, and frequently lack the
ability to quantify the uncertainty of their predictions. To address these
concerns, we propose a new Bayesian topological CNN that promotes a novel
interplay between topology-aware learning and Bayesian sampling. Specifically,
it utilizes information from important manifolds to accelerate training while
reducing calibration error by placing prior distributions on network parameters
and properly learning appropriate posteriors. One important contribution of our
work is the inclusion of a consistency condition in the learning cost, which
can effectively modify the prior distributions to improve the performance of
our novel network architecture. We evaluate the model on benchmark image
classification datasets and demonstrate its superiority over conventional CNNs,
Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), and topological CNNs. In particular, we supply
evidence that our method provides an advantage in situations where training
data is limited or corrupted. Furthermore, we show that the new model allows
for better uncertainty quantification than standard BNNs since it can more
readily identify examples of out-of-distribution data on which it has not been
trained. Our results highlight the potential of our novel hybrid approach for
more efficient and robust image classification.

*Haoran Feng,Dizhe Zhang,Xiangtai Li,Bo Du,Lu Qi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DiT360, a framework for panoramic image generation using hybrid training on perspective and panoramic data, addressing quality challenges through data-centric techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for panoramic image generation face issues with geometric fidelity and photorealism due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality, real-world panoramic datasets.

Method: DiT360 uses inter-domain transformation and intra-domain augmentation modules applied both before and after a VAE model. Techniques include perspective guidance, panoramic refinement, circular padding, yaw loss, and cube loss.

Result: The method demonstrates superior boundary consistency and image fidelity across text-to-panorama, inpainting, and outpainting tasks, validated across eleven quantitative metrics.

Conclusion: DiT360 provides a novel, data-centric approach to panoramic image generation, yielding improvements in generation quality and offering a valuable toolkit for future research.

Abstract: In this work, we propose DiT360, a DiT-based framework that performs hybrid
training on perspective and panoramic data for panoramic image generation. For
the issues of maintaining geometric fidelity and photorealism in generation
quality, we attribute the main reason to the lack of large-scale, high-quality,
real-world panoramic data, where such a data-centric view differs from prior
methods that focus on model design. Basically, DiT360 has several key modules
for inter-domain transformation and intra-domain augmentation, applied at both
the pre-VAE image level and the post-VAE token level. At the image level, we
incorporate cross-domain knowledge through perspective image guidance and
panoramic refinement, which enhance perceptual quality while regularizing
diversity and photorealism. At the token level, hybrid supervision is applied
across multiple modules, which include circular padding for boundary
continuity, yaw loss for rotational robustness, and cube loss for distortion
awareness. Extensive experiments on text-to-panorama, inpainting, and

### [454] [Point Prompting: Counterfactual Tracking with Video Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11715)
*Ayush Shrivastava,Sanyam Mehta,Daniel Geng,Andrew Owens*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that pretrained video diffusion models can enable zero-shot point tracking by prompting them to mark and propagate points visually across frames.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trackers analyze motion, while video generators synthesize it. This paper explores their connection to enable zero-shot tracking without dedicated tracking models.

Method: The authors use colored markers at query points and employ video diffusion models for intermediate noise-level regeneration. A negative prompt ensures the marker's visibility.

Result: The tracking method based on video diffusion models outperforms previous zero-shot approaches and competes with specialized self-supervised models, handling occlusions effectively.

Conclusion: Video diffusion models exhibit emergent capabilities for zero-shot tracking, demonstrating their practical utility beyond synthesis tasks.

Abstract: Trackers and video generators solve closely related problems: the former
analyze motion, while the latter synthesize it. We show that this connection
enables pretrained video diffusion models to perform zero-shot point tracking
by simply prompting them to visually mark points as they move over time. We
place a distinctively colored marker at the query point, then regenerate the
rest of the video from an intermediate noise level. This propagates the marker
across frames, tracing the point's trajectory. To ensure that the marker
remains visible in this counterfactual generation, despite such markers being
unlikely in natural videos, we use the unedited initial frame as a negative
prompt. Through experiments with multiple image-conditioned video diffusion
models, we find that these "emergent" tracks outperform those of prior
zero-shot methods and persist through occlusions, often obtaining performance
that is competitive with specialized self-supervised models.

### [455] [Ev4DGS: Novel-view Rendering of Non-Rigid Objects from Monocular Event Streams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11717)
*Takuya Nakabayashi,Navami Kairanda,Hideo Saito,Vladislav Golyanik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Ev4DGS, a novel approach for rendering views of non-rigidly deforming objects from monocular event cameras without RGB inputs, addressing open challenges in event-based modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for rendering views of non-rigid objects rely on sparse RGB inputs alongside event streams, posing practical limitations. The paper explores if models can be learned solely from event streams.

Method: Ev4DGS creates a deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting representation using a loss that links model outputs with 2D event observations and a coarse 3D deformation model derived from event-based binary masks.

Result: Experimental comparisons on synthetic and real datasets show that Ev4DGS outperforms naive baseline approaches in novel view rendering of non-rigidly deforming objects.

Conclusion: Ev4DGS demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of using only monocular event streams for rendering deforming non-rigid objects, contributing valuable insights to event-based vision research.

Abstract: Event cameras offer various advantages for novel view rendering compared to
synchronously operating RGB cameras, and efficient event-based techniques
supporting rigid scenes have been recently demonstrated in the literature. In
the case of non-rigid objects, however, existing approaches additionally
require sparse RGB inputs, which can be a substantial practical limitation; it
remains unknown if similar models could be learned from event streams only.
This paper sheds light on this challenging open question and introduces Ev4DGS,
i.e., the first approach for novel view rendering of non-rigidly deforming
objects in the explicit observation space (i.e., as RGB or greyscale images)
from monocular event streams. Our method regresses a deformable 3D Gaussian
Splatting representation through 1) a loss relating the outputs of the
estimated model with the 2D event observation space, and 2) a coarse 3D
deformation model trained from binary masks generated from events. We perform
experimental comparisons on existing synthetic and newly recorded real datasets
with non-rigid objects. The results demonstrate the validity of Ev4DGS and its
superior performance compared to multiple naive baselines that can be applied
in our setting. We will release our models and the datasets used in the
evaluation for research purposes; see the project webpage:

*Chengqi Duan,Kaiyue Sun,Rongyao Fang,Manyuan Zhang,Yan Feng,Ying Luo,Yufang Liu,Ke Wang,Peng Pei,Xunliang Cai,Hongsheng Li,Yi Ma,Xihui Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CodePlot-CoT, combining text and visual reasoning for better mathematical problem-solving, supported by a new dataset and benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs and VLMs have limitations in solving math problems that require visual reasoning, such as plotting and auxiliary images.

Method: Developed Math-VR dataset, an image-to-code converter, and trained the CodePlot-CoT model to integrate text and visual reasoning.

Result: CodePlot-CoT significantly improved performance, with up to 21% gain over the base model on a new benchmark.

Conclusion: The research advances multimodal mathematical reasoning and provides resources for community research.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models
(VLMs) have shown significant progress in mathematical reasoning, yet they
still face a critical bottleneck with problems requiring visual assistance,
such as drawing auxiliary lines or plotting functions to solve the problems.
Most LLMs and VLMs are constrained to text-only reasoning chains, while
multimodal unified models that can generate interleaved text and images lack
the necessary precision and controllability for such tasks. To address this, we
propose CodePlot-CoT, a code-driven Chain-of-Thought paradigm for "thinking
with images" in mathematics. Our approach leverages the VLM to generate text
reasoning as well as executable plotting code, which is then rendered into
images as "visual thought", to solve mathematical problems. To achieve this, we
first construct Math-VR, the first large-scale, bilingual dataset and benchmark
for Mathematics problems with Visual Reasoning, comprising 178K samples.
Second, to create high-quality training data, we develop a state-of-the-art
image-to-code converter specialized for parsing complex mathematical figures
into codes. Finally, using these training data, we train the CodePlot-CoT model
for solving mathematical problems. Experimental results show that our model
achieves up to 21% increase over base model on our new benchmark, fully
validating the efficacy of our proposed code-driven reasoning paradigm. Our
work opens a new direction for multimodal mathematical reasoning and provides
the community with the first large-scale dataset, comprehensive benchmark, and
strong approach for such problems. To facilitate future research, we make our
datasets, code, and pretrained models publicly available at
https://github.com/HKU-MMLab/Math-VR-CodePlot-CoT.

*Said Muhammad,Lahlou Laaziz,Nadjia Kara,Phat Tan Nguyen,Timothy Murphy*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces the THEAS algorithm to dynamically adapt resource levels for balancing performance and energy efficiency, particularly in heterogeneous systems with fluctuating workloads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in improving energy efficiency in systems with fluctuating workloads, especially in heterogeneous environments with non-uniform workload distribution.

Method: The study deploys the THEAS algorithm to dynamically balance performance and power consumption, and compares its effectiveness against existing scheduling techniques such as CFS, EAS, HeteroSched, and Utility-Based Scheduling.

Result: The comparative analysis showcases the adaptability, core selection criteria, performance scaling, cache awareness, overhead, and real-time suitability of the THEAS algorithm.

Conclusion: The THEAS algorithm provides a viable solution for real-time applications by efficiently balancing power consumption and performance, demonstrating its advantage over existing scheduling techniques.

Abstract: The dynamic adaptation of resource levels enables the system to enhance
energy efficiency while maintaining the necessary computational resources,
particularly in scenarios where workloads fluctuate significantly over time.
The proposed approach can play a crucial role in heterogeneous systems where
workload characteristics are not uniformly distributed, such as non-pinning
tasks. The deployed THEAS algorithm in this research work ensures a balance
between performance and power consumption, making it suitable for a wide range
of real-time applications. A comparative analysis of the proposed THEAS
algorithm with well-known scheduling techniques such as Completely Fair
Scheduler (CFS), Energy-Aware Scheduling (EAS), Heterogeneous Scheduling
(HeteroSched), and Utility-Based Scheduling is presented in Table III. Each
scheme is compared based on adaptability, core selection criteria, performance
scaling, cache awareness, overhead, and real-time suitability.

*Haci Ismail Aslan,Syed Muhammad Mahmudul Haque,Joel Witzke,Odej Kao*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: QONNECT is a framework that enables QoS-driven, automated application orchestration across heterogeneous Kubernetes and K3s clusters, addressing energy, cost, and performance needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of standard Kubernetes schedulers in meeting global QoS objectives like energy efficiency, cost optimization, and performance across cloud, fog, and edge environments.

Method: QONNECT uses a distributed framework consisting of a central Knowledge Base, Raft-replicated Resource Lead Agents, and lightweight Resource Agents, allowing users to specify QoS goals via YAML. These goals are automatically translated into placement and migration decisions.

Result: The evaluation on a federated testbed of nine clusters demonstrated features like dynamic microservice placement, automated failover, QoS-compliant rescheduling, and leader re-election without manual intervention.

Conclusion: QONNECT provides a unified, self-optimizing platform for cloud-edge continuum management, bridging the gap between declarative deployment models and QoS objectives.

Abstract: Modern applications increasingly span across cloud, fog, and edge
environments, demanding orchestration systems that can adapt to diverse
deployment contexts while meeting Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements.
Standard Kubernetes schedulers do not account for user-defined objectives such
as energy efficiency, cost optimization, and global performance, often leaving
operators to make manual, cluster-by-cluster placement decisions. To address
this need, we present QONNECT, a vendor-agnostic orchestration framework that
enables declarative, QoS-driven application deployment across heterogeneous
Kubernetes and K3s clusters. QONNECT introduces a distributed architecture
composed of a central Knowledge Base, Raft-replicated Resource Lead Agents, and
lightweight Resource Agents in each cluster. Through a minimal YAML-based
interface, users specify high-level QoS goals, which the system translates into
concrete placement and migration actions. Our implementation is evaluated on a
federated testbed of up to nine cloud-fog-edge clusters using the Istio
Bookinfo microservice application. The system demonstrates dynamic,
policy-driven microservice placement, automated failover, QoS-compliant
rescheduling, and leader re-election after node failure, all without manual
intervention. By bridging the gap between declarative deployment models and
operational QoS goals, QONNECT transforms the cloud-edge continuum into a
unified, self-optimizing platform.

### [459] [FedMon: Federated eBPF Monitoring for Distributed Anomaly Detection in Multi-Cluster Cloud Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10126)
*Sehar Zehra,Hassan Jamil Syed,Ummay Faseeha*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper proposes FedMon, a federated eBPF framework that integrates system telemetry with federated learning for multi-cluster anomaly detection, achieving high accuracy and reducing bandwidth demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need for scalable and privacy-preserving anomaly detection across Kubernetes multi-cluster deployments, a challenge unmet by existing eBPF-based monitors or centralized methods.

Method: FedMon employs lightweight eBPF agents to gather local features combined with a global federated learning model. It utilizes Variational Autoencoders and Isolation Forests for anomaly detection.

Result: The proposed system demonstrated high performance, with a precision of 94%, recall of 91%, F1-score of 0.92, and a 60% reduction in bandwidth compared to centralized systems.

Conclusion: FedMon effectively enhances accuracy, scalability, and privacy for securing large multi-cluster cloud-native environments.

Abstract: Kubernetes multi-cluster deployments demand scalable and privacy-preserving
anomaly detection. Existing eBPF-based monitors provide low-overhead system and
network visibility but are limited to single clusters, while centralized
approaches incur bandwidth, privacy, and heterogeneity challenges. We propose
FedMon, a federated eBPF framework that unifies kernel-level telemetry with
federated learning (FL) for cross-cluster anomaly detection. Lightweight eBPF
agents capture syscalls and network events, extract local statistical and
sequence features, and share only model updates with a global server. A hybrid
detection engine combining Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with Isolation
Forests enables both temporal pattern modeling and outlier detection. Deployed
across three Kubernetes clusters, FedMon achieves 94% precision, 91% recall,
and an F1-score of 0.92, while cutting bandwidth usage by 60% relative to
centralized baselines. Results demonstrate that FedMon enhances accuracy,
scalability, and privacy, providing an effective defense for large-scale,
multi-tenant cloud-native environments.

*Suhrid Gupta,Muhammed Tawfiqul Islam,Rajkumar Buyya*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper discusses edge computing, its reliance on microservices for low latency and SLA compliance, and analyzes the challenges in hybrid cloud-edge environments, focusing on auto-scaling algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of maintaining SLA compliance with low latency in hybrid cloud-edge environments using resource scaling.

Method: Overview of edge computing architectures, challenges, Service Level Agreements, and existing auto-scaling algorithms.

Result: The study highlights benefits and limitations of current approaches to ensure SLA compliance in edge computing.

Conclusion: Edge computing with efficient scaling algorithms can ensure SLA compliance but current methods have performance and complexity issues.

Abstract: Edge computing allows for the decentralization of computing resources. This
decentralization is achieved through implementing microservice architectures,
which require low latencies to meet stringent service level agreements (SLA)
such as performance, reliability, and availability metrics. While cloud
computing offers the large data storage and computation resources necessary to
handle peak demands, a hybrid cloud and edge environment is required to ensure
SLA compliance. Several auto-scaling algorithms have been proposed to try to
achieve these compliance challenges, but they suffer from performance issues
and configuration complexity. This chapter provides a brief overview of edge
computing architecture, its uses, benefits, and challenges for resource
scaling. We then introduce Service Level Agreements, and existing research on
devising algorithms used in edge computing environments to meet these
agreements, along with their benefits and drawbacks.

*Liangkun Chen,Zijian Wen,Tian Wu,Xiaoxi Zhang,Chuan Wu*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: SP-MoE enhances Mixture-of-Experts LLMs by introducing speculative expert prefetching and pipelined runtime to address inflated memory and CPU-GPU bandwidth bottlenecks, achieving significant speedups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address computational inefficiencies and memory inflation in integrating Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with speculative decoding in LLMs.

Method: The study introduces speculative expert prefetching, cutoff-layer policies to limit prefetch depth, and pipelined runtime to optimize compute-communication operations.

Result: SP-MoE achieves a remarkable 1.07-3.5x speedup in throughput over existing methods across various settings.

Conclusion: SP-MoE effectively mitigates memory and bandwidth issues, accelerating MoE-based LLM inference without compromising scalability.

Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has been widely adopted in large
language models (LLMs) to reduce computation cost through model sparsity.
Employing speculative decoding (SD) can further accelerate MoE inference by
drafting multiple tokens per step and verifying them in parallel. However,
combining MoE with SD inflates GPU memory and aggravates CPU-GPU bandwidth
contention during multi-token verification. Existing MoE offloading systems are
SD-agnostic and do not address this bottleneck. We present SP-MoE, the first
SD-aware expert-offloading and compute-communication pipelining framework.
SP-MoE introduces: (1) speculative expert prefetching that exploits structural
correspondence between the draft and target models to prefetch likely experts
ahead of verification; (2) a cutoff-layer policy that bounds per-layer prefetch
depth based on empirical profiles and an analytical latency model, guaranteeing
just-in-time availability without overfetch; and (3) a pipelined runtime with
asynchronous prefetch threads and batched I/O to hide loading latency.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that SP-MoE achieves a 1.07-3.5 times TPOT
speedup over state-of-the-art methods across diverse datasets, environments,
and MoE-based models.

### [462] [CPU-Limits kill Performance: Time to rethink Resource Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10747)
*Chirag Shetty,Sarthak Chakraborty,Hubertus Franke,Larisa Shwartz,Chandra Narayanaswami,Indranil Gupta,Saurabh Jha*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The study challenges the necessity of CPU-limits for latency-sensitive applications in cloud-native environments, providing evidence that it may harm application performance and incur higher costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional wisdom in research and industry assumes that CPU-limits are essential for managing application performance and ensuring operational safety; however, real-world user experiences contradict this belief.

Method: The authors empirically analyze the impact of CPU-limits on latency-sensitive applications, questioning the utility of applying this practice broadly.

Result: The findings indicate that CPU-limits can negatively affect latency-sensitive applications, suggesting the need for rethinking auto-scaling and billing paradigms.

Conclusion: The paper advocates for the selective and judicious use of CPU-limits, citing that they can be detrimental in many cases but beneficial for specific scenarios like background jobs.

Abstract: Research in compute resource management for cloud-native applications is
dominated by the problem of setting optimal CPU limits -- a fundamental OS
mechanism that strictly restricts a container's CPU usage to its specified
CPU-limits . Rightsizing and autoscaling works have innovated on
allocation/scaling policies assuming the ubiquity and necessity of CPU-limits .
We question this. Practical experiences of cloud users indicate that CPU-limits
harms application performance and costs more than it helps. These observations
are in contradiction to the conventional wisdom presented in both academic
research and industry best practices. We argue that this indiscriminate
adoption of CPU-limits is driven by erroneous beliefs that CPU-limits is
essential for operational and safety purposes. We provide empirical evidence
making a case for eschewing CPU-limits completely from latency-sensitive
applications. This prompts a fundamental rethinking of auto-scaling and billing
paradigms and opens new research avenues. Finally, we highlight specific
scenarios where CPU-limits can be beneficial if used in a well-reasoned way
(e.g. background jobs).

*Shouxu Lin,Zimeng Pan,Yuhang Yao,Haeyoung Noh,Pei Zhang,Carlee Joe-Wong*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces FLAMMABLE, a framework for Multi-Model Federated Learning (MMFL) designed to address accuracy and training time challenges due to heterogeneity. The proposed method outperforms baselines significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address amplified data, system, and model heterogeneity challenges in Multi-Model Federated Learning (MMFL), which existing and single-model FL solutions fail to handle efficiently.

Method: FLAMMABLE adapts client batch sizes and engages clients to train multiple selected models based on their system capabilities during training rounds. Additionally, the authors developed a benchmarking platform for MMFL evaluation.

Result: FLAMMABLE achieved 1.1-10x improvement in time-to-accuracy performance and 1.3-5.4% higher model accuracy compared to existing baselines across multiple datasets and models.

Conclusion: FLAMMABLE successfully addresses heterogeneity challenges in MMFL, enhances performance, and provides a reproducible benchmark for future research in this area.

Abstract: Multi-Model Federated Learning (MMFL) is an emerging direction in Federated
Learning (FL) where multiple models are trained in parallel, generally on
various datasets. Optimizing the models' accuracies and training times in the
MMFL setting requires adapting to data and system heterogeneity across clients
as in single-model FL; these challenges are amplified in the MMFL setting due
to additional heterogeneity across models. Neither existing solutions nor
na\"ive extensions of single-model FL frameworks efficiently address these
challenges. To bridge this gap, we propose FLAMMABLE, a comprehensive MMFL
training framework. FLAMMABLE optimizes model training by intelligently
adapting client batch sizes while engaging them to train multiple carefully
chosen models, depending on their system capabilities, in each training round.
To evaluate FLAMMABLE, we develop the first benchmark platform for the MMFL
setting, which may enable future reproducible MMFL research. Extensive
evaluations on multiple datasets and models show that FLAMMABLE boosts the MMFL
time-to-accuracy performance by 1.1$\sim$10.0$\times$ while improving the final
model accuracy by 1.3$\sim$5.4\% compared to several known baselines.

*Chenyu Jiang,Zhenkun Cai,Ye Tian,Zhen Jia,Yida Wang,Chuan Wu*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: DCP introduces dynamic context parallelism for training large models, addressing inefficiencies in existing static methods. It shows improved training efficiency under various conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses inefficiencies in static context parallelism during long-context training, specifically dealing with sequence length variability and attention pattern dynamics causing overheads and imbalances.

Method: DCP adopts dynamic, fine-grained blockwise partitioning of both data and computation, allowing flexible mapping of these blocks to devices to optimize resources and reduce overhead.

Result: Micro-benchmark results indicate 1.19x-2.45x acceleration for causal masks and 2.15x-3.77x for sparse patterns, with end-to-end training seeing up to 1.46x speed-up.

Conclusion: DCP effectively mitigates communication overhead and improves memory and computation balance, presenting a practical solution for the challenges in long-context training.

Abstract: Context parallelism has emerged as a key technique to support long-context
training, a growing trend in generative AI for modern large models. However,
existing context parallel methods rely on static parallelization configurations
that overlook the dynamic nature of training data, specifically, the
variability in sequence lengths and token relationships (i.e., attention
patterns) across samples. As a result, these methods often suffer from
unnecessary communication overhead and imbalanced computation. In this paper,
we present DCP, a dynamic context parallel training framework that introduces
fine-grained blockwise partitioning of both data and computation. By enabling
flexible mapping of data and computation blocks to devices, DCP can adapt to
varying sequence characteristics, effectively reducing communication and
improving memory and computation balance. Micro-benchmarks demonstrate that DCP
accelerates attention by 1.19x~2.45x under causal masks and 2.15x~3.77x under
sparse attention patterns. Additionally, we observe up to 0.94x~1.16x
end-to-end training speed-up for causal masks, and 1.00x~1.46x for sparse
masks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a spin-free, kernel-lock-free mutex that ensures FIFO fairness and linearizability via CSP/FDR formal proofs, enhancing coroutine runtimes and inter-process communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address fairness and linearizability challenges in managing shared resources within coroutine runtimes and inter-process communications.

Method: The authors utilize a lock-free queue and validate FIFO fairness and linearizability using CSP/FDR modeling and verification.

Result: The paper demonstrates a claim/release protocol for ProcessJ, ensuring ordered access to shared communication channels with formal proof of fairness and mutex properties.

Conclusion: The proposed protocol successfully manages shared resource access with proven fairness guarantees, making it a robust solution for coroutine and inter-process communication environments.

Abstract: We present the first spin-free, kernel-lock-free mutex that cooperates with
user-mode schedulers and is formally proven FIFO-fair and linearizable using
CSP/FDR. Our fairness oracle and stability-based proof method are reusable
across coroutine runtime designs. We designed the claim/release protocol for a
process-oriented language -- ProcessJ -- to manage the race for claiming shared
inter-process communication channels. Internally, we use a lock-free queue to
park waiting processes for gaining access to a shared object, such as exclusive
access to a shared channel to read from or write to. The queue ensures control
and fairness for processes wishing to access a shared resource, as the protocol
handles claim requests in the order they are inserted into the queue. We
produce CSP models of our protocol and a mutex specification, demonstrating
with FDR that our protocol behaves as a locking mutex.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper proposes using service mesh sidecar proxies as decentralized schedulers in microservice systems to improve scalability and reduce latency in cloud-native environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in centralized scheduling mechanisms for microservices, such as latency, overhead, and fault tolerance issues in large-scale cloud-edge systems.

Method: The method involves embedding lightweight scheduling logic into service mesh sidecar proxies to enable decentralized, in-situ decision-making without central control.

Result: Initial results show scalability potential, with improvements in response time and latency under varying request rates.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a novel architectural direction for decentralized scheduling and provides preliminary evidence of scalability, but does not propose a finalized scheduling algorithm.

Abstract: As microservice-based systems scale across the cloud-edge continuum,
traditional centralized scheduling mechanisms increasingly struggle with
latency, coordination overhead, and fault tolerance. This paper presents a new
architectural direction: leveraging service mesh sidecar proxies as
decentralized, in-situ schedulers to enable scalable, low-latency coordination
in large-scale, cloud-native environments. We propose embedding lightweight,
autonomous scheduling logic into each sidecar, allowing scheduling decisions to
be made locally without centralized control. This approach leverages the
growing maturity of service mesh infrastructures, which support programmable
distributed traffic management. We describe the design of such an architecture
and present initial results demonstrating its scalability potential in terms of
response time and latency under varying request rates. Rather than delivering a
finalized scheduling algorithm, this paper presents a system-level
architectural direction and preliminary evidence to support its scalability
potential.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper explores distributed computing techniques to optimize the usage of large language models (LLMs), with a focus on making them run on consumer-grade computers and comparing state-of-the-art LLM serving methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the computational challenges associated with training, fine-tuning, and inference in LLMs, given their vast scale and resource demands.

Method: The study uses distributed computing techniques, including a novel metaheuristic modification to democratize LLM usage on consumer-grade computers, and conducts a comparative analysis of three modern LLM serving techniques.

Result: The paper achieves insights into scalable distributed computing methods, implements novel modifications for efficiency, and provides a detailed comparative evaluation of LLM serving techniques.

Conclusion: Distributed computing strategies can make large language models more accessible and computationally efficient. The implementation of new methods and a comparative study delivers actionable solutions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) are advanced AI systems trained on extensive
textual data, leveraging deep learning techniques to understand and generate
human-like language. Today's LLMs with billions of parameters are so huge that
hardly any single computing node can train, fine-tune, or infer from them.
Therefore, several distributed computing techniques are being introduced in the
literature to properly utilize LLMs. We have explored the application of
distributed computing techniques in LLMs from two angles.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item We study the techniques that democratize the LLM, that is, how large
models can be run on consumer-grade computers. Here, we also implement a novel
metaheuristics-based modification to an existing system.
  \item We perform a comparative study on three state-of-the-art LLM serving
techniques. \end{itemize}

Result: The proposed AMT algorithm demonstrates an increase in computational performance over the existing method.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the AMT algorithm improves performance by effectively addressing the challenges of scalability and parallelism in $S_N$ transport solvers.

Abstract: Discrete ordinates $S_N$ transport solvers on unstructured meshes pose a
challenge to scale due to complex data dependencies, memory access patterns and
a high-dimensional domain. In this paper, we review the performance bottlenecks
within the shared memory parallelization scheme of an existing transport solver
on modern many-core architectures with high core counts. With this analysis, we
then survey the performance of this solver across a variety of compute
hardware. We then present a new Asynchronous Many-Task (AMT) algorithm for
shared memory parallelism, present results showing an increase in computational
performance over the existing method, and evaluate why performance is improved.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the MWVC problem, important for network monitoring and resource placement, in a decentralized manner due to its NP-hard complexity and real-world applicability.

Method: The paper introduces a decentralized protocol where nodes make local decisions based on neighbor communication. The method is adaptive and reduces communication without relying on central coordination.

Conclusion: The proposed decentralized approach is viable for MWVC computation, balancing solution efficiency and communication cost in practical decentralized environments.

Abstract: We address the problem of computing a Minimum Weighted Vertex Cover (MWVC) in
a decentralized network. MWVC, a classical NP-hard problem, is foundational in
applications such as network monitoring and resource placement. We propose a
fully decentralized protocol where each node makes decisions using only local
knowledge and communicates with its neighbors. The method is adaptive,
communication-efficient, and avoids centralized coordination. We evaluate the
protocol on real-world and synthetic graphs, comparing it to both centralized
and decentralized baselines. Our results demonstrate competitive solution
quality with reduced communication overhead, highlighting the feasibility of
MWVC computation in decentralized environments.

*Mohsen Joneidi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Decomposer Networks, a novel type of semantic autoencoder that breaks inputs into multiple interpretable components using an all-but-one residual update rule and Gauss--Seidel style optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a model that overcomes the limitations of classical autoencoders by providing semantically meaningful factorization of inputs into multiple components.

Method: The proposed Decomposer Networks use N parallel network branches, where each branch operates on a residual input defined as the original signal minus reconstructions from the other branches. This is further differentiated using an unrolled Gauss--Seidel style optimization.

Result: The model enforces explicit competition among components and achieves parsimonious and interpretable representations.

Conclusion: The Decomposer Networks provide a novel framework for semantic encoding, standing out from prior methods by implementing the all-but-one residual modeling approach to factorize inputs effectively.

Abstract: We propose the Decomposer Networks (DecompNet), a semantic autoencoder that
factorizes an input into multiple interpretable components. Unlike classical
autoencoders that compress an input into a single latent representation, the
Decomposer Network maintains N parallel branches, each assigned a residual
input defined as the original signal minus the reconstructions of all other
branches. By unrolling a Gauss--Seidel style block-coordinate descent into a
differentiable network, DecompNet enforce explicit competition among
components, yielding parsimonious, semantically meaningful representations. We
situate our model relative to linear decomposition methods (PCA, NMF), deep
unrolled optimization, and object-centric architectures (MONet, IODINE, Slot
Attention), and highlight its novelty as the first semantic autoencoder to
implement an all-but-one residual update rule.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DRGrad, a framework aimed at addressing task conflicts and negative transfer in multi-task learning for recommendation systems while leveraging personalized information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges posed by negative transfer and the seesaw phenomenon in industrial-scale recommender systems utilizing multi-task learning.

Method: The DRGrad framework includes three components: router, updater, and a personalized gate network, which work together to evaluate and leverage valid gradients during training to minimize task conflicts.

Result: DRGrad outperformed state-of-the-art MTL models on a real-world dataset (15 billion samples) using AUC metrics and effectively managed task conflicts without increasing complexity.

Conclusion: DRGrad successfully mitigates multi-task learning challenges, improves performance on real-world and synthetic datasets, and efficiently routes gradients for diverse correlated tasks.

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) has emerged as a successful strategy in
industrial-scale recommender systems, offering significant advantages such as
capturing diverse users' interests and accurately detecting different behaviors
like ``click" or ``dwell time". However, negative transfer and the seesaw
phenomenon pose challenges to MTL models due to the complex and often
contradictory task correlations in real-world recommendations. To address the
problem while making better use of personalized information, we propose a
personalized Direct Routing Gradient framework (DRGrad), which consists of
three key components: router, updater and personalized gate network. DRGrad
judges the stakes between tasks in the training process, which can leverage all
valid gradients for the respective task to reduce conflicts. We evaluate the
efficiency of DRGrad on complex MTL using a real-world recommendation dataset
with 15 billion samples. The results show that DRGrad's superior performance
over competing state-of-the-art MTL models, especially in terms of AUC (Area
Under the Curve) metrics, indicating that it effectively manages task conflicts
in multi-task learning environments without increasing model complexity, while
also addressing the deficiencies in noise processing. Moreover, experiments on
the public Census-income dataset and Synthetic dataset, have demonstrated the
capability of DRGrad in judging and routing the stakes between tasks with
varying degrees of correlation and personalization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified framework integrating CCTV surveillance and multi-source data to improve real-time urban traffic prediction, achieving high accuracy with practical congestion management applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urbanization has intensified traffic congestion and inefficiencies, highlighting the need for intelligent and adaptive traffic management.

Method: The authors use spatio-temporal feature fusion, Frequent Episode Mining, and a hybrid LSTM-Transformer model, evaluated on the CityFlowV2 dataset.

Result: Achieved 98.46% traffic prediction accuracy, with macro precision of 0.9800, macro recall of 0.9839, and macro F1-score of 0.9819. Significant sequential traffic patterns and alerts were identified.

Conclusion: Video analytics and multi-source data are essential for creating responsive and adaptable intelligent transportation systems that enhance urban mobility.

Abstract: Rapid urbanization has intensified traffic congestion, environmental strain,
and inefficiencies in transportation systems, creating an urgent need for
intelligent and adaptive traffic management solutions. Conventional systems
relying on static signals and manual monitoring are inadequate for the dynamic
nature of modern traffic. This research aims to develop a unified framework
that integrates CCTV surveillance videos with multi-source data descriptors to
enhance real-time urban traffic prediction. The proposed methodology
incorporates spatio-temporal feature fusion, Frequent Episode Mining for
sequential traffic pattern discovery, and a hybrid LSTM-Transformer model for
robust traffic state forecasting. The framework was evaluated on the CityFlowV2
dataset comprising 313,931 annotated bounding boxes across 46 cameras. It
achieved a high prediction accuracy of 98.46 percent, with a macro precision of
0.9800, macro recall of 0.9839, and macro F1-score of 0.9819. FEM analysis
revealed significant sequential patterns such as moderate-congested transitions
with confidence levels exceeding 55 percent. The 46 sustained congestion alerts
are system-generated, which shows practical value for proactive congestion
management. This emphasizes the need for the incorporation of video stream
analytics with data from multiple sources for the design of real-time,
responsive, adaptable multi-level intelligent transportation systems, which
makes urban mobility smarter and safer.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores how reinforcement learning (RL) and supervised learning (SL) shape distinct computational strategies in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for decision-making tasks, showing RL leads to more sophisticated dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the underexplored role of learning paradigms (RL vs SL) in determining the emergent computational dynamics of neural networks.

Method: The authors used dynamical systems analysis to systematically examine the computational architectures and attractor dynamics in RNNs trained with RL and SL on identical tasks.

Result: RL-trained networks exhibit hybrid attractor architectures (fixed points and quasi-periodic attractors) and functionally balanced neural populations, while SL-trained networks predominantly form simpler fixed-point attractors.

Conclusion: The learning algorithm significantly influences emergent computational strategies, with RL leading to complex and robust dynamical mechanisms advantageous in handling challenging tasks.

Abstract: Understanding how learning algorithms shape the computational strategies that
emerge in neural networks remains a fundamental challenge in machine
intelligence. While network architectures receive extensive attention, the role
of the learning paradigm itself in determining emergent dynamics remains
largely unexplored. Here we demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) and
supervised learning (SL) drive recurrent neural networks (RNNs) toward
fundamentally different computational solutions when trained on identical
decision-making tasks. Through systematic dynamical systems analysis, we reveal
that RL spontaneously discovers hybrid attractor architectures, combining
stable fixed-point attractors for decision maintenance with quasi-periodic
attractors for flexible evidence integration. This contrasts sharply with SL,
which converges almost exclusively to simpler fixed-point-only solutions. We
further show that RL sculpts functionally balanced neural populations through a
powerful form of implicit regularization -- a structural signature that
enhances robustness and is conspicuously absent in the more heterogeneous
solutions found by SL-trained networks. The prevalence of these complex
dynamics in RL is controllably modulated by weight initialization and
correlates strongly with performance gains, particularly as task complexity
increases. Our results establish the learning algorithm as a primary
determinant of emergent computation, revealing how reward-based optimization
autonomously discovers sophisticated dynamical mechanisms that are less
accessible to direct gradient-based optimization. These findings provide both
mechanistic insights into neural computation and actionable principles for
designing adaptive AI systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces HA30K, a dataset with 31,000 acoustic materials and their Helmholtz equation solutions. A novel deep learning approach, leveraging Stable Diffusion with ControlNet, enables faster simulations compared to traditional numerical solvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the high computational cost of traditional numerical methods like finite element methods for simulating wave propagation in acoustic materials, especially in large-scale or real-time contexts.

Method: The authors designed a dataset named HA30K to train data-driven models. Their deep learning approach utilizes Stable Diffusion with ControlNet to represent solutions as images, leveraging GPU parallelization for efficient computation.

Result: The method successfully reduces computation time by avoiding explicit equation-solving and employing GPU parallelization to process multiple simulations simultaneously.

Conclusion: Deep learning-based approaches are effective for rapid exploration in scenarios where speed is more critical than accuracy, making them valuable in early-stage research in wave propagation and material design.

Abstract: Accurate simulation of wave propagation in complex acoustic materials is
crucial for applications in sound design, noise control, and material
engineering. Traditional numerical solvers, such as finite element methods, are
computationally expensive, especially when dealing with large-scale or
real-time scenarios. In this work, we introduce a dataset of 31,000 acoustic
materials, named HA30K, designed and simulated solving the Helmholtz equations.
For each material, we provide the geometric configuration and the corresponding
pressure field solution, enabling data-driven approaches to learn Helmholtz
equation solutions. As a baseline, we explore a deep learning approach based on
Stable Diffusion with ControlNet, a state-of-the-art model for image
generation. Unlike classical solvers, our approach leverages GPU
parallelization to process multiple simulations simultaneously, drastically
reducing computation time. By representing solutions as images, we bypass the
need for complex simulation software and explicit equation-solving.
Additionally, the number of diffusion steps can be adjusted at inference time,
balancing speed and quality. We aim to demonstrate that deep learning-based
methods are particularly useful in early-stage research, where rapid
exploration is more critical than absolute accuracy.

*Filippo Rinaldi,Aniello Panariello,Giacomo Salici,Fengyuan Liu,Marco Ciccone,Angelo Porrello,Simone Calderara*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GradFix, a method for transferring task vectors across foundation model versions without full fine-tuning, using gradient sign structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practitioners face inefficiency in redoing fine-tuning tasks on new foundation model releases despite prior work on similar tasks.

Method: The GradFix method identifies the key gradient sign structure. It computes a few gradients on the target model to mask the source task vector and achieve parameter alignment for transfer.

Result: GradFix achieves significant performance improvements on vision and language benchmarks, surpassing naive methods and few-shot fine-tuning.

Conclusion: GradFix is a lightweight and effective approach to adapt task vectors for new model versions, ensuring descent using theoretical and empirical validation.

Abstract: When a new release of a foundation model is published, practitioners
typically need to repeat full fine-tuning, even if the same task has already
been solved in the previous version. A promising alternative is to reuse the
parameter changes (i.e., task vectors) that capture how a model adapts to a
specific task. However, they often fail to transfer across different
pre-trained models due to their misaligned parameter space. In this work, we
show that the key to successful transfer lies in the sign structure of the
gradients of the new model. Based on this insight, we propose GradFix, a novel
method that approximates the ideal gradient sign structure and leverages it to
transfer knowledge using only a handful of labeled samples. Notably, this
requires no additional fine-tuning: the adaptation is achieved by computing a
few gradients at the target model and masking the source task vector
accordingly. This yields an update that is locally aligned with the target loss
landscape, effectively rebasing the task vector onto the new pre-training. We
provide a theoretical guarantee that our method ensures first-order descent.
Empirically, we demonstrate significant performance gains on vision and
language benchmarks, consistently outperforming naive task vector addition and
few-shot fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a point set neural network for particle identification in the NOvA neutrino experiment, which processes sparse 2D detector images and achieves superior accuracy with lower memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the efficiency and accuracy of particle identification in the NOvA neutrino experiment, which traditionally relies on memory-intensive clustering and CNN methods and deals with sparsely represented 2D data.

Method: The authors propose a novel point set neural network that integrates sparse 2D detector data (XZ and YZ views) with operations combining information across these views, optimizing memory usage.

Result: The proposed method uses less than 10% of the memory required by traditional methods and achieves a superior AUC score of 96.8%, compared to 85.4% for independent processing of the views.

Conclusion: The novel neural network approach provides an efficient and more accurate alternative for particle identification in the NOvA neutrino experiment, highlighting its potential for enhancing data analysis in similar scenarios.

Abstract: NOvA is a long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment that detects neutrino
particles from the NuMI beam at Fermilab. Before data from this experiment can
be used in analyses, raw hits in the detector must be matched to their source
particles, and the type of each particle must be identified. This task has
commonly been done using a mix of traditional clustering approaches and
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Due to the construction of the detector,
the data is presented as two sparse 2D images: an XZ and a YZ view of the
detector, rather than a 3D representation. We propose a point set neural
network that operates on the sparse matrices with an operation that mixes
information from both views. Our model uses less than 10% of the memory
required using previous methods while achieving a 96.8% AUC score, a higher
score than obtained when both views are processed independently (85.4%).

*Luca Scimeca,Thomas Jiralerspong,Berton Earnshaw,Jason Hartford,Yoshua Bengio*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method called spectrally anisotropic Gaussian diffusion (SAGD), which improves diffusion probabilistic models by incorporating structured frequency-based biases for better generative modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) by explicitly incorporating inductive biases that align with the target data distribution, which were implicit in previous models.

Method: The method involves introducing an anisotropic noise operator with structured, frequency-diagonal covariance, enabling emphasis or suppression of certain frequency bands while maintaining Gaussian processes. This approach is termed as spectrally anisotropic Gaussian diffusion (SAGD).

Result: The proposed SAGD method outperformed standard diffusion across multiple vision datasets and enabled selective omission by ignoring specific corrupted frequency bands.

Conclusion: The study concludes that using anisotropic forward noise in DPMs provides a simple and principled way to tailor inductive biases, leading to better generative modeling and versatility in handling specific data corruptions.

Abstract: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have achieved strong generative
performance, yet their inductive biases remain largely implicit. In this work,
we aim to build inductive biases into the training and sampling of diffusion
models to better accommodate the target distribution of the data to model. We
introduce an anisotropic noise operator that shapes these biases by replacing
the isotropic forward covariance with a structured, frequency-diagonal
covariance. This operator unifies band-pass masks and power-law weightings,
allowing us to emphasize or suppress designated frequency bands, while keeping
the forward process Gaussian. We refer to this as spectrally anisotropic
Gaussian diffusion (SAGD). In this work, we derive the score relation for
anisotropic covariances and show that, under full support, the learned score
converges to the true data score as $t\!\to\!0$, while anisotropy reshapes the
probability-flow path from noise to data. Empirically, we show the induced
anisotropy outperforms standard diffusion across several vision datasets, and
enables selective omission: learning while ignoring known corruptions confined
to specific bands. Together, these results demonstrate that carefully designed
anisotropic forward noise provides a simple, yet principled, handle to tailor
inductive bias in DPMs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces two new loss functions for modeling EIS data and compares them to existing ones, emphasizing trade-offs between fit quality and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve the efficiency and accuracy of least squares fitting in EIS modeling, which is crucial for data-driven applications with large-scale datasets.

Method: They propose two new loss functions, log-B and log-BW, derived from the Bode representation of EIS, and evaluate their performance using a large generated EIS dataset against multiple quality metrics.

Result: The X2 loss function performed best overall in terms of quality of fit. However, the log-B function provided competitive accuracy while being significantly faster and yielding lower MAPE for most components.

Conclusion: For high-quality fits, X2 is preferred, but for efficiency and slightly lower MAPE in large-scale applications, log-B is a strong alternative.

Abstract: Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data is typically modeled using
an equivalent circuit model (ECM), with parameters obtained by minimizing a
loss function via nonlinear least squares fitting. This paper introduces two
new loss functions, log-B and log-BW, derived from the Bode representation of
EIS. Using a large dataset of generated EIS data, the performance of proposed
loss functions was evaluated alongside existing ones in terms of R2 scores,
chi-squared, computational efficiency, and the mean absolute percentage error
(MAPE) between the predicted component values and the original values.
Statistical comparisons revealed that the choice of loss function impacts
convergence, computational efficiency, quality of fit, and MAPE. Our analysis
showed that X2 loss function (squared sum of residuals with proportional
weighting) achieved the highest performance across multiple quality of fit
metrics, making it the preferred choice when the quality of fit is the primary
goal. On the other hand, log-B offered a slightly lower quality of fit while
being approximately 1.4 times faster and producing lower MAPE for most circuit
components, making log-B as a strong alternative. This is a critical factor for
large-scale least squares fitting in data-driven applications, such as training
machine learning models on extensive datasets or iterations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines the suboptimal performance of isolated training for caching policies and proposes a joint learning approach for cache replacement and prefetching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the inefficiencies caused by isolated training of policies for hardware caching, specifically in cache replacement and prefetching.

Method: The paper introduces shared representations for these policies using a joint encoder and contrastive learning of embeddings.

Result: Preliminary results indicate promising outcomes when the cache replacement and prefetching policies are trained jointly.

Conclusion: Joint training of hardware caching policies can enhance their interdependent performance, and the paper suggests avenues for further exploration in this area.

Abstract: Several learned policies have been proposed to replace heuristics for
scheduling, caching, and other system components in modern systems. By
leveraging diverse features, learning from historical trends, and predicting
future behaviors, such models promise to keep pace with ever-increasing
workload dynamism and continuous hardware evolution. However, policies trained
in isolation may still achieve suboptimal performance when placed together. In
this paper, we inspect one such instance in the domain of hardware caching --
for the policies of cache replacement and prefetching. We argue that these two
policies are bidirectionally interdependent and make the case for training the
two jointly. We propose a joint learning approach based on developing shared
representations for the features used by the two policies. We present two
approaches to develop these shared representations, one based on a joint
encoder and another based on contrastive learning of the embeddings, and
demonstrate promising preliminary results for both of these. Finally, we lay
down an agenda for future research in this direction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel semantic cohesive knowledge distillation scheme, "SODA," to improve deep cross-modal hashing via better multi-label semantic extraction and compatibility with multimodal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing deep supervised cross-modal hashing methods, which fail to effectively integrate multi-label semantics with multimodal data, thereby hindering performance in bridging modality gaps.

Method: The authors propose SODA, which treats multi-label information as a textual modality, incorporates a cross-modal teacher network to distill semantic characteristics, and uses a well-mapped Hamming space as prior knowledge for guiding the cross-modal student network.

Result: Experiments on two benchmark datasets display the superiority of SODA over state-of-the-art deep cross-modal hashing methods.

Conclusion: SODA effectively enhances the compatibility of semantic information with multimodal data by introducing a semantic cohesive knowledge distillation framework, resulting in improved performance on cross-modal retrieval tasks.

Abstract: Recently, deep supervised cross-modal hashing methods have achieve compelling
success by learning semantic information in a self-supervised way. However,
they still suffer from the key limitation that the multi-label semantic
extraction process fail to explicitly interact with raw multimodal data, making
the learned representation-level semantic information not compatible with the
heterogeneous multimodal data and hindering the performance of bridging
modality gap. To address this limitation, in this paper, we propose a novel
semantic cohesive knowledge distillation scheme for deep cross-modal hashing,
dubbed as SODA. Specifically, the multi-label information is introduced as a
new textual modality and reformulated as a set of ground-truth label prompt,
depicting the semantics presented in the image like the text modality. Then, a
cross-modal teacher network is devised to effectively distill cross-modal
semantic characteristics between image and label modalities and thus learn a
well-mapped Hamming space for image modality. In a sense, such Hamming space
can be regarded as a kind of prior knowledge to guide the learning of
cross-modal student network and comprehensively preserve the semantic
similarities between image and text modality. Extensive experiments on two
benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model over the
state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: LMCache introduces an efficient KV caching solution to optimize resource utilization in LLM inference engines, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM inference systems suffer from resource inefficiencies due to independent treatment of engines and queries, highlighting the need for effective KV cache communication and reuse.

Method: LMCache enables KV cache extraction, sharing, offloading, and cross-engine communication through highly optimized data movement, modular connector components, and advanced control APIs.

Result: LMCache, combined with vLLM, boosts throughput by up to 15x across workloads, showing promising adoption in enterprise settings.

Conclusion: LMCache successfully addresses inefficiencies in LLM inference by optimizing KV cache management, paving the way for more effective caching solutions in future systems.

Abstract: Today's LLM inference systems treat individual engines and queries
independently for simplicity, but this causes significant resource
inefficiencies. While there are proposals to avoid redundant computation by
reusing KV caches across queries and to increase GPU utilization by
disaggregating a single query to different engines, their promises cannot be
realized without efficiently offloading and communicating KV cache across LLM
inference engines and queries.
  We present LMCache, the first and so far the most efficient open-source KV
caching solution, which extracts and stores KV caches generated by modern LLM
engines (vLLM and SGLang) and shares the KV caches across engines and queries.
LMCache exposes KV caches in the LLM engine interface, effectively transforming
LLM engines from individual token processors to a collection of engines with KV
cache as the storage and communication medium. In particular, it supports both
cache offloading (prefix reuse across queries) and prefill-decode
disaggregation (cross-engine cache transfer). LMCache's high performance and
wide adoption stem from the following contributions: highly optimized KV cache
data movement with performance optimizations including batched data movement
operations, compute and I/O pipelining; a modular KV cache connector component,
decoupling LMCache from the rapid evolution of inference engines; a first-class
control API, such as pinning, lookup, cleanup, movement, and compression, for
flexible cache orchestration across GPU, CPU, storage, and network layers.
Evaluation shows that combining LMCache with vLLM achieves up to 15x
improvement in throughput across diverse workloads. With a growing community,
LMCache has seen dramatic growth in adoption by enterprise inference systems,
which provides valuable lessons for future KV caching solutions. The source
code of LMCache is at: https://github.com/LMCache/LMCache.

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to reduce the energy and cost overhead of integer rescaling in AI inference by introducing strong quantization for rescale multiplicands and proposing rescale-aware training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Integer rescaling in integer-only AI inference is hardware-intensive and inefficient, even with quantization-aware training (QAT). There is a need to address this issue to enhance energy and cost efficiency in embedded systems.

Method: The authors apply strong quantization to rescale multiplicands post-training and propose "Rescale-Aware Training," a fine-tuning technique for ultra-low bit-width rescaling multiplicands to preserve model quality.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that by reducing rescaler widths up to 8x, the model retains its accuracy with minimal retraining.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enables energy and cost-efficient AI inference, making it more practical for resource-constrained embedded systems, with no compromise on model performance.

Abstract: Integer AI inference significantly reduces computational complexity in
embedded systems. Quantization-aware training (QAT) helps mitigate accuracy
degradation associated with post-training quantization but still overlooks the
impact of integer rescaling during inference, which is a hardware costly
operation in integer-only AI inference. This work shows that rescaling cost can
be dramatically reduced post-training, by applying a stronger quantization to
the rescale multiplicands at no model-quality loss. Furthermore, we introduce
Rescale-Aware Training, a fine tuning method for ultra-low bit-width rescaling
multiplicands. Experiments show that even with 8x reduced rescaler widths, the
full accuracy is preserved through minimal incremental retraining. This enables
more energy-efficient and cost-efficient AI inference for resource-constrained
embedded systems.

TL;DR: This study analyzes spatial uncertainty in wildfire spread forecasting using Earth observation data and introduces a distance metric for practical applications like emergency planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wildfires are becoming more frequent and severe due to climate change, and existing forecasting tools lack the uncertainty quantification needed for effective risk-aware decision-making.

Method: The paper employs multimodal Earth observation inputs and develops a novel distance metric to analyze spatial uncertainty in wildfire spread prediction.

Result: The findings show that predictive uncertainty is spatially structured and concentrated within 20-60 meter buffer zones around fire perimeters, with vegetation health and fire activity being primary uncertainty drivers.

Conclusion: The research enhances wildfire management systems by offering a robust framework for addressing uncertainties, aiding communities in adapting to the increasing wildfire risks associated with climate change.

Abstract: Climate change is intensifying wildfire risks globally, making reliable
forecasting critical for adaptation strategies. While machine learning shows
promise for wildfire prediction from Earth observation data, current approaches
lack uncertainty quantification essential for risk-aware decision making. We
present the first systematic analysis of spatial uncertainty in wildfire spread
forecasting using multimodal Earth observation inputs. We demonstrate that
predictive uncertainty exhibits coherent spatial structure concentrated near
fire perimeters. Our novel distance metric reveals high-uncertainty regions
form consistent 20-60 meter buffer zones around predicted firelines - directly

*Maryam Abdollahi Shamami,Babak Teimourpour,Farshad Sharifi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a machine learning model for predicting drug-drug interactions (DDIs) that is both interpretable and efficient, achieving high predictive accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Drug-drug interactions lead to preventable adverse events, complicating treatments and increasing healthcare costs. Understanding both interacting and non-interacting drugs can improve safety and effectiveness of prescriptions.

Method: The approach combines Mol2Vec and SMILES-BERT embeddings to capture structural and contextual chemical features, integrates a rule-based clinical score (RBScore) to add pharmacological insights, and employs a novel optimization strategy (RSmpl-ACO-PSO) for training a neural classifier.

Result: The model achieved high accuracy on real-world datasets (ROC-AUC 0.911, PR-AUC 0.867 on DrugBank) and generalized well to a clinical Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus cohort. Experiments confirmed the importance of embedding fusion, RBScore, and the optimizer.

Conclusion: The study provides a framework that is reliable, interpretable, and computationally efficient, offering a practical approach to support safer drug therapies and clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are a leading cause of preventable adverse
events, often complicating treatment and increasing healthcare costs. At the
same time, knowing which drugs do not interact is equally important, as such
knowledge supports safer prescriptions and better patient outcomes. In this
study, we propose an interpretable and efficient framework that blends modern
machine learning with domain knowledge to improve DDI prediction. Our approach
combines two complementary molecular embeddings - Mol2Vec, which captures
fragment-level structural patterns, and SMILES-BERT, which learns contextual
chemical features - together with a leakage-free, rule-based clinical score
(RBScore) that injects pharmacological knowledge without relying on interaction
labels. A lightweight neural classifier is then optimized using a novel
three-stage metaheuristic strategy (RSmpl-ACO-PSO), which balances global
exploration and local refinement for stable performance. Experiments on
real-world datasets demonstrate that the model achieves high predictive
accuracy (ROC-AUC 0.911, PR-AUC 0.867 on DrugBank) and generalizes well to a
clinically relevant Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus cohort. Beyond raw performance,
studies show how embedding fusion, RBScore, and the optimizer each contribute
to precision and robustness. Together, these results highlight a practical
pathway for building reliable, interpretable, and computationally efficient
models that can support safer drug therapies and clinical decision-making.

### [486] [Lost in the Middle: An Emergent Property from Information Retrieval Demands in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10276)
*Nikolaus Salvatore,Hao Wang,Qiong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs exhibit reduced performance for information in the middle of long contexts due to positional biases, influenced by training demands, architecture, and attention dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding why LLMs experience a "lost-in-the-middle" phenomenon in context processing and whether it is an inherent flaw or an adaptation to demands.

Method: Training LLM variants (GPT-2 and Llama) on simplified human memory paradigms that simulate short-term and long-term memory demands, analyzing positional bias behavior.

Result: Performance U-shape emerged with primacy and recency effects, linked to training demands, autoregressive properties, and attention sink formation.

Conclusion: Positional biases in LLMs are adaptations influenced by retrieval demands, architecture, and structural attention dynamics during training.

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) often degrades when crucial
information is in the middle of a long context, a "lost-in-the-middle"
phenomenon that mirrors the primacy and recency effects in human memory. We
propose that this behavior is not simply a flaw indicative of information loss
but an adaptation to different information retrieval demands during
pre-training: some tasks require uniform recall across the entire input (a
long-term memory demand), while others prioritize the most recent information
(a short-term memory demand). Consistent with this view, we show that this
U-shaped performance curve emerges when LLMs (GPT-2 and Llama variants) are
trained from scratch on two simple human memory paradigms simulating long-term
and short-term memory demands. Our analysis reveals that while the recency
effect directly aligns with short-term memory demand in the training data, the
primacy effect is induced by the uniform long-term memory demand and is
additionally influenced by the model's autoregressive properties and the
formation of attention sinks. Our main findings from simple human memory
paradigms also generalize to a sequence completion task, which more closely
resembles the next-token prediction process in LLM pre-training. Together, our
findings reveal how information retrieval demands, model architecture, and
structural attention dynamics during model training can jointly produce
positional bias observed in LLMs.

### [487] [Population synthesis with geographic coordinates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09669)
*Jacopo Lenti,Lorenzo Costantini,Ariadna Fosch,Anna Monticelli,David Scala,Marco Pangallo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method using Normalizing Flows (NF) and Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to synthesize georeferenced populations with fine spatial accuracy, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods lack capacity to generate synthetic populations with precise latitude-longitude coordinates due to uneven spatial densities and large empty areas, limiting applications requiring high-detail geography.

Method: The authors use Normalizing Flows to regularize spatial data into latent space and combine it with non-spatial features using a Variational Autoencoder. Spatial autocorrelations are leveraged to learn joint distributions.

Result: The NF+VAE model surpasses benchmarks like copula-based and uniform allocation methods in generating accurate and privacy-preserving synthetic populations, tested across 121 geographical datasets.

Conclusion: This approach enables fine-resolution synthetic population modeling, unlocking possibilities for applications such as disaster response, health modeling, and transportation systems.

Abstract: It is increasingly important to generate synthetic populations with explicit
coordinates rather than coarse geographic areas, yet no established methods
exist to achieve this. One reason is that latitude and longitude differ from
other continuous variables, exhibiting large empty spaces and highly uneven
densities. To address this, we propose a population synthesis algorithm that
first maps spatial coordinates into a more regular latent space using
Normalizing Flows (NF), and then combines them with other features in a
Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to generate synthetic populations. This approach
also learns the joint distribution between spatial and non-spatial features,
exploiting spatial autocorrelations. We demonstrate the method by generating
synthetic homes with the same statistical properties of real homes in 121
datasets, corresponding to diverse geographies. We further propose an
evaluation framework that measures both spatial accuracy and practical utility,
while ensuring privacy preservation. Our results show that the NF+VAE
architecture outperforms popular benchmarks, including copula-based methods and
uniform allocation within geographic areas. The ability to generate geolocated
synthetic populations at fine spatial resolution opens the door to applications
requiring detailed geography, from household responses to floods, to epidemic
spread, evacuation planning, and transport modeling.

### [488] [A physics-aware deep learning model for shear band formation around collapsing pores in shocked reactive materials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09670)
*Xinlun Cheng,Bingzhe Chen,Joseph Choi,Yen T. Nguyen,Pradeep Seshadri,Mayank Verma,H. S. Udaykumar,Stephen Baek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study develops an improved neural network model, PARCv2, to predict shear localization and plastic heating in energetic materials under weak-to-moderate shock conditions, addressing challenges in safety storage and detonation modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring weak-to-moderate shock scenarios is important because they are critical to safe storage and handling of energetic materials but are less studied compared to strong shock conditions.

Method: The paper advances the Physics-Aware Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network (PARCv2) with improved architecture and benchmarks its capabilities against Fourier neural operators and neural ODEs for capturing spatiotemporal shear band dynamics.

Result: PARCv2 outperformed other models (Fourier neural operators and neural ODEs) in predicting spatiotemporal dynamics of shear band formation while exhibiting fewer failure modes.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for domain-specific considerations to develop effective AI-driven simulation tools for reactive materials like energetic materials.

Abstract: Modeling shock-to-detonation phenomena in energetic materials (EMs) requires
capturing complex physical processes such as strong shocks, rapid changes in
microstructural morphology, and nonlinear dynamics of chemical reaction fronts.
These processes participate in energy localization at hotspots, which initiate
chemical energy release leading to detonation. This study addresses the
formation of hotspots in crystalline EMs subjected to weak-to-moderate shock
loading, which, despite its critical relevance to the safe storage and handling
of EMs, remains underexplored compared to the well-studied strong shock
conditions. To overcome the computational challenges associated with direct
numerical simulations, we advance the Physics-Aware Recurrent Convolutional
Neural Network (PARCv2), which has been shown to be capable of predicting
strong shock responses in EMs. We improved the architecture of PARCv2 to
rapidly predict shear localizations and plastic heating, which play important
roles in the weak-to-moderate shock regime. PARCv2 is benchmarked against two
widely used physics-informed models, namely, Fourier neural operator and neural
ordinary differential equation; we demonstrate its superior performance in
capturing the spatiotemporal dynamics of shear band formation. While all models
exhibit certain failure modes, our findings underscore the importance of
domain-specific considerations in developing robust AI-accelerated simulation
tools for reactive materials.

*Shayan Mohajer Hamidi,En-Hui Yang,Ben Liang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces C-DPS, a framework for solving inverse problems by coupling data and measurement-space diffusion, enabling stable sampling without heuristic constraints or likelihood approximations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in solving inverse problems where existing methods struggle with stability and artifacts in complex or high-noise scenarios.

Method: Proposed a new framework, C-DPS, which uses coupled stochastic processes in data and measurement spaces for deriving a closed-form posterior distribution. This eliminates the need for heuristic updates or likelihood approximation.

Result: C-DPS demonstrated superior performance over existing solutions across multiple benchmarks in qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Conclusion: C-DPS simplifies the solution of inverse problems by leveraging coupled stochastic processes, offering an effective and stable approach without artifacts or instability.

Abstract: Inverse problems, where the goal is to recover an unknown signal from noisy
or incomplete measurements, are central to applications in medical imaging,
remote sensing, and computational biology. Diffusion models have recently
emerged as powerful priors for solving such problems. However, existing methods
either rely on projection-based techniques that enforce measurement consistency
through heuristic updates, or they approximate the likelihood $p(\boldsymbol{y}
\mid \boldsymbol{x})$, often resulting in artifacts and instability under
complex or high-noise conditions. To address these limitations, we propose a
novel framework called \emph{coupled data and measurement space diffusion
posterior sampling} (C-DPS), which eliminates the need for constraint tuning or
likelihood approximation. C-DPS introduces a forward stochastic process in the
measurement space $\{\boldsymbol{y}_t\}$, evolving in parallel with the
data-space diffusion $\{\boldsymbol{x}_t\}$, which enables the derivation of a
closed-form posterior $p(\boldsymbol{x}_{t-1} \mid \boldsymbol{x}_t,
\boldsymbol{y}_{t-1})$. This coupling allows for accurate and recursive
sampling based on a well-defined posterior distribution. Empirical results
demonstrate that C-DPS consistently outperforms existing baselines, both
qualitatively and quantitatively, across multiple inverse problem benchmarks.

### [490] [Compositional Symmetry as Compression: Lie Pseudogroup Structure in Algorithmic Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10586)
*Giulio Ruffini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework where agents modeled as neural dynamical systems utilize compositional symmetry and Lie pseudogroups for sensory stream tracking. It introduces symmetry-based constraints and hierarchical reduced manifolds to improve predictive coding efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how compositional structures in natural streams can be utilized by computational agents to improve sensory stream tracking and predictive coding.

Method: The study integrates concepts from generative models, Lie pseudogroups, and neural dynamics to propose structural and dynamical constraints for agents. It uses symmetry principles to reduce complexity in predictive coding by introducing coarse-grained transformations.

Result: The framework aligns symmetry-induced manifolds with compositional factorization, leading to hierarchical structures that reduce dimensionality of predictions and enforce efficient tracking in streams.

Conclusion: Symmetry-driven constraints and compositional principles can simplify and enhance predictive coding models, offering a geometric perspective on efficient sensory stream tracking by agents.

Abstract: In the algorithmic (Kolmogorov) view, agents are programs that track and
compress sensory streams using generative programs. We propose a framework
where the relevant structural prior is simplicity (Solomonoff) understood as
\emph{compositional symmetry}: natural streams are well described by (local)
actions of finite-parameter Lie pseudogroups on geometrically and topologically
complex low-dimensional configuration manifolds (latent spaces). Modeling the
agent as a generic neural dynamical system coupled to such streams, we show
that accurate world-tracking imposes (i) \emph{structural constraints} --
equivariance of the agent's constitutive equations and readouts -- and (ii)
\emph{dynamical constraints}: under static inputs, symmetry induces conserved
quantities (Noether-style labels) in the agent dynamics and confines
trajectories to reduced invariant manifolds; under slow drift, these manifolds
move but remain low-dimensional. This yields a hierarchy of reduced manifolds
aligned with the compositional factorization of the pseudogroup, providing a
geometric account of the ``blessing of compositionality'' in deep models. We
connect these ideas to the Spencer formalism for Lie pseudogroups and formulate
a symmetry-based, self-contained version of predictive coding in which higher
layers receive only \emph{coarse-grained residual transformations}
(prediction-error coordinates) along symmetry directions unresolved at lower
layers.

*Chris Engh,P. M. Aronow*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes leveraging LLM-powered AI tools in double machine learning to improve causal estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of obtaining accurate causal estimates in high-dimensional settings, where traditional methods often struggle due to the curse of dimensionality.

Method: They utilize predictions from generative models trained on historical data as inputs into double machine learning, arguing that these models' historical knowledge and reasoning abilities enhance conditional expectation estimations.

Result: In a case study on online jewelry auctions, the inclusion of LLM-generated predictions improved the efficiency of causal estimation.

Conclusion: The integration of generative model insights into causal inference offers a pathway to more accurate and efficient estimation in high-dimensional contexts.

Abstract: We propose a simple yet effective use of LLM-powered AI tools to improve
causal estimation. In double machine learning, the accuracy of causal estimates
of the effect of a treatment on an outcome in the presence of a
high-dimensional confounder depends on the performance of estimators of
conditional expectation functions. We show that predictions made by generative
models trained on historical data can be used to improve the performance of
these estimators relative to approaches that solely rely on adjusting for
embeddings extracted from these models. We argue that the historical knowledge
and reasoning capacities associated with these generative models can help
overcome curse-of-dimensionality problems in causal inference problems. We
consider a case study using a small dataset of online jewelry auctions, and
demonstrate that inclusion of LLM-generated guesses as predictors can improve
efficiency in estimation.

Result: Provides insights into the characteristics, performance, and effectiveness of ODE- and SDE-based neural network models.

Conclusion: Differential equations offer a promising approach to enhance interpretability and generalization capabilities in deep learning, paving the way for innovative computational methods.

Abstract: Deep learning has become a pivotal technology in fields such as computer
vision, scientific computing, and dynamical systems, significantly advancing
these disciplines. However, neural Networks persistently face challenges
related to theoretical understanding, interpretability, and generalization. To
address these issues, researchers are increasingly adopting a differential

design methodologies for neural networks. In this paper, we provide an
extensive review of deep neural network architectures and dynamic modeling
methods inspired by differential equations. We specifically examine deep neural
network models and deterministic dynamical network constructs based on ordinary
differential equations (ODEs), as well as regularization techniques and
stochastic dynamical network models informed by stochastic differential
equations (SDEs). We present numerical comparisons of these models to
illustrate their characteristics and performance. Finally, we explore promising
research directions in integrating differential equations with deep learning to
offer new insights for developing intelligent computational methods that boast
enhanced interpretability and generalization capabilities.

TL;DR: This paper presents a UAV-based Low-Altitude Economy Network system that enhances real-time multimodal inference through a hierarchical optimization framework, addressing challenges of accuracy and communication efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the challenge of ensuring real-time multimodal inference accuracy and communication efficiency in UAV-enabled low-altitude networks, constrained by limited onboard resources and dynamic conditions.

Method: The paper introduces a UAV-enabled LAENet model and addresses task latency, power consumption, and accuracy constraints through a mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem. The solution involves an Alternating Resolution and Power Optimization (ARPO) algorithm and a Large Language Model-augmented Reinforcement Learning Approach (LLaRA) for trajectory optimization.

Result: The proposed hierarchical optimization framework significantly enhances inference performance and communication efficiency in dynamic LAENet conditions.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that combining resource optimization and LLM-augmented reinforcement learning effectively balances multimodal inference accuracy, latency, and communication efficiency in UAV-enabled networks.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Low-Altitude Economy Networks (LAENets) has enabled
a variety of applications, including aerial surveillance, environmental
sensing, and semantic data collection. To support these scenarios, unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with onboard vision-language models (VLMs)
offer a promising solution for real-time multimodal inference. However,
ensuring both inference accuracy and communication efficiency remains a
significant challenge due to limited onboard resources and dynamic network
conditions. In this paper, we first propose a UAV-enabled LAENet system model
that jointly captures UAV mobility, user-UAV communication, and the onboard
visual question answering (VQA) pipeline. Based on this model, we formulate a
mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem to minimize task latency and
power consumption under user-specific accuracy constraints. To solve the
problem, we design a hierarchical optimization framework composed of two parts:
(i) an Alternating Resolution and Power Optimization (ARPO) algorithm for
resource allocation under accuracy constraints, and (ii) a Large Language
Model-augmented Reinforcement Learning Approach (LLaRA) for adaptive UAV
trajectory optimization. The large language model (LLM) serves as an expert in
refining reward design of reinforcement learning in an offline fashion,
introducing no additional latency in real-time decision-making. Numerical
results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed framework in improving
inference performance and communication efficiency under dynamic LAENet
conditions.

TL;DR: The paper explores neural network plasticity and demonstrates how issues related to critical learning periods and warm-start performance loss can be avoided with adjustments like cyclic learning rate schedules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in training neural networks facing critical learning periods and performance loss from deficit data or warm-starting.

Method: The study replicates key experiments from earlier research, expands their scope, and introduces cyclic learning rate schedules to mitigate issues.

Result: Critical learning problems associated with deficits and warm-starting can be countered by using a cyclic learning rate schedule.

Conclusion: Cyclic learning rate schedules offer practical solutions to avoid critical learning period deficiencies and warm-starting performance loss in neural networks.

Abstract: This study delves into the plasticity of neural networks, offering empirical
support for the notion that critical learning periods and warm-starting
performance loss can be avoided through simple adjustments to learning
hyperparameters. The critical learning phenomenon emerges when training is
initiated with deficit data. Subsequently, after numerous deficit epochs, the
network's plasticity wanes, impeding its capacity to achieve parity in accuracy
with models trained from scratch, even when extensive clean data training
follows deficit epochs. Building upon seminal research introducing critical
learning periods, we replicate key findings and broaden the experimental scope
of the main experiment from the original work. In addition, we consider a
warm-starting approach and show that it can be seen as a form of deficit
pretraining. In particular, we demonstrate that these problems can be averted
by employing a cyclic learning rate schedule. Our findings not only impact
neural network training practices but also establish a vital link between
critical learning periods and ongoing research on warm-starting neural network
training.

*Tejash Varsani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores improvements in federated learning's privacy via differential privacy, specifically adaptive privacy budgets and adaptive clipping, showing promising results in maintaining accuracy while preserving privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Protecting data privacy in federated learning is essential as risks persist despite advancements. Fixed privacy budgets in differential privacy methods lead to excessive noise, especially during model convergence, lowering performance.

Method: The authors use Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms with adaptive privacy budgets in differential privacy, extending the SelecEval simulator. They introduce adaptive clipping in the Gaussian mechanism to dynamically adjust gradient sensitivity and conduct experiments across dataset configurations and selected clients.

Result: Experiments on various settings show that adaptive privacy budgets and adaptive clipping help maintain model accuracy, even under privacy constraints, suggesting their practical potential.

Conclusion: Adaptive mechanisms for privacy budgets and clipping improve differential privacy's balance between preserving data privacy and maintaining model performance in federated learning settings.

Abstract: Federated learning is distributed model training across several clients
without disclosing raw data. Despite advancements in data privacy, risks still
remain. Differential Privacy (DP) is a technique to protect sensitive data by
adding noise to model updates, usually controlled by a fixed privacy budget.
However, this approach can introduce excessive noise, particularly when the
model converges, which compromises performance. To address this problem,
adaptive privacy budgets have been investigated as a potential solution. This
work implements DP methods using Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms with an
adaptive privacy budget, extending the SelecEval simulator. We introduce an
adaptive clipping approach in the Gaussian mechanism, ensuring that gradients
of the model are dynamically updated rather than using a fixed sensitivity. We
conduct extensive experiments with various privacy budgets, IID and non-IID
datasets, and different numbers of selected clients per round. While our
experiments were limited to 200 training rounds, the results suggest that
adaptive privacy budgets and adaptive clipping can help maintain model accuracy
while preserving privacy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework that models task relationships through a Gaussian Markov Random Field with an unknown precision matrix, enabling agents in federated and decentralized learning to optimize local models adaptively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical federated and decentralized learning approaches are inefficient when handling heterogeneous local data or task distributions, necessitating strategies that can adapt to local variations.

Method: The authors propose an algorithm that captures task relationships using a Gaussian Markov Random Field and simultaneously learns these relationships alongside optimizing local models.

Result: Their theoretical analysis demonstrates the quality of learned relationships, and numerical experiments validate its applicability and effectiveness.

Conclusion: The framework allows agents to self-organize in alignment with their data distributions, overcoming the limitations of classical consensus-based methods.

Abstract: Classical consensus-based strategies for federated and decentralized learning
are statistically suboptimal in the presence of heterogeneous local data or
task distributions. As a result, in recent years, there has been growing
interest in multitask or personalized strategies, which allow individual agents
to benefit from one another in pursuing locally optimal models without
enforcing consensus. Existing strategies require either precise prior knowledge
of the underlying task relationships or are fully non-parametric and instead
rely on meta-learning or proximal constructions. In this work, we introduce an
algorithmic framework that strikes a balance between these extremes. By
modeling task relationships through a Gaussian Markov Random Field with an
unknown precision matrix, we develop a strategy that jointly learns both the
task relationships and the local models, allowing agents to self-organize in a
way consistent with their individual data distributions. Our theoretical
analysis quantifies the quality of the learned relationship, and our numerical
experiments demonstrate its practical effectiveness.

TL;DR: This paper compares three mesh-free neural PDE solvers—PINNs, DRM, and WAN—on several problems, achieving high accuracy and suggesting improvements for solving PDEs scalably.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PDE solutions are hindered by the lack of analytical formulas and high computational costs of classical solvers, especially in high-dimensional scenarios.

Method: Through systematic testing on Poisson and Schrödinger equations, the study evaluates three solvers under different configurations like boundary conditions and regularization techniques.

Result: All three solvers achieve low errors for specified tasks, but PINNs excel in reliability, DRM offers the best accuracy-runtime trade-off for stationary problems, and WAN shows competitive performance under specific constraints.

Conclusion: This research provides practical guidelines for choosing neural PDE solvers and validates their potential as scalable tools for handling complex PDEs, underscoring extensions like time-dependent formulations.

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) underpin models across science and
engineering, yet analytical solutions are atypical and classical mesh-based
solvers can be costly in high dimensions. This dissertation presents a unified
comparison of three mesh-free neural PDE solvers, physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs), the deep Ritz method (DRM), and weak adversarial networks
(WANs), on Poisson problems (up to 5D) and the time-independent Schr\"odinger
equation in 1D/2D (infinite well and harmonic oscillator), and extends the
study to a laser-driven case of Schr\"odinger's equation via the
Kramers-Henneberger (KH) transformation.
  Under a common protocol, all methods achieve low $L_2$ errors
($10^{-6}$-$10^{-9}$) when paired with forced boundary conditions (FBCs),
forced nodes (FNs), and orthogonality regularization (OG). Across tasks, PINNs
are the most reliable for accuracy and recovery of excited spectra; DRM offers
the best accuracy-runtime trade-off on stationary problems; WAN is more
sensitive but competitive when weak-form constraints and FN/OG are used
effectively. Sensitivity analyses show that FBC removes boundary-loss tuning,
network width matters more than depth for single-network solvers, and most
gains occur within 5000-10,000 epochs. The same toolkit solves the KH case,
indicating transfer beyond canonical benchmarks.
  We provide practical guidelines for method selection and outline the
following extensions: time-dependent formulations for DRM and WAN, adaptive
residual-driven sampling, parallel multi-state training, and neural domain
decomposition. These results support physics-guided neural solvers as credible,
scalable tools for solving complex PDEs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a reinforcement learning framework to integrate bias mitigation and feature selection, aiming for balanced accuracy, fairness, and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing static feature exclusion strategies fail to mitigate hidden dependencies that affect model predictions, calling for adaptive solutions.

Method: The authors use reinforcement learning (RL) with a reward function balancing performance and fairness, dynamically selecting features during training.

Result: This approach enables adaptive feature selection while addressing bias, avoiding reliance on pre-processing or post hoc corrections.

Conclusion: The framework provides a flexible, scalable solution for bias-prone environments, ensuring better fairness and predictive accuracy.

Abstract: Static feature exclusion strategies often fail to prevent bias when hidden
dependencies influence the model predictions. To address this issue, we explore
a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that integrates bias mitigation and
automated feature selection within a single learning process. Unlike
traditional heuristic-driven filter or wrapper approaches, our RL agent
adaptively selects features using a reward signal that explicitly integrates
predictive performance with fairness considerations. This dynamic formulation
allows the model to balance generalization, accuracy, and equity throughout the
training process, rather than rely exclusively on pre-processing adjustments or
post hoc correction mechanisms. In this paper, we describe the construction of
a multi-component reward function, the specification of the agents action space
over feature subsets, and the integration of this system with ensemble
learning. We aim to provide a flexible and generalizable way to select features
in environments where predictors are correlated and biases can inadvertently
re-emerge.

*Xiaodan Li,Mengjie Wu,Yao Zhu,Yunna Lv,YueFeng Chen,Cen Chen,Jianmei Guo,Hui Xue*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Kelp, a framework for real-time risk detection in Large Models (LMs) using their intermediate hidden states. Kelp surpasses traditional methods, achieving better accuracy and low latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address risks like harmful or biased content generated by Large Models (LMs) and improve the accuracy of in-stream risk detection beyond existing post-hoc methods.

Method: Kelp uses a Streaming Latent Dynamics Head (SLD) to analyze intermediate LM hidden states, predicting temporal evolution of risks. It includes an Anchored Temporal Consistency (ATC) loss for reliable moderation and introduces StreamGuardBench to evaluate performance in real-world settings.

Result: Kelp improves F1 score by an average of 15.61% over state-of-the-art methods while requiring only 20M parameters and less than 0.5 milliseconds of added latency per token.

Conclusion: Kelp offers a reliable, efficient, and accurate solution for integrating risk detection directly into the generation processes of LMs, outperforming traditional detection systems with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Large models (LMs) are powerful content generators, yet their open-ended
nature can also introduce potential risks, such as generating harmful or biased
content. Existing guardrails mostly perform post-hoc detection that may expose
unsafe content before it is caught, and the latency constraints further push
them toward lightweight models, limiting detection accuracy. In this work, we
propose Kelp, a novel plug-in framework that enables streaming risk detection
within the LM generation pipeline. Kelp leverages intermediate LM hidden states
through a Streaming Latent Dynamics Head (SLD), which models the temporal
evolution of risk across the generated sequence for more accurate real-time
risk detection. To ensure reliable streaming moderation in real applications,
we introduce an Anchored Temporal Consistency (ATC) loss to enforce monotonic
harm predictions by embedding a benign-then-harmful temporal prior. Besides,
for a rigorous evaluation of streaming guardrails, we also present
StreamGuardBench-a model-grounded benchmark featuring on-the-fly responses from

and vision-language tasks. Across diverse models and datasets, Kelp
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art post-hoc guardrails and prior plug-in
probes (15.61% higher average F1), while using only 20M parameters and adding
less than 0.5 ms of per-token latency.

### [500] [A Generic Machine Learning Framework for Radio Frequency Fingerprinting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09775)
*Alex Hiles,Bashar I. Ahmad*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a machine learning-based framework for RF fingerprinting to enhance emitter-specific identification and various other RF-related tasks, validated through real-world use cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address limitations in traditional RF fingerprinting methods by leveraging machine learning to automatically extract detailed RF fingerprints for various applications.

Method: A generic framework is proposed for machine learning-enabled RF fingerprinting, supporting tasks like Specific Emitter Identification (SEI), Emitter Data Association (EDA), and RF Emitter Clustering (RFEC), demonstrated using real-world RF datasets.

Result: The proposed framework outperforms traditional approaches and is validated through various use cases in spaceborne surveillance, signal intelligence, and counter-drone measures.

Conclusion: Machine learning-based RF fingerprinting is a more effective and flexible alternative to traditional methods, applicable across diverse domains and transmission scenarios.

Abstract: Fingerprinting Radio Frequency (RF) emitters typically involves finding
unique emitter characteristics that are featured in their transmitted signals.
These fingerprints are nuanced but sufficiently detailed, motivating the
pursuit of methods that can successfully extract them. The most granular
downstream task is known as Specific Emitter Identification (SEI), which
requires a well informed RF fingerprinting (RFF) approach for it to be
successful. RFF and SEI have a long history, with numerous application areas in
defence and civilian contexts such as signal intelligence, electronic
surveillance, physical-layer authentication of wireless communication devices,
to name a few. RFF methods also support many other downstream tasks such as
Emitter Data Association (EDA) and RF Emitter Clustering (RFEC) and are
applicable to a range of transmission types. In recent years, data-driven
approaches have become popular in the RFF domain due to their ability to
automatically learn intricate fingerprints from raw data. These methods
generally deliver superior performance when compared to traditional techniques.
The more traditional approaches are often labour-intensive, inflexible and only
applicable to a particular emitter type or transmission scheme. Therefore, we
consider data-driven Machine Learning (ML)-enabled RFF. In particular, we
propose a generic framework for ML-enabled RFF which is inclusive of several
popular downstream tasks such as SEI, EDA and RFEC. Each task is formulated as
a RF fingerprint-dependent task. A variety of use cases using real RF datasets
are presented here to demonstrate the framework for a range of tasks and
application areas, such as spaceborne surveillance, signal intelligence and
countering drones.

*Lorenzo Nikiforos,Charalampos Antoniadis,Luciano Prono,Fabio Pareschi,Riccardo Rovatti,Gianluca Setti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Vanishing Contributions (VCON), a method to smoothly transition neural models into their compressed versions, mitigating accuracy degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the accuracy degradation caused when directly applying compression methods to neural networks.

Method: VCON uses a gradual transition where the contributions of the uncompressed and compressed models are adjusted during fine-tuning.

Result: VCON consistently improves accuracy by as much as 3-20% across benchmarks in computer vision and natural language processing.

Conclusion: VCON demonstrates a generalized and effective approach for improving compression methods, with broad applicability to various models and tasks.

Abstract: The increasing scale of deep neural networks has led to a growing need for
compression techniques such as pruning, quantization, and low-rank
decomposition. While these methods are very effective in reducing memory,
computation and energy consumption, they often introduce severe accuracy
degradation when applied directly. We introduce Vanishing Contributions (VCON),
a general approach for smoothly transitioning neural models into compressed
form. Rather than replacing the original network directly with its compressed
version, VCON executes the two in parallel during fine-tuning. The contribution
of the original (uncompressed) model is progressively reduced, while that of
the compressed model is gradually increased. This smooth transition allows the
network to adapt over time, improving stability and mitigating accuracy
degradation. We evaluate VCON across computer vision and natural language
processing benchmarks, in combination with multiple compression strategies.
Across all scenarios, VCON leads to consistent improvements: typical gains
exceed 3%, while some configuration exhibits accuracy boosts of 20%. VCON thus
provides a generalizable method that can be applied to the existing compression
techniques, with evidence of consistent gains across multiple benchmarks.

### [502] [Why Do Transformers Fail to Forecast Time Series In-Context?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09776)
*Yufa Zhou,Yixiao Wang,Surbhi Goel,Anru R. Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines why Transformers, despite being powerful, often underperform simpler models in time series forecasting (TSF) and provides theoretical insights into their limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Although Transformers and Large Language Models have been extensively used for time series forecasting, they often fail to surpass simpler models like linear models. There is limited theoretical understanding behind this observation.

Method: The paper develops a theoretical framework using In-Context Learning (ICL) theory to analyze the limitations of Transformers under AR($p$) data. Key focus areas include linear self-attention models’ predictive performance and the impact of context length and inference style.

Result: The analysis demonstrates that: (1) Linear Self-Attention models cannot achieve a lower expected MSE than classical linear models; (2) with infinite context length, LSA models converge to optimal linear predictions; and (3) CoT-style inference results in predictions collapsing to the mean exponentially.

Conclusion: The findings illuminate previously unaddressed theoretical limitations, inform improvements to forecasting model designs, and prompt careful scrutiny in directly applying advanced architectures to TSF problems.

Abstract: Time series forecasting (TSF) remains a challenging and largely unsolved
problem in machine learning, despite significant recent efforts leveraging
Large Language Models (LLMs), which predominantly rely on Transformer
architectures. Empirical evidence consistently shows that even powerful
Transformers often fail to outperform much simpler models, e.g., linear models,
on TSF tasks; however, a rigorous theoretical understanding of this phenomenon
remains limited. In this paper, we provide a theoretical analysis of
Transformers' limitations for TSF through the lens of In-Context Learning (ICL)
theory. Specifically, under AR($p$) data, we establish that: (1) Linear
Self-Attention (LSA) models $\textit{cannot}$ achieve lower expected MSE than
classical linear models for in-context forecasting; (2) as the context length
approaches to infinity, LSA asymptotically recovers the optimal linear
predictor; and (3) under Chain-of-Thought (CoT) style inference, predictions
collapse to the mean exponentially. We empirically validate these findings
through carefully designed experiments. Our theory not only sheds light on
several previously underexplored phenomena but also offers practical insights
for designing more effective forecasting architectures. We hope our work
encourages the broader research community to revisit the fundamental
theoretical limitations of TSF and to critically evaluate the direct
application of increasingly sophisticated architectures without deeper
scrutiny.

### [503] [Operator Learning for Power Systems Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09704)
*Matthew Schlegel,Matthew E. Taylor,Mostafa Farrokhabadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates machine learning methods, specifically operator learning, to create time-domain simulation models that are scalable and computationally efficient, enabling stable integration of renewable energy resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of computationally expensive time-domain simulations in renewable energy-integrated grids due to the ultra-fast dynamic phenomena, which hinder their scalability and impact efforts for climate change mitigation.

Method: The authors explored operator learning methods, which are machine learning techniques that learn mappings between functions, focusing on the principle of simulation time step-invariance. They benchmarked three methods through proof-of-concept tests on a simplified model system.

Result: The benchmarks demonstrated the feasibility of simulation time step-invariance in operator learning methods. The models showed promise in both zero-shot super-resolution and generalization across dynamic regimes.

Conclusion: Operator learning is a viable approach for scalable and efficient modeling of dynamic physical systems, and it addresses critical computational challenges in integrating renewable energy resources into power grids.

Abstract: Time domain simulation, i.e., modeling the system's evolution over time, is a
crucial tool for studying and enhancing power system stability and dynamic
performance. However, these simulations become computationally intractable for
renewable-penetrated grids, due to the small simulation time step required to
capture renewable energy resources' ultra-fast dynamic phenomena in the range
of 1-50 microseconds. This creates a critical need for solutions that are both
fast and scalable, posing a major barrier for the stable integration of
renewable energy resources and thus climate change mitigation. This paper
explores operator learning, a family of machine learning methods that learn
mappings between functions, as a surrogate model for these costly simulations.
The paper investigates, for the first time, the fundamental concept of
simulation time step-invariance, which enables models trained on coarse time
steps to generalize to fine-resolution dynamics. Three operator learning
methods are benchmarked on a simple test system that, while not incorporating
practical complexities of renewable-penetrated grids, serves as a first
proof-of-concept to demonstrate the viability of time step-invariance. Models
are evaluated on (i) zero-shot super-resolution, where training is performed on
a coarse simulation time step and inference is performed at super-resolution,
and (ii) generalization between stable and unstable dynamic regimes. This work
addresses a key challenge in the integration of renewable energy for the
mitigation of climate change by benchmarking operator learning methods to model
physical systems.

### [504] [Large Language Models for Imbalanced Classification: Diversity makes the difference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09783)
*Dang Nguyen,Sunil Gupta,Kien Do,Thin Nguyen,Taylor Braund,Alexis Whitton,Svetha Venkatesh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel LLM-based oversampling method for tackling imbalanced classification while enhancing the diversity of synthetic samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing oversampling methods, including LLM-based approaches, often fail to generate diverse samples, limiting their robustness and generalizability in imbalanced classification.

Method: The proposed method improves diversity in synthetic samples by introducing a conditional sampling strategy, a new permutation fine-tuning strategy for LLMs, and fine-tuning on both minority and interpolated samples.

Result: The proposed method significantly outperforms eight state-of-the-art baselines across 10 tabular datasets. The generated samples are diverse and realistic.

Conclusion: The method is effective in enhancing diversity through theoretical entropy-based analysis and demonstrates superior performance in imbalanced classification tasks.

Abstract: Oversampling is one of the most widely used approaches for addressing
imbalanced classification. The core idea is to generate additional minority
samples to rebalance the dataset. Most existing methods, such as SMOTE, require
converting categorical variables into numerical vectors, which often leads to
information loss. Recently, large language model (LLM)-based methods have been
introduced to overcome this limitation. However, current LLM-based approaches
typically generate minority samples with limited diversity, reducing robustness
and generalizability in downstream classification tasks. To address this gap,
we propose a novel LLM-based oversampling method designed to enhance diversity.
First, we introduce a sampling strategy that conditions synthetic sample
generation on both minority labels and features. Second, we develop a new
permutation strategy for fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs. Third, we fine-tune the
LLM not only on minority samples but also on interpolated samples to further
enrich variability. Extensive experiments on 10 tabular datasets demonstrate
that our method significantly outperforms eight SOTA baselines. The generated
synthetic samples are both realistic and diverse. Moreover, we provide
theoretical analysis through an entropy-based perspective, proving that our
method encourages diversity in the generated samples.

### [505] [A Unified Framework for Lifted Training and Inversion Approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09796)
*Xiaoyu Wang,Alexandra Valavanis,Azhir Mahmood,Andreas Mang,Martin Benning,Audrey Repetti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified framework for lifted training methods to address challenges in deep neural network training, demonstrating improvements in optimization and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in traditional gradient-based optimization methods used in deep neural network training, such as vanishing gradients, non-smooth activations, and limited parallelisation.

Method: The paper reformulates deep neural network training into a higher-dimensional constrained optimization problem using lifted training techniques and tools from convex optimization like Bregman distances.

Result: Numerical results showcase the effectiveness and stability of the introduced lifted Bregman approach, especially for architectures with proximal activations.

Conclusion: Lifted training frameworks provide distributed optimization benefits, handle non-differentiable activations, and enhance training landscapes, demonstrating practical advantages in neural network applications.

Abstract: The training of deep neural networks predominantly relies on a combination of
gradient-based optimisation and back-propagation for the computation of the
gradient. While incredibly successful, this approach faces challenges such as
vanishing or exploding gradients, difficulties with non-smooth activations, and
an inherently sequential structure that limits parallelisation. Lifted training
methods offer an alternative by reformulating the nested optimisation problem
into a higher-dimensional, constrained optimisation problem where the
constraints are no longer enforced directly but penalised with penalty terms.
This chapter introduces a unified framework that encapsulates various lifted
training strategies, including the Method of Auxiliary Coordinates, Fenchel
Lifted Networks, and Lifted Bregman Training, and demonstrates how diverse
architectures, such as Multi-Layer Perceptrons, Residual Neural Networks, and
Proximal Neural Networks fit within this structure. By leveraging tools from
convex optimisation, particularly Bregman distances, the framework facilitates
distributed optimisation, accommodates non-differentiable proximal activations,
and can improve the conditioning of the training landscape. We discuss the
implementation of these methods using block-coordinate descent strategies,
including deterministic implementations enhanced by accelerated and adaptive
optimisation techniques, as well as implicit stochastic gradient methods.
Furthermore, we explore the application of this framework to inverse problems,
detailing methodologies for both the training of specialised networks (e.g.,
unrolled architectures) and the stable inversion of pre-trained networks.
Numerical results on standard imaging tasks validate the effectiveness and
stability of the lifted Bregman approach compared to conventional training,
particularly for architectures employing proximal activations.

### [506] [Group-Adaptive Adversarial Learning for Robust Fake News Detection Against Malicious Comments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09712)
*Zhao Tong,Chunlin Gong,Yimeng Gu,Haichao Shi,Qiang Liu,Shu Wu,Xiao-Yu Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the vulnerabilities of fake news detection (FND) models to adversarial comments, proposing a group-adaptive adversarial training strategy that boosts robustness without compromising detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the issue that FND models, despite performing well under standard conditions, are susceptible to adversarial comments subtly altering their predictions, which undermines trust in social media platforms.

Method: The method involves categorizing adversarial comments into three types (perceptual, cognitive, societal), generating category-specific attacks using large language models (LLMs) for adversarial training, and implementing a Dirichlet-based adaptive sampling mechanism to dynamically adjust the focus on comment categories during training.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates strong detection accuracy while significantly enhancing the robustness of FND models against diverse adversarial comment attacks, as validated by experiments on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that their group-adaptive adversarial training strategy effectively addresses existing vulnerabilities of FND models, providing a solution that is both accurate and robust to adversarial perturbations.

Abstract: The spread of fake news online distorts public judgment and erodes trust in
social media platforms. Although recent fake news detection (FND) models
perform well in standard settings, they remain vulnerable to adversarial
comments-authored by real users or by large language models (LLMs)-that subtly
shift model decisions. In view of this, we first present a comprehensive
evaluation of comment attacks to existing fake news detectors and then
introduce a group-adaptive adversarial training strategy to improve the
robustness of FND models. To be specific, our approach comprises three steps:
(1) dividing adversarial comments into three psychologically grounded
categories: perceptual, cognitive, and societal; (2) generating diverse,
category-specific attacks via LLMs to enhance adversarial training; and (3)
applying a Dirichlet-based adaptive sampling mechanism (InfoDirichlet Adjusting
Mechanism) that dynamically adjusts the learning focus across different comment
categories during training. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our
method maintains strong detection accuracy while substantially increasing
robustness to a wide range of adversarial comment perturbations.

*Zhenlong Liu,Hao Zeng,Weiran Huang,Hongxin Wei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces PTDI, a method for rigorously identifying training data while controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) in large-scale models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing methods for identifying training data, such as lack of statistical guarantees and reliance on strong assumptions.

Method: PTDI computes p-values for data points using known unseen data, estimates test set data usage proportion, and selects data based on scaled p-value thresholds to ensure FDR control.

Result: The proposed PTDI method demonstrated strict FDR control and higher power through extensive experiments on Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision-Language Models (VLMs), and various datasets.

Conclusion: PTDI provides a provable and efficient way to identify training data, ensuring rigorous FDR control and improved performance over traditional methods.

Abstract: Identifying training data within large-scale models is critical for copyright
litigation, privacy auditing, and ensuring fair evaluation. The conventional
approaches treat it as a simple binary classification task without statistical
guarantees. A recent approach is designed to control the false discovery rate
(FDR), but its guarantees rely on strong, easily violated assumptions. In this
paper, we introduce Provable Training Data Identification (PTDI), a rigorous
method that identifies a set of training data with strict false discovery rate
(FDR) control. Specifically, our method computes p-values for each data point
using a set of known unseen data, and then constructs a conservative estimator
for the data usage proportion of the test set, which allows us to scale these
p-values. Our approach then selects the final set of training data by
identifying all points whose scaled p-values fall below a data-dependent
threshold. This entire procedure enables the discovery of training data with
provable, strict FDR control and significantly boosted power. Extensive
experiments across a wide range of models (LLMs and VLMs), and datasets
demonstrate that PTDI strictly controls the FDR and achieves higher power.

*Michael Crawshaw,Chirag Modi,Mingrui Liu,Robert M. Gower*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores steepest descent methods for neural networks, introduces new optimizers like MuonMax, integrates them with model-based momentum (Momo), and finds them effective for hyperparameter robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the sensitivity of existing optimizers (like Adam and Muon) to hyperparameters and improve robustness and performance in neural network training.

Method: The authors systematically study norm definitions, explore non-Euclidean gradient descent methods, derive new optimizer variants like MuonMax, and incorporate model-based momentum (Momo).

Result: MuonMax optimizer showed higher robustness to learning rate sensitivity, and Momo variants of the optimizers improved robustness to hyperparameter tuning while often achieving better validation scores.

Conclusion: The authors recommend combining Momo with MuonMax as a robust optimization approach for new tasks, reducing the dependence on costly hyperparameter tuning.

Abstract: To define a steepest descent method over a neural network, we need to choose
a norm for each layer, a way to aggregate these norms across layers, and
whether to use normalization. We systematically explore different alternatives
for aggregating norms across layers, both formalizing existing combinations of
Adam and the recently proposed Muon as a type of non-Euclidean gradient
descent, and deriving new variants of the Muon optimizer. Through a
comprehensive experimental evaluation of the optimizers within our framework,
we find that Muon is sensitive to the choice of learning rate, whereas a new
variant we call MuonMax is significantly more robust. We then show how to
combine any non-Euclidean gradient method with model based momentum (known as
Momo). The new Momo variants of Muon are significantly more robust to
hyperparameter tuning, and often achieve a better validation score. Thus for
new tasks, where the optimal hyperparameters are not known, we advocate for
using Momo in combination with MuonMax to save on costly hyperparameter tuning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses federated clustering, focusing on privacy-friendly k-means clustering across interconnected devices without sharing local datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable collaborative clustering across devices holding private data without compromising privacy.

Method: The authors propose a federated k-means clustering algorithm using GTVMin, where local cluster centroids are updated based on a modified k-means problem with a discrepancy penalty term.

Result: The algorithm facilitates privacy-sensitive clustering by only requiring devices to share aggregated information during computations.

Conclusion: The proposed solution successfully balances collaboration for clustering and privacy protection in decentralized environments.

Abstract: We consider the problem of federated clustering, where interconnected devices
have access to private local datasets and need to jointly cluster the overall
dataset without sharing their local dataset. Our focus is on hard clustering
based on the k-means principle. We formulate federated k-means clustering as an
instance of GTVMin. This formulation naturally lends to a federated k-means
algorithm where each device updates local cluster centroids by solving a
modified local k-means problem. The modification involves adding a penalty term
to measure the discrepancy between the cluster centroid of neighbouring
devices. Our federated k-means algorithm is privacy-friendly as it only
requires sharing aggregated information among interconnected devices.

*Kangping Hu,Stephen Mussmann*

TL;DR: The paper explores Bayesian Decision Theory (BDT) for myopic active learning, deriving methods and algorithms like ParBaLS EPIG that are efficient for scalable batch settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of selecting appropriate active learning acquisition functions and improve the scalability and performance of such methods in large batch settings.

Method: Derived Bayesian Decision Theory for myopic active learning to conceptualize existing methods like EER and EPIG, and created the ParBaLS algorithm for efficient batch sampling in active learning.

Result: Experimental evaluations on various datasets show that ParBaLS EPIG outperforms existing methods in terms of performance and budget efficiency using Bayesian Logistic Regression on Neural Embeddings.

Conclusion: The study provides a unified framework linking existing active learning approaches to BDT and presents ParBaLS EPIG as a scalable solution for high-performance active learning.

Abstract: Over the past couple of decades, many active learning acquisition functions
have been proposed, leaving practitioners with an unclear choice of which to
use. Bayesian Decision Theory (BDT) offers a universal principle to guide
decision-making. In this work, we derive BDT for (Bayesian) active learning in
the myopic framework, where we imagine we only have one more point to label.
This derivation leads to effective algorithms such as Expected Error Reduction
(EER), Expected Predictive Information Gain (EPIG), and other algorithms that
appear in the literature. Furthermore, we show that BAIT (active learning based
on V-optimal experimental design) can be derived from BDT and asymptotic
approximations. A key challenge of such methods is the difficult scaling to
large batch sizes, leading to either computational challenges (BatchBALD) or
dramatic performance drops (top-$B$ selection). Here, using a particular
formulation of the decision process, we derive Partial Batch Label Sampling
(ParBaLS) for the EPIG algorithm. We show experimentally for several datasets
that ParBaLS EPIG gives superior performance for a fixed budget and Bayesian
Logistic Regression on Neural Embeddings. Our code is available at

*Chenxu Wang,Hao Li,Yiqun Zhang,Linyao Chen,Jianhao Chen,Ping Jian,Peng Ye,Qiaosheng Zhang,Shuyue Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve routing performance for large language models (LLMs) using in-context vectors to represent model capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance and enabling easy integration of new models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations in current model routing systems, such as reliance on retraining when adding new models and challenges in accurate model representation for optimal routing.

Method: The proposed approach uses in-context vectors for representation, combining a projector, an LLM-based router, and profiling models to align vector representations and predict model performance across queries without the need for retraining.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method achieves state-of-the-art routing performance for both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks, and it supports seamless integration of new models.

Conclusion: The novel routing method using in-context vectors significantly enhances both routing accuracy and scalability for LLMs, providing an effective solution to current challenges.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit complementary strengths. Model
routing harnesses these strengths by dynamically directing each query to the
most suitable model, given a candidate model pool. However, routing performance
relies on accurate model representations, and adding new models typically
requires retraining, limiting scalability. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel routing method using in-context vectors to represent model
capabilities. The method proceeds in two stages. First, queries are embedded
and projected into vectors, with a projector and LLM-based router trained to
reconstruct the original queries, aligning vector representations with the
router's semantic space. Second, each candidate model is profiled on a query
set, and the router learns -- based on in-context vectors of query and model
performance -- to predict whether each model can correctly answer new queries.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
routing performance in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks.
Moreover, our method allows for seamless integration of new models without
retraining the router. The code is available at

*Yunlong Feng,Qiang Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper examines robust nonparametric regression in the presence of heavy-tailed noise, focusing on unbounded hypothesis spaces using robust loss functions (e.g., Huber regression) and proposing new error bounds and convergence rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges posed by heavy-tailed noise and unbounded hypothesis spaces in nonparametric regression while ensuring robustness through improved error analysis.

Method: The authors tackle standard concentration tool limitations under weak moment assumptions and develop a probabilistic effective hypothesis space to enable a bias-variance decomposition. They propose new comparison theorems and derive finite-sample error bounds for Huber regression in RKHS.

Result: The paper establishes new insights into the trade-offs in robust learning by linking excess robust risk to L2 prediction error. It provides error bounds and convergence rates that are valid even under weak moment conditions and heavy-tailed noise.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes that prediction error, not excess generalization risk, should be the focus of robust learning analysis. It also introduces principled approaches and tuning mechanisms for robust regression in unbounded spaces.

Abstract: We investigate robust nonparametric regression in the presence of
heavy-tailed noise, where the hypothesis class may contain unbounded functions
and robustness is ensured via a robust loss function $\ell_\sigma$. Using Huber
regression as a close-up example within Tikhonov-regularized risk minimization
in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS), we address two central challenges:
(i) the breakdown of standard concentration tools under weak moment
assumptions, and (ii) the analytical difficulties introduced by unbounded
hypothesis spaces. Our first message is conceptual: conventional
generalization-error bounds for robust losses do not faithfully capture
out-of-sample performance. We argue that learnability should instead be
quantified through prediction error, namely the $L_2$-distance to the truth
$f^\star$, which is $\sigma$-independent and directly reflects the target of
robust estimation. To make this workable under unboundedness, we introduce a
\emph{probabilistic effective hypothesis space} that confines the estimator
with high probability and enables a meaningful bias--variance decomposition
under weak $(1+\epsilon)$-moment conditions. Technically, we establish new
comparison theorems linking the excess robust risk to the $L_2$ prediction
error up to a residual of order $\mathcal{O}(\sigma^{-2\epsilon})$, clarifying
the robustness--bias trade-off induced by the scale parameter $\sigma$.
Building on this, we derive explicit finite-sample error bounds and convergence
rates for Huber regression in RKHS that hold without uniform boundedness and
under heavy-tailed noise. Our study delivers principled tuning rules, extends
beyond Huber to other robust losses, and highlights prediction error, not
excess generalization risk, as the fundamental lens for analyzing robust
learning.

TL;DR: Narrative Learning leverages natural language explanations for model refinement instead of numerical optimization, achieving higher accuracy than existing explainable ML models on most datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve interpretability and accuracy of machine learning models by using natural language as the basis for model refinement instead of traditional numerical approaches.

Method: Introduce and test Narrative Learning across synthetic and natural datasets by iteratively refining classification criteria with explanatory prompts.

Result: Narrative Learning outperformed 7 baseline explainable ML models in accuracy on 5 out of 6 datasets due to advancements in language models.

Conclusion: Narrative Learning demonstrates better accuracy and explanatory comprehensibility than explainable machine learning models, emphasizing natural language as an effective analytical tool.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Narrative Learning, a methodology where models
are defined entirely in natural language and iteratively refine their
classification criteria using explanatory prompts rather than traditional
numerical optimisation. We report on experiments to evaluate the accuracy and
potential of this approach using 3 synthetic and 3 natural datasets and compare
them against 7 baseline explainable machine learning models. We demonstrate
that on 5 out of 6 of these datasets, Narrative Learning became more accurate
than the baseline explainable models in 2025 or earlier because of improvements
in language models. We also report on trends in the lexicostatistics of these
models' outputs as a proxy for the comprehensibility of the explanations.

*Parsa Gooya,Reinel Sospedra-Alfonso*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a conditional Variational Autoencoder model for Arctic sea ice concentration predictions, improving forecast calibration, observational alignment, and error reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address systematic biases and complex errors in seasonal forecasts of Arctic sea ice concentration to better support decision-making with uncertainty quantification.

Method: Develop a probabilistic error correction framework using a conditional Variational Autoencoder model to map the conditional distribution of observations based on biased predictions.

Result: The adjusted forecasts exhibit improved calibration, closer alignment to the observational distribution, and reduced errors compared to traditional methods such as climatological mean adjustments.

Conclusion: The proposed probabilistic approach enhances the accuracy and reliability of Arctic sea ice forecasts, offering better tools for decision-making.

Abstract: Seasonal forecast of Arctic sea ice concentration is key to mitigate the
negative impact and assess potential opportunities posed by the rapid decline
of sea ice coverage. Seasonal prediction systems based on climate models often
show systematic biases and complex spatio-temporal errors that grow with the
forecasts. Consequently, operational predictions are routinely bias corrected
and calibrated using retrospective forecasts. For predictions of Arctic sea ice
concentration, error corrections are mainly based on one-to-one post-processing
methods including climatological mean or linear regression correction and, more
recently, machine learning. Such deterministic adjustments are confined at best
to the limited number of costly-to-run ensemble members of the raw forecast.
However, decision-making requires proper quantification of uncertainty and
likelihood of events, particularly of extremes. We introduce a probabilistic
error correction framework based on a conditional Variational Autoencoder model
to map the conditional distribution of observations given the biased model
prediction. This method naturally allows for generating large ensembles of
adjusted forecasts. We evaluate our model using deterministic and probabilistic
metrics and show that the adjusted forecasts are better calibrated, closer to
the observational distribution, and have smaller errors than climatological
mean adjusted forecasts.

### [515] [Evaluating LLM-Based Process Explanations under Progressive Behavioral-Input Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09732)
*P. van Oerle,R. H. Bemthuis,F. A. Bukhsh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores how reducing behavioral input sizes for process model discovery affects explanation quality by LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study was motivated by the high computational cost of explaining large behavioral abstractions using LLMs.

Method: The method involves discovering process models at different input sizes, generating explanations using one LLM, and evaluating these explanations using another LLM.

Result: Explanation quality was largely preserved despite moderate reductions in the input data, suggesting a trade-off between computational cost and explanation quality.

Conclusion: The findings support the potential for using LLMs for cost-efficient process analysis in resource-limited environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate textual
explanations of process models discovered from event logs. Producing
explanations from large behavioral abstractions (e.g., directly-follows graphs
or Petri nets) can be computationally expensive. This paper reports an
exploratory evaluation of explanation quality under progressive
behavioral-input reduction, where models are discovered from progressively
smaller prefixes of a fixed log. Our pipeline (i) discovers models at multiple
input sizes, (ii) prompts an LLM to generate explanations, and (iii) uses a
second LLM to assess completeness, bottleneck identification, and suggested
improvements. On synthetic logs, explanation quality is largely preserved under
moderate reduction, indicating a practical cost-quality trade-off. The study is
exploratory, as the scores are LLM-based (comparative signals rather than
ground truth) and the data are synthetic. The results suggest a path toward
more computationally efficient, LLM-assisted process analysis in
resource-constrained settings.

### [516] [Chain-of-Influence: Tracing Interdependencies Across Time and Features in Clinical Predictive Modelings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09895)
*Yubo Li,Rema Padman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Chain-of-Influence (CoI), a deep learning framework for modeling clinical time-series data by creating explicit graphs of feature interactions over time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle to explicitly model latent, time-varying dependencies and propagation of influence among clinical variables, often relying on black-box or simple aggregation techniques.

Method: CoI uses a multi-level attention mechanism with temporal attention to identify critical time points and cross-feature attention to trace directed influences between features, creating an interpretable graph of interactions over time.

Result: CoI outperforms existing methods in predictive accuracy and reveals clinically meaningful patterns of disease progression in mortality and disease prediction tasks using datasets like MIMIC-IV.

Conclusion: CoI balances interpretability and performance, offering transparent insights into temporal and cross-feature relationships, aiding clinical decision-making and personalized medicine.

Abstract: Modeling clinical time-series data is hampered by the challenge of capturing
latent, time-varying dependencies among features. State-of-the-art approaches
often rely on black-box mechanisms or simple aggregation, failing to explicitly
model how the influence of one clinical variable propagates through others over
time. We propose $\textbf{Chain-of-Influence (CoI)}$, an interpretable deep
learning framework that constructs an explicit, time-unfolded graph of feature
interactions. CoI leverages a multi-level attention architecture: first, a
temporal attention layer identifies critical time points in a patient's record;
second, a cross-feature attention layer models the directed influence from
features at these time points to subsequent features. This design enables the
tracing of influence pathways, providing a granular audit trail that shows how
any feature at any time contributes to the final prediction, both directly and
through its influence on other variables. We evaluate CoI on mortality and
disease progression tasks using the MIMIC-IV dataset and a private chronic
kidney disease cohort. Our framework significantly outperforms existing methods
in predictive accuracy. More importantly, through case studies, we show that
CoI can uncover clinically meaningful, patient-specific patterns of disease
progression that are opaque to other models, offering unprecedented
transparency into the temporal and cross-feature dependencies that inform
clinical decision-making.

### [517] [ARROW: An Adaptive Rollout and Routing Method for Global Weather Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09734)
*Jindong Tian,Yifei Ding,Ronghui Xu,Hao Miao,Chenjuan Guo,Bin Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces ARROW, an innovative method for long-term global weather forecasting that addresses challenges in modeling spatial and multi-scale temporal dependencies and error accumulation via adaptive rollout.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods poorly model weather's spatial and multi-scale temporal dependencies and accumulate errors over long-term forecasts, necessitating a more advanced approach.

Method: ARROW combines a multi-interval forecasting model with Shared-Private Mixture-of-Experts and Ring Positional Encoding for spatial and temporal modeling, alongside a reinforcement learning-based adaptive rollout scheduler.

Result: Experiments show ARROW outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in global weather forecasting.

Conclusion: ARROW sets a new paradigm for weather forecasting, demonstrating effective multi-scale modeling and adaptive rollout strategies to handle complex atmospheric dynamics.

Abstract: Weather forecasting is a fundamental task in spatiotemporal data analysis,
with broad applications across a wide range of domains. Existing data-driven
forecasting methods typically model atmospheric dynamics over a fixed short
time interval (e.g., 6 hours) and rely on naive autoregression-based rollout
for long-term forecasting (e.g., 138 hours). However, this paradigm suffers
from two key limitations: (1) it often inadequately models the spatial and
multi-scale temporal dependencies inherent in global weather systems, and (2)
the rollout strategy struggles to balance error accumulation with the capture
of fine-grained atmospheric variations. In this study, we propose ARROW, an
Adaptive-Rollout Multi-scale temporal Routing method for Global Weather
Forecasting. To contend with the first limitation, we construct a
multi-interval forecasting model that forecasts weather across different time
intervals. Within the model, the Shared-Private Mixture-of-Experts captures
both shared patterns and specific characteristics of atmospheric dynamics
across different time scales, while Ring Positional Encoding accurately encodes
the circular latitude structure of the Earth when representing spatial
information. For the second limitation, we develop an adaptive rollout
scheduler based on reinforcement learning, which selects the most suitable time
interval to forecast according to the current weather state. Experimental
results demonstrate that ARROW achieves state-of-the-art performance in global
weather forecasting, establishing a promising paradigm in this field.

### [518] [InterCorpRel-LLM: Enhancing Financial Relational Understanding with Graph-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09735)
*Qianyou Sun,Jiexin Zheng,Bohan Jin,Lihua Chen,Yijie Peng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces InterCorpRel-LLM, a framework combining GNNs and LLMs to analyze inter-firm relationships efficiently. It outperforms existing baselines significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inter-firm relationships are essential for financial analysis and corporate governance, but current methods struggle due to challenges like scale, sparsity, and contextual nuances in corporate data.

Method: The framework integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Large Language Models (LLMs) using proprietary data and tasks such as graph matching, industry classification, and supply relation prediction.

Result: InterCorpRel-LLM achieves an F-score of 0.8543 in supply relation identification, vastly outperforming GPT-5 (0.2287) and generalizing well in tasks like zero-shot competitor identification.

Conclusion: InterCorpRel-LLM enables effective analysis of corporate networks, enhancing decision-making and risk management in dynamic markets through a robust framework.

Abstract: Identifying inter-firm relationships such as supply and competitive ties is
critical for financial analysis and corporate governance, yet remains
challenging due to the scale, sparsity, and contextual dependence of corporate
data. Graph-based methods capture structure but miss semantic depth, while
large language models (LLMs) excel at text but remain limited in their ability
to represent relational dependencies. To address this, we propose
InterCorpRel-LLM, a cross-modal framework that integrates GNNs with LLMs,
supported by a proprietary dataset derived from FactSet supply chain records
and three tailored training tasks: company graph matching, industry
classification, and supply relation prediction. This design enables effective
joint modeling of structure and semantics. Experiments show that
InterCorpRel-LLM substantially outperforms strong baselines, including GPT-5,
on a supply relation identification task, achieving an F-score of 0.8543 vs.
0.2287 with only a 7B-parameter backbone and lightweight training. The model
also generalizes to zero-shot competitor identification, underscoring its
ability to capture nuanced inter-firm dynamics. Our framework thus provides
analysts and strategists with a robust tool for mapping and reasoning about
complex corporate networks, enhancing decision-making and risk management in
dynamic markets.

### [519] [AutoGD: Automatic Learning Rate Selection for Gradient Descent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09923)
*Nikola Surjanovic,Alexandre Bouchard-Côté,Trevor Campbell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces AutoGD, an adaptive gradient descent method that autonomously adjusts learning rates for optimization tasks, eliminating manual tuning efforts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gradient-based optimization methods require carefully tuned learning rate schedules, which can be cumbersome and impractical, especially for algorithms utilizing other inner-loop methods.

Method: The authors propose AutoGD, a method that dynamically determines whether to increase or decrease the learning rate at each iteration. Convergence is mathematically established, showing its recovery of optimal GD rates for a broad class of functions without requiring smoothness constants.

Result: Experiments confirm AutoGD's effectiveness across diverse traditional problems and variational inference tasks, showcasing its utility and extending its principles to AutoBFGS and AutoLBFGS.

Conclusion: AutoGD significantly reduces user effort in tuning learning rates, offers robust performance, and can generalize to other advanced optimization methods.

Abstract: The performance of gradient-based optimization methods, such as standard
gradient descent (GD), greatly depends on the choice of learning rate. However,
it can require a non-trivial amount of user tuning effort to select an
appropriate learning rate schedule. When such methods appear as inner loops of
other algorithms, expecting the user to tune the learning rates may be
impractical. To address this, we introduce AutoGD: a gradient descent method
that automatically determines whether to increase or decrease the learning rate
at a given iteration. We establish the convergence of AutoGD, and show that we
can recover the optimal rate of GD (up to a constant) for a broad class of
functions without knowledge of smoothness constants. Experiments on a variety
of traditional problems and variational inference optimization tasks
demonstrate strong performance of the method, along with its extensions to
AutoBFGS and AutoLBFGS.

*Ayoub Bouguettaya,Elizabeth M. Stuart*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study compared a machine learning-based personality model with the Big Five using Reddit data, finding the Big Five superior in describing online communities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the robustness of the Big Five personality model by comparing it to a machine learning-based alternative derived from an adjective list.

Method: A bottom-up personality model was created using machine learning on an adjective list and tested against the Big Five model using data from one million Reddit comments.

Result: The Big Five demonstrated superior descriptive power and coherence compared to the machine learning model, which lacked meaningful distinctions and failed to recover key traits like Extraversion.

Conclusion: The Big Five remains a robust framework for personality description, while machine learning models may be context-dependent and unable to supplant well-established psychological theories.

Abstract: The lexical hypothesis posits that personality traits are encoded in language
and is foundational to models like the Big Five. We created a bottom-up
personality model from a classic adjective list using machine learning and
compared its descriptive utility against the Big Five by analyzing one million
Reddit comments. The Big Five, particularly Agreeableness, Conscientiousness,
and Neuroticism, provided a far more powerful and interpretable description of
these online communities. In contrast, our machine-learning clusters provided
no meaningful distinctions, failed to recover the Extraversion trait, and
lacked the psychometric coherence of the Big Five. These results affirm the
robustness of the Big Five and suggest personality's semantic structure is
context-dependent. Our findings show that while machine learning can help check
the ecological validity of established psychological theories, it may not be
able to replace them.

### [521] [Reliable Active Learning from Unreliable Labels via Neural Collapse Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09740)
*Atharv Goel,Sharat Agarwal,Saket Anand,Chetan Arora*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes NCAL-R, a framework for Active Learning that uses neural collapse geometry to address issues like noisy labels and data distribution shifts, outperforming conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenges of Active Learning when faced with noisy labels and distribution shifts, which amplify annotation errors and redundancy.

Method: NCAL-R employs two signals: Class-Mean Alignment Perturbation score for structural stability and Feature Fluctuation score for representation stability, integrating them to enhance Active Learning decisions.

Result: Experiments on ImageNet-100 and CIFAR100 demonstrate NCAL-R's superior accuracy, robustness under label noise, and generalization to out-of-distribution data compared to standard Active Learning baselines.

Conclusion: Incorporating geometric reliability into Active Learning makes annotation pipelines more trustworthy and robust against errors, enabling efficient real-world deployment.

Abstract: Active Learning (AL) promises to reduce annotation cost by prioritizing
informative samples, yet its reliability is undermined when labels are noisy or
when the data distribution shifts. In practice, annotators make mistakes, rare
categories are ambiguous, and conventional AL heuristics (uncertainty,
diversity) often amplify such errors by repeatedly selecting mislabeled or
redundant samples. We propose Reliable Active Learning via Neural Collapse
Geometry (NCAL-R), a framework that leverages the emergent geometric
regularities of deep networks to counteract unreliable supervision. Our method
introduces two complementary signals: (i) a Class-Mean Alignment Perturbation
score, which quantifies how candidate samples structurally stabilize or distort
inter-class geometry, and (ii) a Feature Fluctuation score, which captures
temporal instability of representations across training checkpoints. By
combining these signals, NCAL-R prioritizes samples that both preserve class
separation and highlight ambiguous regions, mitigating the effect of noisy or
redundant labels. Experiments on ImageNet-100 and CIFAR100 show that NCAL-R
consistently outperforms standard AL baselines, achieving higher accuracy with
fewer labels, improved robustness under synthetic label noise, and stronger
generalization to out-of-distribution data. These results suggest that
incorporating geometric reliability criteria into acquisition decisions can
make Active Learning less brittle to annotation errors and distribution shifts,
a key step toward trustworthy deployment in real-world labeling pipelines. Our

*Jun Yin,Runcheng Cai,Shiliang Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CRG_IMSC, an improved incomplete multi-view spectral clustering method, which avoids using K-means and directly generates clustering results with enhanced connectivity representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing multi-view spectral clustering methods that rely on K-means and inadequately utilize sample connectivity information.

Method: CRG_IMSC enforces a nonnegative constraint to directly obtain clustering results from extracted features. Additionally, it uses spectral clustering results to construct a connectivity matrix and optimizes residual self-representation.

Result: CRG_IMSC demonstrated superior performance compared to existing clustering methods on benchmark datasets, and its iterative algorithm was proven to converge effectively.

Conclusion: CRG_IMSC effectively enhances incomplete multi-view spectral clustering by improving sample connectivity utilization and avoiding reliance on K-means, achieving improved and reliable clustering results.

Abstract: Incomplete multi-view spectral clustering generalizes spectral clustering to
multi-view data and simultaneously realizes the partition of multi-view data
with missing views. For this category of method, K-means algorithm needs to be
performed to generate the clustering result after the procedure of feature
extraction. More importantly, the connectivity of samples reflected by the
clustering result is not utilized effectively. To overcome these defects, we
propose Clustering Result re-Guided Incomplete Multi-view Spectral Clustering
(CRG_IMSC). CRG_IMSC obtains the clustering result directly by imposing
nonnegative constraint to the extracted feature. Furthermore, it constructs the
connectivity matrix according to the result of spectral clustering, and
minimizes the residual of self-representation based on the connectivity matrix.
A novel iterative algorithm using multiplicative update is developed to solve
the optimization problem of CRG_IMSC, and its convergence is proved rigorously.
On benchmark datasets, for multi-view data, CRG_IMSC performs better than
state-of-the-art clustering methods, and the experimental results also
demonstrate the convergence of CRG_IMSC algorithm.

*Shuo Zhao,Yongqiang Li,Yu Feng,Zhongsheng Hou,Yuanjing Feng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper develops a framework for state aggregation in MDPs to simplify computations while maintaining optimal policy performance. It introduces Homomorphic Policy Gradient (HPG) methods to address approximation errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the challenge of computational complexity in solving MDPs without compromising the optimality of the policies.

Method: The paper introduces a homomorphism-based abstraction framework to reduce MDP complexity, alongside analyzing theoretical conditions for policy equivalence. It then proposes HPG and EBHPG methods to handle approximation errors efficiently.

Result: The paper establishes conditions for optimizing in the abstract MDP space while retaining optimal policy equivalence in the original MDP. Experimental results validate their theory and show the proposed methods perform well compared to seven others.

Conclusion: Homomorphic-based aggregation provides a viable approach to simplifying MDPs, ensuring theoretical guarantees and practical performance balance.

Abstract: State aggregation aims to reduce the computational complexity of solving
Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) while preserving the performance of the
original system. A fundamental challenge lies in optimizing policies within the
aggregated, or abstract, space such that the performance remains optimal in the
ground MDP-a property referred to as {"}optimal policy equivalence {"}.
  This paper presents an abstraction framework based on the notion of
homomorphism, in which two Markov chains are deemed homomorphic if their value
functions exhibit a linear relationship. Within this theoretical framework, we
establish a sufficient condition for the equivalence of optimal policy.
  We further examine scenarios where the sufficient condition is not met and
derive an upper bound on the approximation error and a performance lower bound
for the objective function under the ground MDP. We propose Homomorphic Policy
Gradient (HPG), which guarantees optimal policy equivalence under sufficient
conditions, and its extension, Error-Bounded HPG (EBHPG), which balances
computational efficiency and the performance loss induced by aggregation. In
the experiments, we validated the theoretical results and conducted comparative
evaluations against seven algorithms.

*Bach C. Le,Tung V. Dao,Binh T. Nguyen,Hong T. M. Chu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a primal approach to tackle limitations in Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization (WDRO), tightening bounds using exact Lipschitz certificates and introducing a novel attack method called Wasserstein distributional attack (WDA). Extensive evaluations highlight competitive results with tighter robustness certificates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing WDRO techniques lead to loose upper bounds or computational challenges, and there is a need for better and tractable adversarial robustness approaches.

Method: The authors introduce a primal approach using exact Lipschitz certificates to refine WDRO bounds and develop the Wasserstein distributional attack (WDA) to construct more flexible worst-case distributions.

Result: Evaluations reveal that the proposed method achieves robust accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art baselines and produces tighter robustness certificates than existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed framework advances WDRO by addressing computational and accuracy limitations, offering both practical robustness solutions and a novel characterization of adversarial distributions.

Abstract: Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization (WDRO) provides a framework
for adversarial robustness, yet existing methods based on global Lipschitz
continuity or strong duality often yield loose upper bounds or require
prohibitive computation. In this work, we address these limitations by
introducing a primal approach and adopting a notion of exact Lipschitz
certificate to tighten this upper bound of WDRO. In addition, we propose a
novel Wasserstein distributional attack (WDA) that directly constructs a
candidate for the worst-case distribution. Compared to existing point-wise
attack and its variants, our WDA offers greater flexibility in the number and
location of attack points. In particular, by leveraging the piecewise-affine
structure of ReLU networks on their activation cells, our approach results in
an exact tractable characterization of the corresponding WDRO problem.
Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves competitive robust
accuracy against state-of-the-art baselines while offering tighter certificates
than existing methods. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ProtoMM, an SSL framework for modeling multi-modal time-series data, overcoming existing limitations of contrastive learning and improving performance in physiological signal analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SSL methods for multi-modal data often fail to effectively align heterogeneous modalities like ECG, PPG, and EDA due to reliance on contrastive objectives, leading to fragmented embeddings.

Method: The proposed ProtoMM framework leverages a shared prototype dictionary to align multi-modal data in a common embedding space, clustering representations through a prototype-based approach that avoids explicit negative sampling.

Result: ProtoMM achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-modal time-series analysis, providing enhanced interpretability and addressing the limitations of previous methods.

Conclusion: The introduction of a shared prototype structure enables ProtoMM to achieve a more unified and interpretable embedding space for physiological signals, advancing multi-modal SSL capabilities.

Abstract: Modeling multi-modal time-series data is critical for capturing system-level
dynamics, particularly in biosignals where modalities such as ECG, PPG, EDA,
and accelerometry provide complementary perspectives on interconnected
physiological processes. While recent self-supervised learning (SSL) advances
have improved unimodal representation learning, existing multi-modal approaches
often rely on CLIP-style contrastive objectives that overfit to easily aligned
features and misclassify valid cross-modal relationships as negatives,
resulting in fragmented and non-generalizable embeddings. To overcome these
limitations, we propose ProtoMM, a novel SSL framework that introduces a shared
prototype dictionary to anchor heterogeneous modalities in a common embedding
space. By clustering representations around shared prototypes rather than
explicit negative sampling, our method captures complementary information
across modalities and provides a coherent "common language" for physiological
signals. In this work, we focus on developing a Pulse Motion foundation model
with ProtoMM and demonstrate that our approach outperforms contrastive-only and
prior multimodal SSL methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance while
offering improved interpretability of learned features.

*Ruoxing Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents PPOPT, a reinforcement learning algorithm that combines Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with pretraining to improve efficiency and stability in physics-based environments with limited training samples. The policy network integrates pretrained and non-pretrained layers to leverage domain knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning agents often require extensive interaction data to learn effectively, and this incurs high computational costs in complex environments. The paper aims to address this inefficiency by leveraging pretraining to improve learning performance with minimal training samples.

Method: The authors developed a new neural network architecture with a pretrained middle section sandwiched between two fully connected networks. The pretrained section is trained on a physics-based environment with transferable characteristics, allowing the target environment to be learned more efficiently.

Result: PPOPT achieves better performance compared to classic PPO in small sample scenarios, showing improvements in rewards and training stability. However, it underperforms compared to model-based methods like DYNA DDPG but compensates by significantly reducing training time due to its model-free nature.

Conclusion: PPOPT combines pretraining with PPO to provide a more efficient and stable approach to reinforcement learning in resource-constrained scenarios. The method's model-free nature offers reduced computational costs, and its open-source implementation offers applicability for further research and practical use.

Abstract: We introduce PPOPT - Proximal Policy Optimization using Pretraining, a novel,
model-free deep-reinforcement-learning algorithm that leverages pretraining to
achieve high training efficiency and stability on very small training samples
in physics-based environments. Reinforcement learning agents typically rely on
large samples of environment interactions to learn a policy. However, frequent
interactions with a (computer-simulated) environment may incur high
computational costs, especially when the environment is complex. Our main
innovation is a new policy neural network architecture that consists of a
pretrained neural network middle section sandwiched between two fully-connected
networks. Pretraining part of the network on a different environment with
similar physics will help the agent learn the target environment with high
efficiency because it will leverage a general understanding of the
transferrable physics characteristics from the pretraining environment. We
demonstrate that PPOPT outperforms baseline classic PPO on small training
samples both in terms of rewards gained and general training stability. While
PPOPT underperforms against classic model-based methods such as DYNA DDPG, the
model-free nature of PPOPT allows it to train in significantly less time than
its model-based counterparts. Finally, we present our implementation of PPOPT
as open-source software, available at github.com/Davidrxyang/PPOPT.

TL;DR: The paper introduces HeSRN, a novel model for heterogeneous graph representation learning, which achieves better performance with reduced computational cost by addressing semantic entanglement and replacing self-attention with a retention-based encoder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph Transformers struggle with scalability and generalization on real-world heterogeneous graphs due to high computational costs and difficulty handling heterogeneous semantics.

Method: HeSRN uses a slot-aware structure encoder to disentangle node-type semantics and a retention-based encoder to model structural and contextual dependencies efficiently. It also employs a multi-scale heterogeneous retentive encoder for capturing global and local signals.

Result: Experiments on four heterogeneous graph datasets show HeSRN outperforms state-of-the-art models in node classification, achieving higher accuracy with reduced computational complexity.

Conclusion: HeSRN effectively addresses the limitations of traditional Graph Transformers by significantly improving scalability, efficiency, and performance for heterogeneous graph tasks.

Abstract: Graph Transformers have recently achieved remarkable progress in graph
representation learning by capturing long-range dependencies through
self-attention. However, their quadratic computational complexity and inability
to effectively model heterogeneous semantics severely limit their scalability
and generalization on real-world heterogeneous graphs. To address these issues,
we propose HeSRN, a novel Heterogeneous Slot-aware Retentive Network for
efficient and expressive heterogeneous graph representation learning. HeSRN
introduces a slot-aware structure encoder that explicitly disentangles
node-type semantics by projecting heterogeneous features into independent slots
and aligning their distributions through slot normalization and retention-based
fusion, effectively mitigating the semantic entanglement caused by forced
feature-space unification in previous Transformer-based models. Furthermore, we
replace the self-attention mechanism with a retention-based encoder, which
models structural and contextual dependencies in linear time complexity while
maintaining strong expressive power. A heterogeneous retentive encoder is
further employed to jointly capture both local structural signals and global
heterogeneous semantics through multi-scale retention layers. Extensive
experiments on four real-world heterogeneous graph datasets demonstrate that
HeSRN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art heterogeneous graph neural
networks and Graph Transformer baselines on node classification tasks,
achieving superior accuracy with significantly lower computational complexity.

Method: Extends the River-Valley model to include U-shaped (flat) and V-shaped (steep) valleys, and conjectures that Looped-Attn introduces an inductive bias toward V-shaped valleys. SHIFT training framework is proposed to optimize training.

Result: Theoretical insights demonstrate that the landscape inductive bias of Looped-Attn encourages better convergence and learning of complex patterns, and SHIFT improves training efficiency while maintaining performance.

Conclusion: Looped-Attn's recursive structure induces advantageous loss landscape properties, and the proposed SHIFT method makes their training process efficient without compromising on results.

Abstract: While looped transformers (termed as Looped-Attn) often outperform standard
transformers (termed as Single-Attn) on complex reasoning tasks, the
theoretical basis for this advantage remains underexplored. In this paper, we
explain this phenomenon through the lens of loss landscape geometry, inspired
by empirical observations of their distinct dynamics at both sample and Hessian
levels. To formalize this, we extend the River-Valley landscape model by
distinguishing between U-shaped valleys (flat) and V-shaped valleys (steep).
Based on empirical observations, we conjecture that the recursive architecture
of Looped-Attn induces a landscape-level inductive bias towards River-V-Valley.
Theoretical derivations based on this inductive bias guarantee a better loss
convergence along the river due to valley hopping, and further encourage
learning about complex patterns compared to the River-U-Valley induced by
Single-Attn. Building on this insight, we propose SHIFT (Staged HIerarchical
Framework for Progressive Training), a staged training framework that
accelerates the training process of Looped-Attn while achieving comparable
performances.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a stochastic differential equation framework to analyze multi-objective optimization dynamics in Large Language Model interactions, validated through iterative code generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the dynamics and resolving competing objectives in iterative Large Language Model interactions.

Method: A framework based on stochastic differential equations incorporating diffusion terms and interference matrices, applied to code generation with objectives like security, efficiency, and functionality.

Result: Demonstrated strategy-dependent convergence rates (0.33 to 1.29) and predictive accuracy (R2 = 0.74) in code generation analysis.

Conclusion: Dynamic systems analysis is feasible for multi-objective LLM interactions, with code generation presented as a proof-of-concept validation.

Abstract: We introduce a general stochastic differential equation framework for
modelling multiobjective optimization dynamics in iterative Large Language
Model (LLM) interactions. Our framework captures the inherent stochasticity of
LLM responses through explicit diffusion terms and reveals systematic
interference patterns between competing objectives via an interference matrix
formulation. We validate our theoretical framework using iterative code
generation as a proof-of-concept application, analyzing 400 sessions across
security, efficiency, and functionality objectives. Our results demonstrate
strategy-dependent convergence behaviors with rates ranging from 0.33 to 1.29,
and predictive accuracy achieving R2 = 0.74 for balanced approaches. This work
proposes the feasibility of dynamical systems analysis for multi-objective LLM
interactions, with code generation serving as an initial validation domain.

*Khang Ngo,Siamak Ravanbakhsh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Equivariance is critical for learning interatomic potentials, particularly as data, parameters, and compute scale, with equivariant models showing superior performance and better scaling behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the role of equivariance and task symmetry in learning interatomic potentials, particularly regarding scalability in data, parameters, and compute.

Method: An empirical study comparing scaling behaviors of equivariant and non-equivariant architectures in learning interatomic potentials, focusing on their data, parameter, and compute dependencies.

Result: Equivariant architectures outperformed non-equivariant ones and exhibited better scaling, with higher-order equivariant representations offering improved scaling exponents. Optimal scaling of data and model size in training is noted for optimal compute usage.

Conclusion: Symmetry and equivariance are crucial inductive biases in machine learning tasks like interatomic potential learning. These biases significantly improve scaling efficiency, challenging the notion that models can fully discover such biases without explicit design.

Abstract: We present an empirical study in the geometric task of learning interatomic
potentials, which shows equivariance matters even more at larger scales; we
show a clear power-law scaling behaviour with respect to data, parameters and
compute with ``architecture-dependent exponents''. In particular, we observe
that equivariant architectures, which leverage task symmetry, scale better than
non-equivariant models. Moreover, among equivariant architectures, higher-order
representations translate to better scaling exponents. Our analysis also
suggests that for compute-optimal training, the data and model sizes should
scale in tandem regardless of the architecture. At a high level, these results
suggest that, contrary to common belief, we should not leave it to the model to
discover fundamental inductive biases such as symmetry, especially as we scale,
because they change the inherent difficulty of the task and its scaling laws.

### [533] [Adversarial Attacks on Downstream Weather Forecasting Models: Application to Tropical Cyclone Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10140)
*Yue Deng,Francisco Santos,Pang-Ning Tan,Lifeng Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Cyc-Attack, a method for creating adversarial attacks on deep learning weather forecasting models, specifically targeting tropical cyclone trajectory predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify and address vulnerabilities in deep learning weather forecasting models, particularly relating to adversarial attacks that manipulate upstream inputs to influence downstream tropical cyclone trajectory predictions.

Method: The authors propose Cyc-Attack, which uses a surrogate model for gradient-based attacks, a skewness-aware loss function with kernel dilation to manage class imbalance, and gradient weighting with regularization to maintain realistic adversarial forecasts.

Result: Cyc-Attack successfully perturbs upstream forecasts, steering tropical cyclone trajectory predictions towards targeted outcomes while maintaining physical plausibility and avoiding detection.

Conclusion: The proposed Cyc-Attack demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of adversarial attacks on deep learning weather forecasting models, thereby highlighting the need for enhanced robustness in such systems.

Abstract: Deep learning based weather forecasting (DLWF) models leverage past weather
observations to generate future forecasts, supporting a wide range of
downstream tasks, including tropical cyclone (TC) trajectory prediction. In
this paper, we investigate their vulnerability to adversarial attacks, where
subtle perturbations to the upstream weather forecasts can alter the downstream
TC trajectory predictions. Although research on adversarial attacks in DLWF
models has grown recently, generating perturbed upstream forecasts that
reliably steer downstream output toward attacker-specified trajectories remains
a challenge. First, conventional TC detection systems are opaque,
non-differentiable black boxes, making standard gradient-based attacks
infeasible. Second, the extreme rarity of TC events leads to severe class
imbalance problem, making it difficult to develop efficient attack methods that
will produce the attacker's target trajectories. Furthermore, maintaining
physical consistency in adversarially generated forecasts presents another
significant challenge. To overcome these limitations, we propose Cyc-Attack, a
novel method that perturbs the upstream forecasts of DLWF models to generate
adversarial trajectories. First, we pre-train a differentiable surrogate model
to approximate the TC detector's output, enabling the construction of
gradient-based attacks. Cyc-Attack also employs skewness-aware loss function
with kernel dilation strategy to address the imbalance problem. Finally, a
distance-based gradient weighting scheme and regularization are used to
constrain the perturbations and eliminate spurious trajectories to ensure the
adversarial forecasts are realistic and not easily detectable.

*Ziyi Wei,Huaiyang Zhong,Xiaocheng Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces exploration-free algorithms for multi-group mean estimation, improving subgaussian variance concentration results, providing tighter regret bounds, and extending the framework to contextual bandit settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to optimize sampling allocation across multiple groups to enhance multi-group mean estimation, diverging from classical multi-armed bandit approaches that focus on identifying and exploiting the best arm.

Method: The authors develop non-adaptive and adaptive exploration-free algorithms, utilizing advanced variance concentration techniques and extending the approach to contextual bandit settings.

Result: The proposed algorithms yield sharper guarantees for strictly subgaussian distributions, achieve tighter regret bounds, and successfully leverage side information in contextual settings.

Conclusion: Exploration-free allocation emerges as a robust and efficient method for accurate multi-group mean estimation with potential applications in personalization and experimental design.

Abstract: We address the problem of multi-group mean estimation, which seeks to
allocate a finite sampling budget across multiple groups to obtain uniformly
accurate estimates of their means. Unlike classical multi-armed bandits, whose
objective is to minimize regret by identifying and exploiting the best arm, the
optimal allocation in this setting requires sampling every group on the order
of $\Theta(T)$ times. This fundamental distinction makes exploration-free
algorithms both natural and effective. Our work makes three contributions.
First, we strengthen the existing results on subgaussian variance concentration
using the Hanson-Wright inequality and identify a class of strictly subgaussian
distributions that yield sharper guarantees. Second, we design exploration-free
non-adaptive and adaptive algorithms, and we establish tighter regret bounds
than the existing results. Third, we extend the framework to contextual bandit
settings, an underexplored direction, and propose algorithms that leverage side
information with provable guarantees. Overall, these results position
exploration-free allocation as a principled and efficient approach to
multi-group mean estimation, with potential applications in experimental
design, personalization, and other domains requiring accurate multi-group
inference.

*ChengAo Shen,Ziming Zhao,Hanghang Tong,Dongjin Song,Dongsheng Luo,Qingsong Wen,Jingchao Ni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SVTime introduces a lightweight and cost-effective model for long-term time series forecasting, achieving performance comparable to large vision models with drastically fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the sustainability challenges posed by energy-intensive large models for time series analysis, providing a resource-efficient alternative for tasks like forecasting.

Method: The authors identify inductive biases in large vision model forecasters and incorporate them into compact models using specially designed linear layers and constraint functions.

Result: SVTime significantly outperforms existing lightweight models and performs on par with large models while using 10^3 fewer parameters, validating its efficiency for low-resource deployments.

Conclusion: SVTime offers a sustainable and practical solution for time series forecasting, making advanced modeling accessible to smaller businesses and resource-limited users without compromising performance.

Abstract: Time series AI is crucial for analyzing dynamic web content, driving a surge
of pre-trained large models known for their strong knowledge encoding and
transfer capabilities across diverse tasks. However, given their
energy-intensive training, inference, and hardware demands, using large models
as a one-fits-all solution raises serious concerns about carbon footprint and
sustainability. For a specific task, a compact yet specialized, high-performing
model may be more practical and affordable, especially for resource-constrained
users such as small businesses. This motivates the question: Can we build
cost-effective lightweight models with large-model-like performance on core
tasks such as forecasting? This paper addresses this question by introducing
SVTime, a novel Small model inspired by large Vision model (LVM) forecasters
for long-term Time series forecasting (LTSF). Recently, LVMs have been shown as
powerful tools for LTSF. We identify a set of key inductive biases of LVM
forecasters -- analogous to the "physics" governing their behaviors in LTSF --
and design small models that encode these biases through meticulously crafted
linear layers and constraint functions. Across 21 baselines spanning
lightweight, complex, and pre-trained large models on 8 benchmark datasets,
SVTime outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) lightweight models and rivals large
models with 10^3 fewer parameters than LVMs, while enabling efficient training
and inference in low-resource settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of improving pre-execution safety in LLM systems by introducing three innovations: a data synthesis engine (AuraGen), a foundational guardrail model (Safiron), and a comprehensive benchmark (Pre-Exec Bench).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing guardrails for large language model (LLM) agents often operate post-execution, which is challenging to scale and limits control at the planning stage where the harm can be preempted.

Method: The paper introduces AuraGen for data creation, which synthesizes trajectories, injects labeled risks, and uses an automated reward model. It also proposes Safiron, a foundational model combining a cross-planner adapter and a guardian model, trained in two stages, to address pre-execution risks. Lastly, they release Pre-Exec Bench, a benchmark for assessments in human-verified, diverse setups.

Result: Experiments reveal significant improvements in pre-execution safety using the proposed Safiron model, evaluated using Pre-Exec Bench, showcasing its consistency in detecting and categorizing risks across scenarios.

Conclusion: By addressing critical gaps in data generation, modeling, and evaluation, this paper offers a robust approach to safer multi-step planning in LLM systems, reducing risks prior to task execution.

Abstract: While LLM agents can plan multi-step tasks, intervening at the planning
stage-before any action is executed-is often the safest way to prevent harm,
since certain risks can lead to severe consequences once carried out. However,
existing guardrails mostly operate post-execution, which is difficult to scale
and leaves little room for controllable supervision at the plan level. To
address this challenge, we highlight three critical gaps in current research:
data gap, model gap, and evaluation gap. To close the data gap, we introduce
AuraGen, a controllable engine that (i) synthesizes benign trajectories, (ii)
injects category-labeled risks with calibrated difficulty, and (iii) filters
outputs via an automated reward model, producing large and reliable corpora for
pre-execution safety. To close the guardian model gap, we propose a
foundational guardrail Safiron, combining a cross-planner adapter with a
compact guardian model. The adapter unifies different input formats, while
Safiron flags risky cases, assigns risk types, and generates rationales;
trained in two stages with a broadly explored data recipe, Safiron achieves
robust transfer across settings. To close the evaluation gap, we release
Pre-Exec Bench, a realistic benchmark covering diverse tools and branching
trajectories, which measures detection, fine-grained categorization,
explanation, and cross-planner generalization in human-verified scenarios.
Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent gains of the proposed guardrail
over strong baselines on Pre-Exec Bench, and ablations further distill
actionable practices, providing a practical template for safer agentic systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a PAC-Bayesian generalization bound tailored for reinforcement learning, addressing Markov dependencies and validating it with an algorithm, PB-SAC, that performs effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the lack of generalization guarantees in reinforcement learning caused by the sequential and dependent nature of the data.

Method: They derive a PAC-Bayesian generalization bound that incorporates the mixing time of Markov chains to account for dependencies in reinforcement learning data. They also propose PB-SAC, an algorithm that uses the bound to guide exploration during training.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that PB-SAC provides meaningful confidence certificates while delivering competitive performance across continuous control tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed bound overcomes challenges in classical generalization bounds, offering practical utility for modern reinforcement learning with non-vacuous guarantees and effective exploration guidance.

Abstract: We derive a novel PAC-Bayesian generalization bound for reinforcement
learning that explicitly accounts for Markov dependencies in the data, through
the chain's mixing time. This contributes to overcoming challenges in obtaining
generalization guarantees for reinforcement learning, where the sequential
nature of data breaks the independence assumptions underlying classical bounds.
Our bound provides non-vacuous certificates for modern off-policy algorithms
like Soft Actor-Critic. We demonstrate the bound's practical utility through
PB-SAC, a novel algorithm that optimizes the bound during training to guide
exploration. Experiments across continuous control tasks show that our approach
provides meaningful confidence certificates while maintaining competitive
performance.

*Richard John,Yunrui Qiu,Lukas Herron,Pratyush Tiwary*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces D-SPIB, a joint model combining time-lagged information bottleneck and diffusion models for molecular tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data collection in molecular science is expensive and rare events are significant; thus, there is a need to compress high-dimensional representations for better downstream utility.

Method: D-SPIB integrates a time-lagged information bottleneck with a diffusion model into a single training framework, balancing representation learning and generative goals.

Result: D-SPIB benchmarks effectively on multiple molecular tasks, showing its ability to explore physical conditions beyond training data.

Conclusion: The proposed approach demonstrates a flexible and coherent representation learning method applicable to molecular science, incorporating diverse temperature information from simulations.

Abstract: Generative modeling becomes increasingly data-intensive in high-dimensional
spaces. In molecular science, where data collection is expensive and important
events are rare, compression to lower-dimensional manifolds is especially
important for various downstream tasks, including generation. We combine a
time-lagged information bottleneck designed to characterize molecular important
representations and a diffusion model in one joint training objective. The
resulting protocol, which we term Diffusive State Predictive Information
Bottleneck (D-SPIB), enables the balancing of representation learning and
generation aims in one flexible architecture. Additionally, the model is
capable of combining temperature information from different molecular
simulation trajectories to learn a coherent and useful internal representation
of thermodynamics. We benchmark D-SPIB on multiple molecular tasks and showcase
its potential for exploring physical conditions outside the training set.

*Jiazheng Sun,Weixin Wang,Pan Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper provides a unified algorithmic framework for ensemble sampling in nonlinear contextual bandits, introduces frequentist regret bounds for generalized linear and neural bandit algorithms, and demonstrates their theoretical and practical effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nonlinear contextual bandits pose challenges in exploration due to the complexity of reward models, creating a need for robust and theoretically sound algorithms for randomized exploration.

Method: The paper introduces two ensemble sampling methods: Generalized Linear Ensemble Sampling (GLM-ES) and Neural Ensemble Sampling (Neural-ES), which use multiple estimators of reward model parameters via maximum likelihood estimation on perturbed data.

Result: Theoretical frequentist regret bounds are proven for GLM-ES and Neural-ES, matching state-of-the-art results. Practical versions of these algorithms without fixed-time assumptions are developed and empirically evaluated to show competitive performance.

Conclusion: Ensemble sampling is established as a theoretically sound and practical approach for exploration in nonlinear contextual bandits.

Abstract: We provide a unified algorithmic framework for ensemble sampling in nonlinear
contextual bandits and develop corresponding regret bounds for two most common
nonlinear contextual bandit settings: Generalized Linear Ensemble Sampling
(\texttt{GLM-ES}) for generalized linear bandits and Neural Ensemble Sampling
(\texttt{Neural-ES}) for neural contextual bandits. Both methods maintain
multiple estimators for the reward model parameters via maximum likelihood
estimation on randomly perturbed data. We prove high-probability frequentist
regret bounds of $\mathcal{O}(d^{3/2} \sqrt{T} + d^{9/2})$ for \texttt{GLM-ES}
and $\mathcal{O}(\widetilde{d} \sqrt{T})$ for \texttt{Neural-ES}, where $d$ is
the dimension of feature vectors, $\widetilde{d}$ is the effective dimension of
a neural tangent kernel matrix, and $T$ is the number of rounds. These regret
bounds match the state-of-the-art results of randomized exploration algorithms
in nonlinear contextual bandit settings. In the theoretical analysis, we
introduce techniques that address challenges specific to nonlinear models.
Practically, we remove fixed-time horizon assumptions by developing anytime
versions of our algorithms, suitable when $T$ is unknown. Finally, we
empirically evaluate \texttt{GLM-ES}, \texttt{Neural-ES}, and their anytime
variants, demonstrating strong performance. Overall, our results establish
ensemble sampling as a provable and practical randomized exploration approach
for nonlinear contextual bandits.

TL;DR: This paper enhances the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) for high-resolution ocean prediction by integrating temporal Fourier modes, demonstrating improved stability and physical fidelity in long-term forecasts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges remain in neural operator-based ocean forecasting, particularly in maintaining prediction stability and adherence to physical laws for high-frequency processes.

Method: The study modifies the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) into FNOtD by integrating the dispersion relation into its framework to entangle space and time during the training process.

Result: FNOtD achieved better stability, adherence to physical dynamics, and competitive predictive skill compared to traditional numerical ocean models, with reduced computational costs.

Conclusion: Incorporating temporal Fourier modes within neural operators significantly improves long-term prediction and physical consistency for ocean dynamics, marking a step forward in ocean forecasting applications.

Abstract: Neural operators are becoming the default tools to learn solutions to
governing partial differential equations (PDEs) in weather and ocean
forecasting applications. Despite early promising achievements, significant
challenges remain, including long-term prediction stability and adherence to
physical laws, particularly for high-frequency processes. In this paper, we
take a step toward addressing these challenges in high-resolution ocean
prediction by incorporating temporal Fourier modes, demonstrating how this
modification enhances physical fidelity. This study compares the standard
Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) with its variant, FNOtD, which has been modified
to internalize the dispersion relation while learning the solution operator for
ocean PDEs. The results demonstrate that entangling space and time in the
training of integral kernels enables the model to capture multiscale wave
propagation and effectively learn ocean dynamics. FNOtD substantially improves
long-term prediction stability and consistency with underlying physical
dynamics in challenging high-frequency settings compared to the standard FNO.
It also provides competitive predictive skill relative to a state-of-the-art
numerical ocean model, while requiring significantly lower computational cost.

*Aadithya Srikanth,Mudit Gaur,Vaneet Aggarwal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents the first theoretical framework for discrete-state diffusion models, providing a sample complexity bound and structured insights into their training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrete-state diffusion models are crucial for text, sequences, and combinatorial structures but lack theoretical understanding compared to continuous-state models.

Method: Develops a theoretical framework focusing on sample complexity, with a structured decomposition of score estimation error components.

Result: Establishes the first sample complexity bound for discrete-state diffusion models as $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$.

Conclusion: This work bridges a key theoretical gap, emphasizing the tractability and efficiency of discrete-state diffusion models for practical applications.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in generating
high-dimensional samples across domains such as vision, language, and the
sciences. Although continuous-state diffusion models have been extensively
studied both empirically and theoretically, discrete-state diffusion models,
essential for applications involving text, sequences, and combinatorial
structures, remain significantly less understood from a theoretical standpoint.
In particular, all existing analyses of discrete-state models assume score
estimation error bounds without studying sample complexity results. In this
work, we present a principled theoretical framework for discrete-state
diffusion, providing the first sample complexity bound of
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$. Our structured decomposition of the
score estimation error into statistical, approximation, optimization, and
clipping components offers critical insights into how discrete-state models can
be trained efficiently. This analysis addresses a fundamental gap in the
literature and establishes the theoretical tractability and practical relevance
of discrete-state diffusion models.

*Lianghuan Huang,Yingshan Chang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the relationship between decodability and causality in vision transformers (ViTs) used for object counting, finding systematic mismatches between the two concepts and highlighting their complementary roles in understanding neural network representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand how neural network components contribute to predictions by disentangling decodability and causality, especially in the context of vision transformers and object counting.

Method: The authors use activation patching to test causal impacts by swapping activations in clean and corrupted image pairs, and they train linear probes to measure the decodability of count information across different layers of ViTs.

Result: They find mismatches between decodability and causality: middle-layer tokens strongly influence output but are weakly decodable, while final-layer tokens support decoding but lack causal impact. Additionally, the CLS token becomes decodable mid-layer and gains causality only later.

Conclusion: Decodability and causality provide complementary insights, reflecting the difference between information presence and functional usage, and their divergence can shed light on the latent computational mechanisms in neural networks.

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability seeks to uncover how internal components of
neural networks give rise to predictions. A persistent challenge, however, is
disentangling two often conflated notions: decodability--the recoverability of
information from hidden states--and causality--the extent to which those states
functionally influence outputs. In this work, we investigate their relationship
in vision transformers (ViTs) fine-tuned for object counting. Using activation
patching, we test the causal role of spatial and CLS tokens by transplanting
activations across clean-corrupted image pairs. In parallel, we train linear
probes to assess the decodability of count information at different depths. Our
results reveal systematic mismatches: middle-layer object tokens exert strong
causal influence despite being weakly decodable, whereas final-layer object
tokens support accurate decoding yet are functionally inert. Similarly, the CLS
token becomes decodable in mid-layers but only acquires causal power in the
final layers. These findings highlight that decodability and causality reflect
complementary dimensions of representation--what information is present versus
what is used--and that their divergence can expose hidden computational
circuits.

*Mahmoud Abdelghafar,Maryam Aliakbarpour,Chris Jermaine*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces "gradient uniqueness," a privacy auditing metric that assesses the risk of disclosing information through published machine learning models, achieving privacy without compromising utility significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the concern of private information leakage through the publication of machine learning models, even when intuitively less risky than dataset disclosure.

Method: The authors propose a novel metric called gradient uniqueness, derived from an information disclosure upper bound, to measure disclosure risk. This metric is general and applicable across different models, datasets, and attacker strategies.

Result: It is demonstrated that monitoring gradient uniqueness as a defense achieves privacy levels comparable to traditional methods like DP-SGD, while maintaining superior testing accuracy.

Conclusion: Gradient uniqueness offers a practical and principled method for privacy auditing in machine learning, balancing disclosure risk with utility.

Abstract: Disclosing private information via publication of a machine learning model is
often a concern. Intuitively, publishing a learned model should be less risky
than publishing a dataset. But how much risk is there? In this paper, we
present a principled disclosure metric called \emph{gradient uniqueness} that
is derived from an upper bound on the amount of information disclosure from
publishing a learned model. Gradient uniqueness provides an intuitive way to
perform privacy auditing. The mathematical derivation of gradient uniqueness is
general, and does not make any assumption on the model architecture, dataset
type, or the strategy of an attacker. We examine a simple defense based on
monitoring gradient uniqueness, and find that it achieves privacy comparable to
classical methods such as DP-SGD, while being substantially better in terms of
(utility) testing accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper establishes a theoretical framework redefining redundancy as central to information organization, encompassing classical measures and revealing its equilibrium in structured systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To revisit the concept of redundancy traditionally seen as inefficiency, and establish it as a fundamental feature crucial for information stability and learning in finite systems.

Method: Develop a geometric framework to redefine redundancy, unify classical measures like mutual information, and demonstrate the principle through experiments on masked autoencoders.

Result: Redundancy exhibits geometric bounds, with an optimal equilibrium balancing structure and coupling. Experiments show masked autoencoders converge to stable redundancy levels that maximize generalization.

Conclusion: Redundancy is a calculable property bridging the asymptotic nature of communication theory and the structured, finite realm of real-world learning systems.

Abstract: We present a theoretical framework that extends classical information theory
to finite and structured systems by redefining redundancy as a fundamental
property of information organization rather than inefficiency. In this
framework, redundancy is expressed as a general family of informational
divergences that unifies multiple classical measures, such as mutual
information, chi-squared dependence, and spectral redundancy, under a single
geometric principle. This reveals that these traditional quantities are not
isolated heuristics but projections of a shared redundancy geometry. The theory
further predicts that redundancy is bounded both above and below, giving rise
to an optimal equilibrium that balances over-compression (loss of structure)
and over-coupling (collapse). While classical communication theory favors
minimal redundancy for transmission efficiency, finite and structured systems,
such as those underlying real-world learning, achieve maximal stability and
generalization near this equilibrium. Experiments with masked autoencoders are
used to illustrate and verify this principle: the model exhibits a stable
redundancy level where generalization peaks. Together, these results establish
redundancy as a measurable and tunable quantity that bridges the asymptotic
world of communication and the finite world of learning.

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'temporal lifting,' a smooth mapping for adaptive temporal reparametrization in continuous-time dynamical systems to address near-singular behaviors while preserving conservation laws.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To handle near-singular behaviors in dynamical systems and stabilize machine learning dynamics in stiff or turbulent processes.

Method: The proposed 'temporal lifting' uses a smooth monotone mapping $t \mapsto \tau(t)$ to regularize flows, ensuring trajectories become globally smooth.

Result: Temporal lifting ensures global smoothness in trajectories, such as in the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, and enhances stability in machine-learning dynamics.

Conclusion: The framework bridges regularity theory with machine-learning techniques, offering a stabilization tool for AI systems handling complex processes.

Abstract: We present a latent-space formulation of adaptive temporal reparametrization
for continuous-time dynamical systems. The method, called *temporal lifting*,
introduces a smooth monotone mapping $t \mapsto \tau(t)$ that regularizes
near-singular behavior of the underlying flow while preserving its conservation
laws. In the lifted coordinate, trajectories such as those of the
incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on the torus $\mathbb{T}^3$ become
globally smooth. From the standpoint of machine-learning dynamics, temporal
lifting acts as a continuous-time normalization or time-warping operator that
can stabilize physics-informed neural networks and other latent-flow
architectures used in AI systems. The framework links analytic regularity
theory with representation-learning methods for stiff or turbulent processes.

*Xiaoyun Zhang,Xiaojian Yuan,Di Huang,Wang You,Chen Hu,Jingqing Ruan,Kejiang Chen,Xing Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses policy entropy collapse in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) by proposing Adaptive Entropy Regularization (AER).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the problem of policy entropy collapse in RLVR, which hampers reasoning capability and task exploration due to overly deterministic behaviors.

Method: The authors introduce Adaptive Entropy Regularization (AER), featuring difficulty-aware coefficient allocation, initial-anchored target entropy, and dynamic global coefficient adjustment to balance exploration and exploitation adaptively.

Result: Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrated that AER consistently outperformed baselines, improving both the reasoning accuracy of LLMs and their exploration capabilities.

Conclusion: AER is a significant improvement for stabilizing entropy in RLVR, offering a dynamic solution that enhances both reasoning accuracy and task exploration across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Reasoning ability has become a defining capability of Large Language Models
(LLMs), with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) emerging as
a key paradigm to enhance it. However, RLVR training often suffers from policy
entropy collapse, where the policy becomes overly deterministic, hindering
exploration and limiting reasoning performance. While entropy regularization is
a common remedy, its effectiveness is highly sensitive to the fixed
coefficient, making it unstable across tasks and models. In this work, we
revisit entropy regularization in RLVR and argue that its potential has been
largely underestimated. Our analysis shows that (i) tasks of varying difficulty
demand distinct exploration intensities, and (ii) balanced exploration may
require the policy entropy to be maintained within a moderate range below its
initial level. Therefore, we propose Adaptive Entropy Regularization (AER)--a
framework that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation via three
components: difficulty-aware coefficient allocation, initial-anchored target
entropy, and dynamic global coefficient adjustment. Experiments on multiple
mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that AER consistently outperforms
baselines, improving both reasoning accuracy and exploration capability.

*Hongkai Zheng,Austin Wang,Zihui Wu,Zhengyu Huang,Ricardo Baptista,Yisong Yue*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Blade, a method for derivative-free Bayesian inversion using diffusion-based priors and particle ensembles, achieving strong performance in nonlinear inverse problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for accurate and computationally feasible derivative-free Bayesian inversion methods in science and engineering applications, especially for problems with challenging forward models.

Method: Blade combines diffusion model-based data-driven priors with an ensemble of interacting particles for derivative-free Bayesian inversion. A theoretical non-asymptotic convergence analysis is provided.

Result: Blade demonstrates superior empirical performance compared to existing methods in various inverse problems, including challenging nonlinear cases such as fluid dynamics.

Conclusion: Blade is a promising approach for derivative-free Bayesian inversion, offering accuracy, calibration, and applicability in a range of complex inverse problems.

Abstract: Derivative-free Bayesian inversion is an important task in many science and
engineering applications, particularly when computing the forward model
derivative is computationally and practically challenging. In this paper, we
introduce Blade, which can produce accurate and well-calibrated posteriors for
Bayesian inversion using an ensemble of interacting particles. Blade leverages
powerful data-driven priors based on diffusion models, and can handle nonlinear
forward models that permit only black-box access (i.e., derivative-free).
Theoretically, we establish a non-asymptotic convergence analysis to
characterize the effects of forward model and prior estimation errors.
Empirically, Blade achieves superior performance compared to existing
derivative-free Bayesian inversion methods on various inverse problems,
including challenging highly nonlinear fluid dynamics.

### [548] [On the Optimal Representation Efficiency of Barlow Twins: An Information-Geometric Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10980)
*Di Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel geometric framework to understand and compare self-supervised learning (SSL) based on representation efficiency. It analyzes the Barlow Twins SSL method using this framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is no unified theoretical framework to assess and compare SSL paradigms comprehensively. The research aims to fill this gap by introducing a measure for representation efficiency.

Method: The paper defines representation efficiency as the ratio of intrinsic to ambient dimension informed by Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) properties. Using theoretical analysis, it evaluates the Barlow Twins SSL method and its impact on representation efficiency.

Result: Under natural assumptions, Barlow Twins achieves optimal representation efficiency ($
\eta = 1$) by changing the cross-correlation matrix toward an identity matrix, leading to isotropic behavior in FIM.

Conclusion: This study offers a rigorous theoretical foundation for Barlow Twins, highlighting its optimal representation efficiency and introduces a geometry-based framework for analyzing SSL methods.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved remarkable success by learning
meaningful representations without labeled data. However, a unified theoretical
framework for understanding and comparing the efficiency of different SSL
paradigms remains elusive. In this paper, we introduce a novel
information-geometric framework to quantify representation efficiency. We
define representation efficiency $\eta$ as the ratio between the effective
intrinsic dimension of the learned representation space and its ambient
dimension, where the effective dimension is derived from the spectral
properties of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) on the statistical manifold
induced by the encoder. Within this framework, we present a theoretical
analysis of the Barlow Twins method. Under specific but natural assumptions, we
prove that Barlow Twins achieves optimal representation efficiency ($\eta = 1$)
by driving the cross-correlation matrix of representations towards the identity
matrix, which in turn induces an isotropic FIM. This work provides a rigorous
theoretical foundation for understanding the effectiveness of Barlow Twins and
offers a new geometric perspective for analyzing SSL algorithms.

### [550] [CALM: A Causal Analysis Language Model for Tabular Data in Complex Systems with Local Scores, Conditional Independence Tests, and Relation Attributes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09846)
*Zhenjiang Fan,Zengyi Qin,Yuanning Zheng,Bo Xiong,Summer Han*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CALM, a causal analysis language model that processes tabular data to improve on existing causal discovery methods, achieving over 91% accuracy on simulations and successful application to biological datasets like Hepatitis C.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Causal discovery is critical in areas like biology where experiments are often impractical. Current methods face challenges like linearity assumptions, inefficiency, and faithfulness violations. Large language models (LLMs) have reasoning capabilities but are text-focused, leaving a gap for tabular causal data analysis.

Method: The authors propose CALM, a language model with a Mamba-based architecture that captures causal patterns in tabular data through local causal scores, independence tests, and relational attributes. It is trained on synthetic and real-world biological datasets to ensure generalizability.

Result: CALM achieves over 91% accuracy in simulation studies and successfully identifies causal factors in Hepatitis C progression. It outperforms existing methods in both linear and nonlinear scenarios.

Conclusion: CALM is a novel, robust solution for generalizable causal discovery in tabular data. By adapting language models to non-text data, it advances the field with high accuracy and real-world applicability.

Abstract: Causal discovery from observational data is fundamental to scientific fields
like biology, where controlled experiments are often impractical. However,
existing methods, including constraint-based (e.g., PC, causalMGM) and
score-based approaches (e.g., NOTEARS), face significant limitations. These
include an inability to resolve causal direction, restrictions to linear
associations, sensitivity to violations of the faithfulness assumption, and
inefficiency in searching vast hypothesis spaces. While large language models
(LLMs) offer powerful reasoning capabilities, their application is hindered by
a fundamental discrepancy: they are designed for text, while most causal data
is tabular. To address these challenges, we introduce CALM, a novel causal
analysis language model specifically designed for tabular data in complex
systems. CALM leverages a Mamba-based architecture to classify causal patterns
from pairwise variable relationships. It integrates a comprehensive suite of
evidence, including local causal scores, conditional independence tests, and
relational attributes, to capture a wide spectrum of linear, nonlinear, and
conditional causal mechanisms. Trained on a diverse corpus of synthetic data
(from linear, mixed, and nonlinear models) and 10 real-world biological
datasets with rigorously validated causal relationships, our model ensures
robustness and generalizability. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that CALM
significantly outperforms existing methods in both simulation studies,
achieving over 91% accuracy, and in a real-world application identifying causal
factors in Hepatitis C virus progression. This work represents a significant
step towards accurate and generalizable causal discovery by successfully
adapting the pattern recognition capabilities of language models to the
intricacies of tabular data.

*Shivam Patel,Neharika Jali,Ankur Mallick,Gauri Joshi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProxRouter proposes a method to enhance large language model query routing by improving robustness to outlier queries through an aggregation mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency and poor generalization of parametric and nonparametric routing methods, especially in handling outlier queries in AI platforms.

Method: Introduces ProxRouter, which uses an exponentially tilted aggregation mechanism to balance bias and variance in nonparametric routers.

Result: ProxRouter improves the routing for outliers while maintaining inlier performance, with minimal computational and maintenance overhead.

Conclusion: A robust and efficient solution for query routing in LLMs, enhancing performance without increasing complexity significantly.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) query routers are critical to modern AI platforms
as they seek to improve efficiency by assigning inference queries to accurate,
yet low-cost models. Parametric routers typically use trained neural networks
for LLM selection but suffer from retraining and maintenance overheads.
Nonparametric routers are training-free, instead estimating LLM accuracy and
cost via similarity between encodings of the input query and training set
queries. However, like their parametric counterparts, nonparametric routers
struggle to generalize to outlier queries, an issue exacerbated by limited
diversity in training sets which are costly to expand and difficult to keep
current with ever-evolving use cases. We propose ProxRouter, which applies an
exponentially tilted aggregation mechanism to balance bias and variance in
nonparametric routers, improving their robustness to outliers. Experiments show
ProxRouter enhances outlier routing while preserving inlier performance with
minimal overhead.

*Sanjari Srivastava,Gang Li,Cheng Chang,Rishu Garg,Manpreet Kaur,Charlene Y. Lee,Yuezhang Li,Yining Mao,Ignacio Cases,Yanan Xie,Peng Qi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces WARC-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating web agents on complex subtasks, revealing challenges and potential improvements via training methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing web navigation models struggle to perform short-horizon subtasks critical for real-world usability. Current benchmarks lack rigorous evaluation of these capabilities.

Method: The authors developed WARC-Bench with 438 tasks using archived dynamic webpages. They evaluated models using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR).

Result: State-of-the-art models achieved a 64.8% success rate on WARC-Bench. SFT improved open-source models to 48.8%, and SFT combined with RLVR raised performance to 52.8%.

Conclusion: Mastery of web subtasks is essential for robust agent navigation. Current benchmarks fall short in evaluating this area; WARC-Bench sets a stronger standard.

Abstract: Training web agents to navigate complex, real-world websites requires them to
master $\textit{subtasks}$ - short-horizon interactions on multiple UI
components (e.g., choosing the correct date in a date picker, or scrolling in a
container to extract information). We introduce WARC-Bench (Web Archive
Benchmark), a novel web navigation benchmark featuring 438 tasks designed to
evaluate multimodal AI agents on subtasks. WARC-Bench enables sandboxed
interactions with dynamic and realistic webpages using Web ARChive files. We
show that WARC-Bench is challenging for leading computer-use models, with the
highest observed success rate being 64.8%. To improve open source models on
subtask, we explore two common training techniques: supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). Experiments
show that SFT models obtain a 48.8% success rate on the benchmark. Training
with RLVR over SFT checkpoints, even in data-scarce settings, improves the
score to 52.8% on WARC-Bench, outperforming many frontier models. Our analysis
concludes that mastering these subtasks is essential for robust web planning
and navigation, and is a capability not extensively evaluated by existing
benchmarks.

*Xuan Tang,Han Zhang,Yuan Cao,Difan Zou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper theoretically analyzes the impact of batch size and weight decay on Adam's generalization, highlighting differences between Adam and AdamW in over-parameterized CNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the discrepancy in convergence and generalization performance between the full-batch and stochastic versions of Adam used in practice.

Method: The analysis is conducted on two-layer over-parameterized CNNs with image data, focusing on batch size influence and weight decay effects.

Result: Adam and AdamW converge to poor test error solutions with improper weight decay, but mini-batch variants can achieve near-zero test error. Adam has a smaller effective weight decay bound than AdamW.

Conclusion: Batch size and proper weight decay are critical for optimizing Adam's generalization; Adam requires more precise weight decay tuning compared to AdamW.

Abstract: Adam is a popular and widely used adaptive gradient method in deep learning,
which has also received tremendous focus in theoretical research. However, most
existing theoretical work primarily analyzes its full-batch version, which
differs fundamentally from the stochastic variant used in practice. Unlike SGD,
stochastic Adam does not converge to its full-batch counterpart even with
infinitesimal learning rates. We present the first theoretical characterization
of how batch size affects Adam's generalization, analyzing two-layer
over-parameterized CNNs on image data. Our results reveal that while both Adam
and AdamW with proper weight decay $\lambda$ converge to poor test error
solutions, their mini-batch variants can achieve near-zero test error. We
further prove Adam has a strictly smaller effective weight decay bound than
AdamW, theoretically explaining why Adam requires more sensitive $\lambda$
tuning. Extensive experiments validate our findings, demonstrating the critical
role of batch size and weight decay in Adam's generalization performance.

### [554] [TAWRMAC: A Novel Dynamic Graph Representation Learning Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09884)
*Soheila Farokhi,Xiaojun Qi,Hamid Karimi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces TAWRMAC, a novel framework for continuous-time dynamic graph learning, addressing challenges like embedding staleness and lack of structural dynamics capture. Experiments show superior results in link prediction and node classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to address shortcomings in current dynamic graph representation learning methods—namely embedding staleness, inadequate contextual awareness, and limited structural dynamics capture.

Method: The proposed TAWRMAC framework leverages Temporal Anonymous Walks with Restart, Memory Augmentation, and Neighbor Co-occurrence embedding to stabilize embeddings, enhance contextual representation, and better distinguish structural dynamics in evolving graphs.

Result: TAWRMAC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in tasks like dynamic link prediction and node classification using multiple datasets and under transductive and inductive settings.

Conclusion: TAWRMAC provides stable, generalizable, and context-aware embeddings, advancing the field of continuous-time dynamic graph learning, with results validated across benchmark datasets and various settings.

Abstract: Dynamic graph representation learning has become essential for analyzing
evolving networks in domains such as social network analysis, recommendation
systems, and traffic analysis. However, existing continuous-time methods face
three key challenges: (1) some methods depend solely on node-specific memory
without effectively incorporating information from neighboring nodes, resulting
in embedding staleness; (2) most fail to explicitly capture correlations
between node neighborhoods, limiting contextual awareness; and (3) many fail to
fully capture the structural dynamics of evolving graphs, especially in absence
of rich link attributes. To address these limitations, we introduce TAWRMAC-a
novel framework that integrates Temporal Anonymous Walks with Restart, Memory
Augmentation, and Neighbor Co-occurrence embedding. TAWRMAC enhances embedding
stability through a memory-augmented GNN with fixedtime encoding and improves
contextual representation by explicitly capturing neighbor correlations.
Additionally, its Temporal Anonymous Walks with Restart mechanism distinguishes
between nodes exhibiting repetitive interactions and those forming new
connections beyond their immediate neighborhood. This approach captures
structural dynamics better and supports strong inductive learning. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that TAWRMAC
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in dynamic link prediction
and node classification under both transductive and inductive settings across
three different negative sampling strategies. By providing stable,
generalizable, and context-aware embeddings, TAWRMAC advances the state of the
art in continuous-time dynamic graph learning. The code is available at

### [555] [How Reinforcement Learning After Next-Token Prediction Facilitates Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11495)
*Nikolaos Tsilivis,Eran Malach,Karen Ullrich,Julia Kempe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates how reinforcement learning can enhance reasoning capabilities in large language models, beyond next-token prediction, particularly for tasks involving 'chain-of-thought' sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover why reinforcement learning combined with next-token prediction enables enhanced generalization and reasoning by large language models, particularly in domains requiring extended computation or chains of thought.

Method: The authors study the optimization process theoretically and empirically. They analyze models trained on a combination of short and long chain-of-thought sequences and prove that reinforcement learning improves performance on complex tasks like predicting the parity of bits. Experimental evaluations were conducted on language models like Llama-series.

Result: The theoretical analysis shows reinforcement learning facilitates generalization even when long sequences are rare, and empirical tests reaffirm this in both parity prediction and mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning serves as a critical tool for enabling large language models to generalize efficiently in reasoning tasks, leveraging test-time computation for enhanced performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning domains with neural networks have primarily been
enabled by a training recipe that optimizes Large Language Models, previously
trained to predict the next-token in a sequence, with reinforcement learning
algorithms. We introduce a framework to study the success of this paradigm, and
we theoretically expose the optimization mechanisms by which reinforcement
learning improves over next-token prediction in this setting. We study learning
from mixture distributions of short and long ``chain-of-thought'' sequences
encoding a single task. In particular, when the task consists of predicting the
parity of $d$ bits and long sequences are rare, we show how reinforcement
learning after next-token prediction enables autoregressive transformers to
generalize, whereas mere next-token prediction requires extreme statistical or
computational resources to do so. We further explain how reinforcement learning
leverages increased test-time computation, manifested in longer responses, to
facilitate this learning process. In a simplified setting, we theoretically
prove that autoregressive linear models following this training recipe can
efficiently learn to predict the parity of $d$ bits as long as the proportion
of long demonstrations in the data mix is not exponentially small in the input
dimension $d$. Finally, we demonstrate these same phenomena in other settings,
including the post-training of Llama-series models on mixture variations of
common mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

### [556] [Diffusion-DFL: Decision-focused Diffusion Models for Stochastic Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11590)
*Zihao Zhao,Christopher Yeh,Lingkai Kong,Kai Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel diffusion-based decision-focused learning (DFL) framework to handle uncertainty in real-world decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to improve decision-focused learning methods, which currently struggle with capturing real-world stochasticity as they rely on deterministic predictions.

Method: The authors utilize diffusion models to represent distributions of uncertain parameters and train these models using reparameterization tricks and lightweight score function estimators.

Result: The proposed diffusion DFL method shows consistent superiority over strong baselines in terms of decision quality in empirical evaluations.

Conclusion: The approach effectively integrates stochastic modeling with decision-oriented tasks, bringing robust computational advancements for decision-focused problems in uncertain environments.

Abstract: Decision-focused learning (DFL) integrates predictive modeling and
optimization by training predictors to optimize the downstream decision target
rather than merely minimizing prediction error. To date, existing DFL methods
typically rely on deterministic point predictions, which are often insufficient
to capture the intrinsic stochasticity of real-world environments. To address
this challenge, we propose the first diffusion-based DFL approach, which trains
a diffusion model to represent the distribution of uncertain parameters and
optimizes the decision by solving a stochastic optimization with samples drawn
from the diffusion model. Our contributions are twofold. First, we formulate
diffusion DFL using the reparameterization trick, enabling end-to-end training
through diffusion. While effective, it is memory and compute-intensive due to
the need to differentiate through the diffusion sampling process. Second, we
propose a lightweight score function estimator that uses only several forward
diffusion passes and avoids backpropagation through the sampling. This follows
from our results that backpropagating through stochastic optimization can be
approximated by a weighted score function formulation. We empirically show that
our diffusion DFL approach consistently outperforms strong baselines in
decision quality. The source code for all experiments is available at the
project repository: https://github.com/GT-KOALA/Diffusion_DFL.

*Panos Tsimpos,Youssef Marzouk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies generative modeling through dynamic measure transport and explores conditions for straight-line flows in stochastic processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and characterize efficient flows induced by stochastic processes for generative modeling tasks, aiming for simplicity in integration methods.

Method: The authors use a PDE characterization of flow straightness, analyze affine-in-time interpolants, and derive conditions based on stochastic flow geometry.

Result: Straight-line flows occur exclusively under deterministic endpoint couplings, and general constraints are derived for designing integrable flow transports.

Conclusion: The findings offer critical insights for designing generative models with efficient and geometrically constrained transport flows.

Abstract: We study dynamic measure transport for generative modeling: specifically,
flows induced by stochastic processes that bridge a specified source and target
distribution. The conditional expectation of the process' velocity defines an
ODE whose flow map achieves the desired transport. We ask \emph{which processes
produce straight-line flows} -- i.e., flows whose pointwise acceleration
vanishes and thus are exactly integrable with a first-order method? We provide
a concise PDE characterization of straightness as a balance between conditional
acceleration and the divergence of a weighted covariance (Reynolds) tensor.
Using this lens, we fully characterize affine-in-time interpolants and show
that straightness occurs exactly under deterministic endpoint couplings. We
also derive necessary conditions that constrain flow geometry for general
processes, offering broad guidance for designing transports that are easier to
integrate.

*Hung Phan,Son Le Vu,Ali Jannesari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces T2J, a framework to improve LLM-based translation from PyTorch to JAX by leveraging curated fixes and augmented prompts. T2J significantly boosts translation metrics and runtime performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Translating from PyTorch to JAX is challenging due to differences in design, execution, and ecosystem maturity, alongside limited parallel corpora. The paper aims to address these challenges and improve cross-framework code translation.

Method: T2J uses a pipeline involving prompt augmentation, curated datasets from PyTorch sources, and structured fixes to iterate through bug repairs and steer lightweight LLMs for better translations. Novel metrics specifically evaluate the translation quality and effort.

Result: T2J achieves up to 10% improvement on CodeBLEU, 50% on T2J FixCost Score, 1.33 points on T2J CodeTrans Score, and 100% on T2J Comparison Score. Translated code also runs significantly faster, up to 2.5x compared to baseline.

Conclusion: T2J successfully enhances PyTorch to JAX translations by strengthening LLM performance, reducing bug-fixing effort, and improving runtime efficiency. This demonstrates the value of prompt-augmentation with curated fixes.

Abstract: Despite recent progress of large language models (LLMs) on code translation
among mainstream languages, translating PyTorch to JAX remains nontrivial. The
two libraries, though both embedded in Python, differ in core design, execution
semantics, and ecosystem maturity; JAX is newer and comparatively
underrepresented in public code, and parallel PyTorch--JAX corpora are limited.
Weaknesses in existing evaluation further complicate cross-framework
benchmarking. We present T2J, a prompt-augmentation framework that strengthens
LLM-based PyTorch to JAX translation. Our pipeline (i) assembles two PyTorch
sources -- the problem-solving set from TorchLeet (Aroori & Chien, 2025) and a
GitHub-derived set from CodeParrot (Wolf et al., 2022) -- and uses GPT-4o-mini
to produce initial JAX drafts; (ii) engages two professional developers to
iteratively repair those drafts until functional equivalence, yielding a
curated fixed-bug dataset of common errors and patches; and (iii) constructs
augmented prompts that inject structured guidance from these fixes to steer
lightweight LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o-mini). We also introduce three metrics tailored
to PyTorch to JAX: T2J CodeTrans Score, T2J FixCost Score (an LLM-based
estimate of bug-fix effort), and T2J Comparison Score (LLM-as-judge).
Empirically, T2J raises GPT-4o-mini performance by up to 10% on CodeBLEU, 50%
on T2J FixCost Score, 1.33 points on T2J CodeTrans Score (0--4 scale), and 100%
on T2J Comparison Score; moreover, the generated code runs up to 2.5x faster
than the baseline.

*Taira Tsuchiya*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study refines regret analysis of optimistic Hedge in zero-sum games, improving regret bounds and demonstrating their optimality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate and improve the regret bounds of optimistic Hedge in strongly-uncoupled learning dynamics, focusing on optimality concerning the number of actions for two players.

Method: Refined theoretical analysis of regret bounds using optimization with learning rates and coefficients, complemented by lower bound derivations for individual and dynamic regrets.

Result: Improved regret bounds with $O(\sqrt{\log m \log n})$, along with matching upper and lower bounds for social regret, ensuring optimality.

Conclusion: Optimistic Hedge exhibits optimal regret bounds in zero-sum games for both social and individual settings, validating its efficiency and robustness.

Abstract: In two-player zero-sum games, the learning dynamic based on optimistic Hedge
achieves one of the best-known regret upper bounds among strongly-uncoupled
learning dynamics. With an appropriately chosen learning rate, the social and
individual regrets can be bounded by $O(\log(mn))$ in terms of the numbers of
actions $m$ and $n$ of the two players. This study investigates the optimality
of the dependence on $m$ and $n$ in the regret of optimistic Hedge. To this
end, we begin by refining existing regret analysis and show that, in the
strongly-uncoupled setting where the opponent's number of actions is known,
both the social and individual regret bounds can be improved to $O(\sqrt{\log m
\log n})$. In this analysis, we express the regret upper bound as an
optimization problem with respect to the learning rates and the coefficients of
certain negative terms, enabling refined analysis of the leading constants. We
then show that the existing social regret bound as well as these new social and
individual regret upper bounds cannot be further improved for optimistic Hedge
by providing algorithm-dependent individual regret lower bounds. Importantly,
these social regret upper and lower bounds match exactly including the constant
factor in the leading term. Finally, building on these results, we improve the
last-iterate convergence rate and the dynamic regret of a learning dynamic
based on optimistic Hedge, and complement these bounds with algorithm-dependent
dynamic regret lower bounds that match the improved bounds.

*Kelvin Kan,Xingjian Li,Benjamin J. Zhang,Tuhin Sahai,Stanley Osher,Krishna Kumar,Markos A. Katsoulakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates how the placement of layer normalization impacts training stability in deep Transformers, offering theoretical insights and practical guidelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training deep Transformers can be unstable, and layer normalization—although useful for stabilizing training—has been applied in varied ways without a unified understanding. The authors aim to systematically study how different placements of layer normalization affect stability.

Method: The authors employ theoretical analysis to derive bounds on hidden states' growth for forward stability and investigate gradient backpropagation for backward stability. They also propose scaling residual steps in Transformer blocks to improve stability and performance.

Result: The theoretical analysis uncovers key factors influencing Transformer stability under different layer normalization placements. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical predictions and demonstrate improved training stability and performance with optimized residual scaling.

Conclusion: The study provides a rigorous framework for understanding and optimizing layer normalization in Transformers, helping to guide architectural modifications for enhanced stability and performance in deep Transformer models.

Abstract: Despite their widespread use, training deep Transformers can be unstable.
Layer normalization, a standard component, improves training stability, but its
placement has often been ad-hoc. In this paper, we conduct a principled study
on the forward (hidden states) and backward (gradient) stability of
Transformers under different layer normalization placements. Our theory
provides key insights into the training dynamics: whether training drives
Transformers toward regular solutions or pathological behaviors. For forward
stability, we derive explicit bounds on the growth of hidden states in trained
Transformers. For backward stability, we analyze how layer normalization
affects the backpropagation of gradients, thereby explaining the training
dynamics of each layer normalization placement. Our analysis also guides the
scaling of residual steps in Transformer blocks, where appropriate choices can
further improve stability and performance. Our numerical results corroborate
our theoretical findings. Beyond these results, our framework provides a
principled way to sanity-check the stability of Transformers under new

*Sanghyeok Choi,Sarthak Mittal,Víctor Elvira,Jinkyoo Park,Nikolay Malkin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper combines amortised methods and particle-based methods to improve sampling from unnormalised density functions, leveraging neural samplers and Monte Carlo techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance sampling efficiency and accuracy for distributions defined by unnormalised densities, addressing challenges in exploring target distributions effectively.

Method: The authors establish connections between sequential Monte Carlo and neural sequential samplers, integrating reinforcement learning and proposing techniques like stable joint training and adaptive weight tempering.

Result: Experiments showcase improvements in matching true distributions and training stability across synthetic and real-world sampling problems, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The synergy of amortised and Monte Carlo approaches provides a promising direction for robust and accurate sampling in complex distributions.

Abstract: This paper proposes a synergy of amortised and particle-based methods for
sampling from distributions defined by unnormalised density functions. We state
a connection between sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) and neural sequential
samplers trained by maximum-entropy reinforcement learning (MaxEnt RL), wherein
learnt sampling policies and value functions define proposal kernels and twist
functions. Exploiting this connection, we introduce an off-policy RL training
procedure for the sampler that uses samples from SMC -- using the learnt
sampler as a proposal -- as a behaviour policy that better explores the target
distribution. We describe techniques for stable joint training of proposals and
twist functions and an adaptive weight tempering scheme to reduce training
signal variance. Furthermore, building upon past attempts to use experience
replay to guide the training of neural samplers, we derive a way to combine
historical samples with annealed importance sampling weights within a replay
buffer. On synthetic multi-modal targets (in both continuous and discrete
spaces) and the Boltzmann distribution of alanine dipeptide conformations, we
demonstrate improvements in approximating the true distribution as well as
training stability compared to both amortised and Monte Carlo methods.

this study, we introduce K-DREAM (Knowledge-Driven Embedding-Augmented Model),
a novel framework that leverages knowledge graphs to augment diffusion-based

application approach to just-in-time interventions for intoxication warnings.
In this work, we have created a dataset gathering TAC, accelerometer,
gyroscope, and heart rate data from the participants during a period of three

rate smartwatch data collected over an extended monitoring period to classify
intoxication levels. Previous research had used limited smartphone motion data
and conventional machine learning (ML) algorithms to classify heavy drinking
episodes; in this work, we use smartwatch data and perform a thorough
evaluation of different state-of-the-art classifiers such as the Transformer,
Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (bi-LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU),
One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks (1D-CNN), and Hyperdimensional

efficiency, demonstrating its practicality for smartwatch-based applications.

*Naman Agrawal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of Complex-Valued Convolutional Neural Networks (CVCNNs) in audio signal processing to preserve and utilize phase information, highlighting their potential and challenges through various experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the underutilization of phase information in real-valued neural networks and to establish the feasibility of CVCNNs in effectively capturing and processing this information, particularly in audio signal applications.

Method: The paper develops a framework for CVCNNs including theoretical concepts like complex convolutions, complex activations, and adaptations such as batch normalization and weight initialization, conducting empirical evaluations on image benchmarks, audio classification tasks, and using GNNs for phase modeling.

Result: The results demonstrate CVCNNs' competitive performance on images, slight superiority over real-valued CNNs on audio classification using MFCCs, and measurable gains in genre classification via phase-aware GNNs.

Conclusion: CVCNNs show promise in processing phase information, a key but often neglected feature, especially in audio applications, but require further advancements in phase-aware architectures to fully exploit their potential.

Abstract: This study explores the design and application of Complex-Valued
Convolutional Neural Networks (CVCNNs) in audio signal processing, with a focus
on preserving and utilizing phase information often neglected in real-valued
networks. We begin by presenting the foundational theoretical concepts of
CVCNNs, including complex convolutions, pooling layers, Wirtinger-based
differentiation, and various complex-valued activation functions. These are
complemented by critical adaptations of training techniques, including complex
batch normalization and weight initialization schemes, to ensure stability in
training dynamics. Empirical evaluations are conducted across three stages.
First, CVCNNs are benchmarked on standard image datasets, where they
demonstrate competitive performance with real-valued CNNs, even under synthetic
complex perturbations. Although our focus is audio signal processing, we first
evaluate CVCNNs on image datasets to establish baseline performance and
validate training stability before applying them to audio tasks. In the second
experiment, we focus on audio classification using Mel-Frequency Cepstral
Coefficients (MFCCs). CVCNNs trained on real-valued MFCCs slightly outperform
real CNNs, while preserving phase in input workflows highlights challenges in
exploiting phase without architectural modifications. Finally, a third
experiment introduces GNNs to model phase information via edge weighting, where
the inclusion of phase yields measurable gains in both binary and multi-class
genre classification. These results underscore the expressive capacity of
complex-valued architectures and confirm phase as a meaningful and exploitable
feature in audio processing applications. While current methods show promise,
especially with activations like cardioid, future advances in phase-aware
design will be essential to leverage the potential of complex representations
in neural networks.

*Ching Chang,Ming-Chih Lo,Chiao-Tung Chan,Wen-Chih Peng,Tien-Fu Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MemPromptTSS enhances multivariate time series segmentation by incorporating persistent prompts across coarse and fine-grained levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing segmentation methods fail to utilize sparse prompt signals effectively for guiding predictions across entire sequences.

Method: MemPromptTSS introduces a memory encoder that converts prompts and subsequences into persistent memory tokens for iterative multi-granularity segmentation.

Result: Experiments show MemPromptTSS improves segmentation accuracy by up to 85% and achieves stronger iterative refinement compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Persistent memory substantially boosts segmentation efficacy, making MemPromptTSS an effective tool for real-world sensing and monitoring tasks.

Abstract: Web platforms, mobile applications, and connected sensing systems generate
multivariate time series with states at multiple levels of granularity, from
coarse regimes to fine-grained events. Effective segmentation in these settings
requires integrating across granularities while supporting iterative refinement
through sparse prompt signals, which provide a compact mechanism for injecting
domain knowledge. Yet existing prompting approaches for time series
segmentation operate only within local contexts, so the effect of a prompt
quickly fades and cannot guide predictions across the entire sequence. To
overcome this limitation, we propose MemPromptTSS, a framework for iterative
multi-granularity segmentation that introduces persistent prompt memory. A
memory encoder transforms prompts and their surrounding subsequences into
memory tokens stored in a bank. This persistent memory enables each new
prediction to condition not only on local cues but also on all prompts
accumulated across iterations, ensuring their influence persists across the
entire sequence. Experiments on six datasets covering wearable sensing and
industrial monitoring show that MemPromptTSS achieves 23% and 85% accuracy
improvements over the best baseline in single- and multi-granularity
segmentation under single iteration inference, and provides stronger refinement
in iterative inference with average per-iteration gains of 2.66 percentage
points compared to 1.19 for PromptTSS. These results highlight the importance
of persistent memory for prompt-guided segmentation, establishing MemPromptTSS
as a practical and effective framework for real-world applications.

### [566] [Conformal Sparsification for Bandwidth-Efficient Edge-Cloud Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09942)
*Payel Bhattacharjee,Fengwei Tian,Meiyu Zhong,Guangyi Zhang,Osvaldo Simeone,Ravi Tandon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Sparse Quantize-and-Sample Speculative Decoding (SQS-SD), a framework that efficiently compresses edge-cloud token distributions for faster large language model inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the bottleneck caused by limited edge-cloud bandwidth during speculative decoding, which hampers efficient inference of large language models.

Method: They propose the Sparse Quantize-and-Sample SD (SQS-SD), leveraging structured sparsification and lattice-based quantization. This includes K-SQS with fixed top-K truncation and C-SQS with adaptive online conformal prediction.

Result: Empirical results show improvements in end-to-end latency and token rejection rates, demonstrating the methods' effectiveness in different operational regimes.

Conclusion: The SQS-SD framework effectively reduces bandwidth constraints and enhances speculative decoding through adaptive and structured sparsification techniques.

Abstract: Edge-cloud speculative decoding (SD) accelerates inference by having a
cloud-based large language model (LLM) that verifies draft tokens generated by
a resource-constrained small language model (SLM) at the edge. A central
bottleneck is the limited bandwidth of the edge-cloud link, which necessitates
efficient compression of draft token distributions. We first derive an
information-theoretic bound that decomposes the token rejection rate into
contributions from SLM-LLM distribution mismatch and from quantization
distortion. Guided by this analysis, we propose the Sparse Quantize-and-Sample
SD (SQS-SD) framework, which exploits distributional sparsity through
structured sparsification and lattice-based quantization. Within this
framework, K-SQS applies fixed top-K truncation, while C-SQS adaptively adjusts
the retained token set via online conformal prediction to ensure bounded
deviation from the dense distribution. Empirical results confirm that both
approaches improve end-to-end latency and rejection rates in complimentary
operating regimes.

*Mingyang Lyu,Yinqian Sun,Erliang Lin,Huangrui Li,Ruolin Chen,Feifei Zhao,Yi Zeng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Flow Policy Optimization (FPO) algorithm to enhance Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models using online reinforcement learning while addressing computational challenges in prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models are limited by the quality of supervised data, and existing methods for RL fine-tuning are computationally infeasible.

Method: Proposes the FPO algorithm, which reformulates importance sampling in flow-matching models and introduces several techniques, like structure-aware credit assignment and multi-step latent exploration, for stable and scalable reinforcement learning.

Result: FPO demonstrates consistent performance improvements in LIBERO and ALOHA tasks over strong alternative methods with stable learning under sparse rewards.

Conclusion: The FPO algorithm effectively enhances VLA models using reinforcement learning while addressing key computational and optimization challenges, validated by improved performance and ablation studies.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models such as OpenVLA, Octo, and $\pi_0$ have
shown strong generalization by leveraging large-scale demonstrations, yet their
performance is still fundamentally constrained by the quality and coverage of
supervised data. Reinforcement learning (RL) provides a promising path for
improving and fine-tuning VLAs through online interaction. However,
conventional policy gradient methods are computationally infeasible in the
context of flow-matching based models due to the intractability of the
importance sampling process, which requires explicit computation of policy
ratios. To overcome this limitation, we propose Flow Policy Optimization (FPO)
algorithm, which reformulates importance sampling by leveraging per-sample
changes in the conditional flow-matching objective. Furthermore, FPO achieves
stable and scalable online reinforcement fine-tuning of the $\pi_0$ model by
integrating structure-aware credit assignment to enhance gradient efficiency,
clipped surrogate objectives to stabilize optimization, multi-step latent
exploration to encourage diverse policy updates, and a Q-ensemble mechanism to
provide robust value estimation. We evaluate FPO on the LIBERO benchmark and
the ALOHA simulation task against supervised, preference-aligned,
diffusion-based, autoregressive online RL, and $\pi_0$-FAST baselines,
observing consistent improvements over the imitation prior and strong
alternatives with stable learning under sparse rewards. In addition, ablation
studies and analyses of the latent space dynamics further highlight the
contributions of individual components within FPO, validating the effectiveness
of the proposed computational modules and the stable convergence of the
conditional flow-matching objective during online RL.

*Frida Cantu,Salomon Ibarra,Arturo Gonzales,Jesus Barreda,Chenang Liu,Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents an unsupervised algorithm for detecting subtle anomalies in sensor data during manufacturing, overcoming limitations of labeled data reliance and extreme outlier detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing anomaly detection methods either depend on labeled data or fail to detect subtle semantic anomalies, which can lead to process inefficiencies or unnoticed defects in manufacturing.

Method: The authors propose a matrix profile-based algorithm for unsupervised anomaly detection that enables semantic segmentation and captures fabrication cycle similarities.

Result: Experimental validation on real-world sensor data confirms the method's effectiveness in identifying the onset of defect anomalies.

Conclusion: The study contributes by introducing a novel tool for precise online anomaly detection, potentially improving additive manufacturing processes.

Abstract: Online sensing plays an important role in advancing modern manufacturing. The
real-time sensor signals, which can be stored as high-resolution time series
data, contain rich information about the operation status. One of its popular
usages is online process monitoring, which can be achieved by effective anomaly
detection from the sensor signals. However, most existing approaches either
heavily rely on labeled data for training supervised models, or are designed to
detect only extreme outliers, thus are ineffective at identifying subtle
semantic off-track anomalies to capture where new regimes or unexpected
routines start. To address this challenge, we propose an matrix profile-based
unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm that captures fabrication cycle
similarity and performs semantic segmentation to precisely identify the onset
of defect anomalies in additive manufacturing. The effectiveness of the
proposed method is demonstrated by the experiments on real-world sensor data.

*Kartikeya Aneja,Nagender Aneja,Murat Kantarcioglu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GeminiNet is a framework that uses function call graphs and process call graphs to jointly study software behavior using graph neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored joint analysis of software systems leveraging function call graphs and process interaction graphs for deeper insights.

Method: The study introduces GeminiNet, a unified neural network framework with dual graph convolutional branches, adaptive gating mechanisms, and constructs a dataset of Windows executables to learn joint embeddings.

Result: Joint embeddings modeled using both function call and process interaction graphs outperformed single-graph models in analyzing software behaviors.

Conclusion: GeminiNet effectively integrates multiple perspectives of software systems, proving superior performance in unified graph analysis compared to traditional approaches.

Abstract: Software systems can be represented as graphs, capturing dependencies among
functions and processes. An interesting aspect of software systems is that they
can be represented as different types of graphs, depending on the extraction
goals and priorities. For example, function calls within the software can be
captured to create function call graphs, which highlight the relationships
between functions and their dependencies. Alternatively, the processes spawned
by the software can be modeled to generate process interaction graphs, which
focus on runtime behavior and inter-process communication. While these graph
representations are related, each captures a distinct perspective of the
system, providing complementary insights into its structure and operation.
While previous studies have leveraged graph neural networks (GNNs) to analyze
software behaviors, most of this work has focused on a single type of graph
representation. The joint modeling of both function call graphs and process
interaction graphs remains largely underexplored, leaving opportunities for
deeper, multi-perspective analysis of software systems. This paper presents a
pipeline for constructing and training Function Call Graphs (FCGs) and Process
Call Graphs (PCGs) and learning joint embeddings. We demonstrate that joint
embeddings outperform a single-graph model. In this paper, we propose
GeminiNet, a unified neural network approach that learns joint embeddings from
both FCGs and PCGs. We construct a new dataset of 635 Windows executables (318
malicious and 317 benign), extracting FCGs via Ghidra and PCGs via Any.Run
sandbox. GeminiNet employs dual graph convolutional branches with an adaptive
gating mechanism that balances contributions from static and dynamic views.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to solve the issue of low generalization in EEG recognition systems due to dataset-specific constraints and individual user differences.

Method: The BITE architecture combines aligned time-frequency streams, pyramid time-frequency attention (PTFA), and bidirectional temporal convolution networks (BiTCN) to achieve robust feature extraction and modeling.

Result: The proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on four EEG paradigms, significantly improving both within-subject accuracy and cross-subject generalization.

Conclusion: The study validates that paradigm-aligned spectral-temporal processing is key for reliable BCI systems, with BITE standing out for its computational efficiency and robust performance across diverse EEG tasks.

Abstract: Existing EEG recognition models suffer from poor cross-paradigm
generalization due to dataset-specific constraints and individual variability.
To overcome these limitations, we propose BITE (Bidirectional Time-Freq Pyramid
Network), an end-to-end unified architecture featuring robust multistream
synergy, pyramid time-frequency attention (PTFA), and bidirectional adaptive
convolutions. The framework uniquely integrates: 1) Aligned time-frequency
streams maintaining temporal synchronization with STFT for bidirectional
modeling, 2) PTFA-based multi-scale feature enhancement amplifying critical
neural patterns, 3) BiTCN with learnable fusion capturing forward/backward
neural dynamics. Demonstrating enhanced robustness, BITE achieves
state-of-the-art performance across four divergent paradigms (BCICIV-2A/2B,
HGD, SD-SSVEP), excelling in both within-subject accuracy and cross-subject
generalization. As a unified architecture, it combines robust performance
across both MI and SSVEP tasks with exceptional computational efficiency. Our
work validates that paradigm-aligned spectral-temporal processing is essential
for reliable BCI systems. Just as its name suggests, BITE "takes a bite out of
EEG." The source code is available at https://github.com/cindy-hong/BiteEEG.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces STAT, a new fine-tuning method for language models, outperforming traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) by targeting specific skill gaps identified with a teacher model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the saturation problem where language models show little to no improvement through traditional supervised fine-tuning on familiar data sets.

Method: The method leverages a stronger language model as a teacher to identify missing skills in the student model's responses, and then creates a modified training set via two approaches: reweighting existing examples based on missing skills (STAT-Sel) or synthesizing new examples (STAT-Syn).

Result: The STAT method improved performance by up to 7.5% on in-distribution benchmarks like MATH and by an average of 4.6% on out-of-distribution benchmarks, showing complementarities with reinforcement learning methods.

Conclusion: Skill-targeted adaptive training, as proposed in STAT, offers significant improvements in model performance and should be integrated into existing training pipelines.

Abstract: Language models often show little to no improvement (i.e., "saturation") when
trained via vanilla supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on data similar to what they
saw in their training set (e.g., MATH). We introduce a new fine-tuning
strategy, STAT, to train such a student model by using the metacognition
ability of a stronger large language model (LLM) as the teacher. The teacher
uses the task dataset to create a list of skills needed for the task, and then
labels each data point with its required skills (Didolkar et al., 2024). By
monitoring the student's answers, the teacher creates a Missing-Skill-Profile
for the student, tracking how often they failed to apply each skill in their
responses. We use this idea to build a modified training set in one of two
ways. In STAT-Sel, the teacher uses an existing set of training examples but
adaptively reweights them according to the Missing-Skill-Profile. In STAT-Syn,
the teacher synthesizes additional examples involving missing skills. Across
extensive experiments on Llama and Qwen models, our methods yield improvements
of up to 7.5% on MATH, whereas SFT provides only limited gains. Furthermore,
STAT enhances performance on out-of-distribution benchmarks (e.g., AIME24/25,
AMC23, etc.) by an average of 4.6%. Crucially, we find that STAT is
complementary to RL via GRPO (Shao et al., 2024): after the model is improved
using STAT to address skill gaps, GRPO continues to add further gains. We
conclude that skill-targeted adaptive training should broadly improve current
training pipelines. Our code is available at:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address unstable optimization and poor generalization in small and imbalanced biomedical datasets.

Method: Implemented FOSSIL, a regret-minimizing weighting framework based on sample difficulty, using a softmax-based uncertainty metric to design a four-stage curriculum and apply it to Mpox skin lesion diagnosis using deep learning (both convolutional and transformer-based architectures).

Result: FOSSIL significantly improved discrimination (AUC = 0.9573), calibration (ECE = 0.053), and robustness compared to baselines without requiring additional data manipulation.

Conclusion: FOSSIL serves as a generalizable, efficient, and interpretable approach to handling difficulty-aware learning in medical imaging with limited data.

Abstract: Deep learning in small and imbalanced biomedical datasets remains
fundamentally constrained by unstable optimization and poor generalization. We
present the first biomedical implementation of FOSSIL (Flexible Optimization
via Sample-Sensitive Importance Learning), a regret-minimizing weighting
framework that adaptively balances training emphasis according to sample
difficulty. Using softmax-based uncertainty as a continuous measure of
difficulty, we construct a four-stage curriculum (Easy-Very Hard) and integrate
FOSSIL into both convolutional and transformer-based architectures for Mpox
skin lesion diagnosis. Across all settings, FOSSIL substantially improves
discrimination (AUC = 0.9573), calibration (ECE = 0.053), and robustness under
real-world perturbations, outperforming conventional baselines without
metadata, manual curation, or synthetic augmentation. The results position
FOSSIL as a generalizable, data-efficient, and interpretable framework for
difficulty-aware learning in medical imaging under data scarcity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel deep reinforcement learning framework, One4Many-StablePacker (O4M-SP), is introduced to improve 3D bin packing with stability constraints and diverse bin dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for the 3D bin packing problem lack generalization for various bin dimensions and don't account for practical stability constraints.

Method: O4M-SP utilizes a weighted reward function incorporating loading rate and height variance metrics, combined with policy optimization techniques to mitigate entropy collapse, ensuring more effective packing.

Result: Experiments show O4M-SP performs well on diverse bin dimensions and surpasses baseline methods in packing performance under stability constraints.

Conclusion: O4M-SP provides a scalable solution for 3D bin packing problems, excelling in practical applications with stability considerations.

Abstract: The three-dimensional bin packing problem (3D-BPP) is widely applied in
logistics and warehousing. Existing learning-based approaches often neglect
practical stability-related constraints and exhibit limitations in generalizing
across diverse bin dimensions. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
deep reinforcement learning framework, One4Many-StablePacker (O4M-SP). The
primary advantage of O4M-SP is its ability to handle various bin dimensions in
a single training process while incorporating support and weight constraints
common in practice. Our training method introduces two innovative mechanisms.
First, it employs a weighted reward function that integrates loading rate and a
new height difference metric for packing layouts, promoting improved bin
utilization through flatter packing configurations. Second, it combines clipped
policy gradient optimization with a tailored policy drifting method to mitigate
policy entropy collapse, encouraging exploration at critical decision nodes
during packing to avoid suboptimal solutions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that O4M-SP generalizes successfully across diverse bin dimensions and
significantly outperforms baseline methods. Furthermore, O4M-SP exhibits strong
practical applicability by effectively addressing packing scenarios with
stability constraints.

*Hehe Fan,Yi Yang,Mohan Kankanhalli,Fei Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discusses Translution, which combines self-attention's adaptive element selection with the relative encoding advantages of convolution while introducing a lightweight variant, α-Translution, for computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in modeling, such as self-attention's dependence on absolute positional embedding and convolution's fixed kernel size limiting adaptability.

Method: The authors proposed Translution to unify self-attention adaptive identification and convolution's relative encoding while introducing α-Translution as a computationally efficient version.

Result: Experiments reveal Translution, including α-Translution, performs better in accuracy compared to self-attention in vision and NLP tasks.

Conclusion: Translution combines advantages of self-attention and convolution, making it effective for data modeling tasks without compromising computational efficiency.

Abstract: When modeling a given type of data, we consider it to involve two key
aspects: 1) identifying relevant elements (e.g., image pixels or textual words)
to a central element, as in a convolutional receptive field, or to a query
element, as in self-attention, and 2) encoding these tokens effectively.
Self-attention can adaptively identify these elements but relies on absolute
positional embedding for structural representation learning. In contrast,
convolution encodes elements in a relative manner, yet their fixed kernel size
limits their ability to adaptively select the relevant elements. In this paper,
we introduce Translution, an operation that unifies the adaptive identification
capability of self-attention and the relative encoding advantage of
convolution. However, this integration leads to a substantial increase in the
number of parameters, exceeding most currently available computational
resources. Therefore, we propose a lightweight variant of Translution, named
{\alpha}-Translution. Experiments on computer vision and natural language
processing tasks show that Translution (including {\alpha}-Translution)
achieves superior accuracy compared to self-attention. The code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ADEPT improves continual pretraining of large language models for domain adaptation by selectively expanding layers and applying dynamic tuning based on domain relevance, achieving better performance with fewer tuned parameters and reduced training time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenges of catastrophic forgetting and limited domain capacity during continual pretraining for domain adaptation in large language models. Previous methods lack efficiency in disentangling general from domain-specific learning.

Method: ADEPT employs two primary stages: selective layer expansion to minimize interference with general-domain knowledge and adaptive unit-wise decoupled tuning that assigns learning rates based on general domain importance of parameters.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that ADEPT achieves up to 5.76% improvement in general-domain performance and 5.58% in target-domain performance, tuning only 15% of parameters and cutting training time by more than half.

Conclusion: ADEPT provides a novel and effective approach for efficient, robust, and scalable domain-adaptive continual pretraining, validated through extensive experiments, theoretical analyses, and ablation studies.

Abstract: Conventional continual pretraining (CPT) for large language model (LLM)
domain adaptation often suffers from catastrophic forgetting and limited domain
capacity. Existing strategies adopt layer expansion, introducing additional
trainable parameters to accommodate new knowledge. However, the uniform
expansion and updates still entangle general and domain learning, undermining
its effectiveness. Our pilot studies reveal that LLMs exhibit functional
specialization, where layers and units differentially encode general-critical
capabilities, suggesting that parameter expansion and optimization should be
function-aware. We then propose ADEPT, Adaptive Expansion and Dynamic Decoupled
Tuning for continual pretraining, a two-stage framework for domain-adaptive
CPT. ADEPT first performs General-Competence Guided Selective Layer Expansion,
duplicating layers least critical for the general domain to increase
representational capacity while minimizing interference with general knowledge.
It then applies Adaptive Unit-Wise Decoupled Tuning, disentangling parameter
units within expanded layers according to their general-domain importance and
assigning asymmetric learning rates to balance knowledge injection and
retention. Experiments on mathematical and medical benchmarks show that ADEPT
outperforms full-parameter CPT by up to 5.76% on the general domain and 5.58%
on the target domain with only 15% of parameters tuned and less than 50%
training time. Ablation studies, theoretical analysis, and extended
investigations further demonstrate the necessity of targeted expansion and
decoupled optimization, providing new principles for efficient and robust
domain-adaptive CPT. Our code is open-sourced at

### [576] [Gradient-based Model Shortcut Detection for Time Series Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10075)
*Salomon Ibarra,Frida Cantu,Kaixiong Zhou,Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper examines the shortcut learning behavior in deep neural networks for time series classification (TSC) and proposes a detection method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art performance in TSC but may rely on spurious correlations in training data, impeding generalization.

Method: The study investigates point-based shortcut learning in TSC models and proposes a simple detection method that identifies shortcut behaviors using other classes without reliance on test data or clean training classes.

Result: The proposed shortcut detection method is evaluated on UCR time series datasets, highlighting its feasibility.

Conclusion: The paper sheds light on shortcut learning in TSC and introduces a viable approach to identify shortcuts, advancing the understanding of model generalization in time series tasks.

Abstract: Deep learning models have attracted lots of research attention in time series
classification (TSC) task in the past two decades. Recently, deep neural
networks (DNN) have surpassed classical distance-based methods and achieved
state-of-the-art performance. Despite their promising performance, deep neural
networks (DNNs) have been shown to rely on spurious correlations present in the
training data, which can hinder generalization. For instance, a model might
incorrectly associate the presence of grass with the label ``cat" if the
training set have majority of cats lying in grassy backgrounds. However, the
shortcut behavior of DNNs in time series remain under-explored. Most existing
shortcut work are relying on external attributes such as gender, patients
group, instead of focus on the internal bias behavior in time series models.
  In this paper, we take the first step to investigate and establish
point-based shortcut learning behavior in deep learning time series
classification. We further propose a simple detection method based on other
class to detect shortcut occurs without relying on test data or clean training
classes. We test our proposed method in UCR time series datasets.

### [577] [Rademacher Meets Colors: More Expressivity, but at What Cost ?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10101)
*Martin Carrasco,Caio Deberaldini Netto,Vahan A. Martirosyan,Aneeqa Mehrab,Ehimare Okoyomon,Caterina Graziani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper establishes a theoretical link between graph neural network (GNN) expressivity and generalization by analyzing them through the lens of coloring algorithms and Rademacher complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The trade-off between the expressivity of GNNs and their generalization capabilities has been observed empirically, but no theoretical explanation exists. The authors aim to bridge this knowledge gap.

Method: The paper uses the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) hierarchy and coloring algorithms to analyze how the expressivity of GNNs impacts their Rademacher complexity, which serves as a measure of generalization. They also extend their framework beyond message-passing GNNs and 1-WL.

Result: The authors theoretically demonstrate that increased expressivity in GNNs corresponds to higher Rademacher complexity, leading to weaker guarantees for generalization. They also prove the stability of Rademacher complexity under variations in color counts across datasets.

Conclusion: This work provides a principled and unifying framework to understand the trade-off between GNN expressivity and generalization, showing that higher expressive power often compromises generalization capabilities.

Abstract: The expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs) is typically understood
through their correspondence with graph isomorphism tests such as the
Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) hierarchy. While more expressive GNNs can distinguish a
richer set of graphs, they are also observed to suffer from higher
generalization error. This work provides a theoretical explanation for this
trade-off by linking expressivity and generalization through the lens of
coloring algorithms. Specifically, we show that the number of equivalence
classes induced by WL colorings directly bounds the GNNs Rademacher complexity
-- a key data-dependent measure of generalization. Our analysis reveals that
greater expressivity leads to higher complexity and thus weaker generalization
guarantees. Furthermore, we prove that the Rademacher complexity is stable
under perturbations in the color counts across different samples, ensuring
robustness to sampling variability across datasets. Importantly, our framework
is not restricted to message-passing GNNs or 1-WL, but extends to arbitrary GNN
architectures and expressivity measures that partition graphs into equivalence
classes. These results unify the study of expressivity and generalization in
GNNs, providing a principled understanding of why increasing expressive power
often comes at the cost of generalization.

*Kanishkha Jaisankar,Sunidhi Tandel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes Align2Act, a framework using instruction-tuned LLMs for motion planning in autonomous driving. It emphasizes human-aligned reasoning and demonstrates improved performance using real-world benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of ensuring that LLMs in autonomous driving can accurately capture human driving logic and produce interpretable, human-like motion planning.

Method: The method involves deriving structured driving instructions based on human reasoning and traffic rules, incorporating the Align2ActChain module for step-by-step reasoning to produce rationales and trajectories, and fine-tuning LLaMA-2-7B on the nuPlan dataset.

Result: The method achieved an open-loop score of 85.17 and closed-loop scores of 70.31 (non-reactive) and 66.96 (reactive) on the nuPlan Test14-random benchmark, showing better planning quality and human-likeness.

Conclusion: Structured reasoning using LLMs significantly enhances the interpretability, human alignment, and performance of motion planners in autonomous driving real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Motion planning in complex scenarios is a core challenge in autonomous
driving. Conventional methods apply predefined rules or learn from driving data
to generate trajectories, while recent approaches leverage large language
models (LLMs) for decision-making. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs
truly capture human driving logic. We propose Align2Act, a motion planning
framework that transforms instruction-tuned LLMs into interpretable planners
aligned with human behavior. We derive structured driving instructions based on
human reasoning patterns (e.g., anticipate hazards, yield at intersections) and
traffic rules (e.g., stop at red lights, maintain lane boundaries). Our
Align2ActChain module guides step-by-step reasoning to produce both an
interpretable rationale and a safe trajectory. By fine-tuning LLaMA-2-7B with
LoRA on one million scenarios from the nuPlan dataset, our method achieves an
open-loop score of 85.17 and closed-loop scores of 70.31 (non-reactive) and
66.96 (reactive) on Test14-random. Unlike prior work focused on synthetic or
open-loop settings, we demonstrate improved planning quality and human-likeness
on the real-world nuPlan closed-loop benchmark. Ablation studies confirm that
structured reasoning significantly improves performance over baseline LLM
planners.

### [579] [PANTHER: Generative Pretraining Beyond Language for Sequential User Behavior Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10102)
*Guilin Li,Yun Zhang,Xiuyuan Chen,Chengqi Li,Bo Wang,Linghe Kong,Wenjia Wang,Weiran Huang,Matthias Hwai Yong Tan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes PANTHER, a framework extending generative pretraining to user behavior data for improved sequential representation learning and real-time inference in online systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap of limited behavioral knowledge modeling in large language models by leveraging generative pretraining for user behavior data.

Method: PANTHER combines generative and discriminative approaches, using novel techniques like Structured Tokenization, Sequence Pattern Recognition Module, Unified User-Profile Embedding, and real-time scalability with offline pretrained embeddings.

Result: PANTHER demonstrates significant improvements in next-transaction prediction (+25.6% HitRate@1) and fraud detection recall (+38.6%), showing strong generalization across benchmarks, outperforming transformer baselines by up to 21%.

Conclusion: PANTHER proves to be a scalable and high-performance solution for sequential user behavior modeling, effectively bridging the gap in behavioral knowledge representation and enabling impactful industrial applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown that generative pretraining can
distill vast world knowledge into compact token representations. While LLMs
encapsulate extensive world knowledge, they remain limited in modeling the
behavioral knowledge contained within user interaction histories. User behavior
forms a distinct modality, where each action, defined by multi-dimensional
attributes such as time, context, and transaction type, constitutes a
behavioral token. Modeling these high-cardinality sequences is challenging, and
discriminative models often falter under limited supervision. To bridge this
gap, we extend generative pretraining to user behavior, learning transferable
representations from unlabeled behavioral data analogous to how LLMs learn from
text. We present PANTHER, a hybrid generative-discriminative framework that
unifies user behavior pretraining and downstream adaptation, enabling
large-scale sequential user representation learning and real-time inference.
PANTHER introduces: (1) Structured Tokenization to compress multi-dimensional
transaction attributes into an interpretable vocabulary; (2) Sequence Pattern
Recognition Module (SPRM) for modeling periodic transaction motifs; (3) a
Unified User-Profile Embedding that fuses static demographics with dynamic
transaction histories; and (4) Real-time scalability enabled by offline caching
of pretrained embeddings for millisecond-level inference. Fully deployed and
operational online at WeChat Pay, PANTHER delivers a 25.6 percent boost in
next-transaction prediction HitRate@1 and a 38.6 percent relative improvement
in fraud detection recall over baselines. Cross-domain evaluations on public
benchmarks show strong generalization, achieving up to 21 percent HitRate@1
gains over transformer baselines, establishing PANTHER as a scalable,
high-performance framework for industrial sequential user behavior modeling.

### [580] [Lighter-X: An Efficient and Plug-and-play Strategy for Graph-based Recommendation through Decoupled Propagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10105)
*Yanping Zheng,Zhewei Wei,Frank de Hoog,Xu Chen,Hongteng Xu,Yuhang Ye,Jiadeng Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Lighter-X is a modular framework for GNN-based recommenders that reduces parameter and computational complexity while maintaining high performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scalability challenges of GNN-based recommenders, such as LightGCN, arise due to high parameter complexity ($\mathcal{O}(n \times d)$) for embeddings, making deployment on large graphs impractical.

Method: Lighter-X employs efficient compression for adjacency and embedding matrices to achieve reduced parameter complexity ($\mathcal{O}(h \times d)$, where $h \ll n$) and optimizes training through a decoupled framework.

Result: Experiments show Lighter-X achieves comparable or improved results on graphs with millions of edges, using only 1\% of the parameters required by LightGCN.

Conclusion: Lighter-X is a scalable solution for large-scale GNN-based recommendation systems, enabling practical deployment and significant efficiency improvements.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in
recommendation systems. However, conventional graph-based recommenders, such as
LightGCN, require maintaining embeddings of size $d$ for each node, resulting
in a parameter complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n \times d)$, where $n$ represents
the total number of users and items. This scaling pattern poses significant
challenges for deployment on large-scale graphs encountered in real-world
applications. To address this scalability limitation, we propose
\textbf{Lighter-X}, an efficient and modular framework that can be seamlessly
integrated with existing GNN-based recommender architectures. Our approach
substantially reduces both parameter size and computational complexity while
preserving the theoretical guarantees and empirical performance of the base
models, thereby enabling practical deployment at scale. Specifically, we
analyze the original structure and inherent redundancy in their parameters,
identifying opportunities for optimization. Based on this insight, we propose
an efficient compression scheme for the sparse adjacency structure and
high-dimensional embedding matrices, achieving a parameter complexity of
$\mathcal{O}(h \times d)$, where $h \ll n$. Furthermore, the model is optimized
through a decoupled framework, reducing computational complexity during the
training process and enhancing scalability. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that Lighter-X achieves comparable performance to baseline models with
significantly fewer parameters. In particular, on large-scale interaction
graphs with millions of edges, we are able to attain even better results with
only 1\% of the parameter over LightGCN.

### [581] [Preference-driven Knowledge Distillation for Few-shot Node Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10116)
*Xing Wei,Chunchun Chen,Rui Fan,Xiaofeng Cao,Sourav Medya,Wei Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel PKD framework combining the strengths of large language models (LLMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs) to perform few-shot node classification efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with effectively handling diverse local node topologies in text-attributed graphs (TAGs) and rely on human-annotated labels, while scalable zero-/few-shot learning from LLMs remains challenging.

Method: The PKD framework involves a GNN-preference-driven node selector for prediction distillation from LLMs to teacher GNNs and a node-preference-driven GNN selector for optimal knowledge distillation to student GNNs.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate improved performance in few-shot node classification tasks on real-world TAGs using the PKD framework.

Conclusion: The PKD framework successfully combines LLM scalability and GNN adaptability to address key challenges in TAGs, enabling effective few-shot node classification.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) can efficiently process text-attributed graphs
(TAGs) due to their message-passing mechanisms, but their training heavily
relies on the human-annotated labels. Moreover, the complex and diverse local
topologies of nodes of real-world TAGs make it challenging for a single
mechanism to handle. Large language models (LLMs) perform well in
zero-/few-shot learning on TAGs but suffer from a scalability challenge.
Therefore, we propose a preference-driven knowledge distillation (PKD)
framework to synergize the complementary strengths of LLMs and various GNNs for
few-shot node classification. Specifically, we develop a GNN-preference-driven
node selector that effectively promotes prediction distillation from LLMs to
teacher GNNs. To further tackle nodes' intricate local topologies, we develop a
node-preference-driven GNN selector that identifies the most suitable teacher
GNN for each node, thereby facilitating tailored knowledge distillation from
teacher GNNs to the student GNN. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of
our proposed framework in few-shot node classification on real-world TAGs.

### [582] [CacheClip: Accelerating RAG with Effective KV Cache Reuse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10129)
*Bin Yang,Qiuyu Leng,Jun Zeng,Zhenhua Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CacheClip is a novel framework for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems that reduces time-to-first-token bottlenecks while maintaining high generation quality, outperforming previous methods in efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KV cache reuse methods in RAG systems face a trade-off between efficiency and maintaining attention between input chunks, which impacts the generation quality.

Method: CacheClip uses an auxiliary model to guide token selection, shared prefixes to reduce redundant attention, and a grouping strategy for local coherence during partial cache updates.

Result: CacheClip retains 94.8% and 85.0% performance on NIAH and LongBench datasets, outperforming previous methods by 25.2% and 35.1%, and accelerates inference by up to 1.92x in prefill time.

Conclusion: CacheClip effectively resolves the efficiency-quality trade-off in RAG systems by improving generation quality and reducing bottlenecks in processing.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems suffer from severe
time-to-first-token (TTFT) bottlenecks due to long input sequences. Existing KV
cache reuse methods face a fundamental trade-off: prefix caching requires
identical prefixes that rarely occur in RAG scenarios, while direct
precomputation sacrifices quality due to missing inter-chunk attention and
repeated attention sinks. Recent methods like APE and CacheBlend partially
address these issues but remain inadequate for robust RAG applications. This
paper presents CacheClip, a novel framework that achieves both fast TTFT and
high generation quality. Our key insight is that small auxiliary LLMs exhibit
similar last-layer attention distributions to primary LLMs (the target model
for generation), enabling efficient identification of tokens critical for
restoring inter-chunk attention, thereby significantly improving response
quality on cross-chunk reasoning tasks. CacheClip integrates three techniques:
(1) auxiliary-model-guided token selection for selective KV cache
recomputation, where the auxiliary model is finetuned to improve selection
accuracy, (2) shared prefixes to eliminate redundant attention sinks, and (3)
grouping strategy to maintain local coherence during partial KV cache updates.
Experiments show CacheClip retains up to 94.8% and 85.0% of full-attention
performance on NIAH and LongBench, outperforming APE and CacheBlend by 25.2%
and 35.1% on NIAH (with reomp% = 20%). Meanwhile, CacheClip accelerates LLM
inference by up to 1.92x in prefill time, providing a practical solution to the
efficiency-quality trade-off in RAG systems.

*Lancheng Zou,Shuo Yin,Zehua Pei,Tsung-Yi Ho,Farzan Farnia,Bei Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PermLLM, a framework with learnable channel permutation to optimize N:M sparse models, achieving notable improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional channel permutation methods rely on handcrafted metrics, which are often inadequate to fully capture how pruning affects model performance.

Method: PermLLM uses a learnable channel permutation mechanism with Sinkhorn normalization to optimize reordering for sparsity, reducing pruning-induced errors. It also employs a block-wise channel permutation strategy to enhance efficiency.

Result: PermLLM outperforms existing methods on models like LLaMA, Qwen, and OPT, showcasing its ability to optimize N:M sparse models.

Conclusion: PermLLM offers a novel, efficient post-training pruning framework, improving the accuracy of sparse models by leveraging learnable and adaptive channel permutation.

Abstract: Channel permutation is a powerful technique for enhancing the accuracy of N:M
sparse models by reordering the channels of weight matrices to prioritize the
retention of important weights. However, traditional channel permutation
methods rely on handcrafted quality metrics, which often fail to accurately
capture the true impact of pruning on model performance. To address this
limitation, we propose PermLLM, a novel post-training pruning framework that
introduces learnable channel permutation (LCP) for N:M sparsity. LCP leverages
Sinkhorn normalization to transform discrete permutation matrices into
differentiable soft permutation matrices, enabling end-to-end optimization.
Additionally, PermLLM incorporates an efficient block-wise channel permutation
strategy, which significantly reduces the number of learnable parameters and
computational complexity. PermLLM seamlessly integrates with existing one-shot
pruning methods to adaptively optimize channel permutations, effectively
mitigating pruning-induced errors. Extensive experiments on the LLaMA series,
Qwen, and OPT models demonstrate that PermLLM achieves superior performance in
optimizing N:M sparse models. The code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FIRE, a framework for interpretable and robust time series forecasting by leveraging frequency domain decomposition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current time series forecasting methods lack interpretability and struggle with dynamic data distribution across time and frequency domains.

Method: FIRE uses a frequency domain approach, modeling amplitude and phase components separately, adaptively learning frequency weights, employing a targeted loss function, and offering a novel training paradigm for sparse data.

Result: Experiments show FIRE outperforms state-of-the-art models in long-term forecasting and boosts interpretability for time series data.

Conclusion: FIRE provides a unified framework for mathematically grounded, interpretable, and robust time series forecasting with improved forecasting accuracy.

Abstract: Current approaches for time series forecasting, whether in the time or
frequency domain, predominantly use deep learning models based on linear layers
or transformers. They often encode time series data in a black-box manner and
rely on trial-and-error optimization solely based on forecasting performance,
leading to limited interpretability and theoretical understanding. Furthermore,
the dynamics in data distribution over time and frequency domains pose a
critical challenge to accurate forecasting. We propose FIRE, a unified
frequency domain decomposition framework that provides a mathematical
abstraction for diverse types of time series, so as to achieve interpretable
and robust time series forecasting. FIRE introduces several key innovations:
(i) independent modeling of amplitude and phase components, (ii) adaptive
learning of weights of frequency basis components, (iii) a targeted loss
function, and (iv) a novel training paradigm for sparse data. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that FIRE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
models on long-term forecasting benchmarks, achieving superior predictive
performance and significantly enhancing interpretability of time series

TL;DR: The paper explores the generalization of model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) in autonomous racing and introduces a novel context-aware algorithm, cMask, which shows improved generalization to adversary behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to ensure autonomous vehicles, and other safety-critical robotic systems, can generalize effectively to unseen real-world scenarios by enhancing MBRL algorithms to address their susceptibility to environmental changes.

Method: The researchers frame autonomous racing in a simulated environment as a learning problem, use contextual Markov decision processes to handle driving dynamics, and propose a novel context-aware MBRL extension called cMask.

Result: The study benchmarks MBRL algorithms and demonstrates that context-aware algorithms, including cMask, outperform context-free approaches in out-of-distribution generalization and show better performance in racing scenarios.

Conclusion: Context-aware extensions like cMask significantly improve the generalization and performance of MBRL algorithms in autonomous driving tasks, making them more suited for real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles have shown promising potential to be a groundbreaking
technology for improving the safety of road users. For these vehicles, as well
as many other safety-critical robotic technologies, to be deployed in
real-world applications, we require algorithms that can generalize well to
unseen scenarios and data. Model-based reinforcement learning algorithms (MBRL)
have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance and data efficiency across a
diverse set of domains. However, these algorithms have also shown
susceptibility to changes in the environment and its transition dynamics.
  In this work, we explore the performance and generalization capabilities of
MBRL algorithms for autonomous driving, specifically in the simulated
autonomous racing environment, Roboracer (formerly F1Tenth). We frame the
head-to-head racing task as a learning problem using contextual Markov decision
processes and parameterize the driving behavior of the adversaries using the
context of the episode, thereby also parameterizing the transition and reward
dynamics. We benchmark the behavior of MBRL algorithms in this environment and
propose a novel context-aware extension of the existing literature, cMask. We
demonstrate that context-aware MBRL algorithms generalize better to
out-of-distribution adversary behaviors relative to context-free approaches. We
also demonstrate that cMask displays strong generalization capabilities, as
well as further performance improvement relative to other context-aware MBRL
approaches when racing against adversaries with in-distribution behaviors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve generative controllability in conditional diffusion models, especially under extremely noisy conditions where existing methods fail.

Method: The method involves learning pseudo conditions as substitutes for clean ones and progressively refining them using temporal ensembling. Additionally, a Reverse-time Diffusion Condition (RDC) technique is introduced to enhance memorization and facilitate refinement.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across varying noise levels in tasks like class-conditional image generation and visuomotor policy generation.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a robust solution for handling highly noisy conditions in conditional diffusion models, surpassing existing methods.

Abstract: Conditional diffusion models have the generative controllability by
incorporating external conditions. However, their performance significantly
degrades with noisy conditions, such as corrupted labels in the image
generation or unreliable observations or states in the control policy
generation. This paper introduces a robust learning framework to address
extremely noisy conditions in conditional diffusion models. We empirically
demonstrate that existing noise-robust methods fail when the noise level is
high. To overcome this, we propose learning pseudo conditions as surrogates for
clean conditions and refining pseudo ones progressively via the technique of
temporal ensembling. Additionally, we develop a Reverse-time Diffusion
Condition (RDC) technique, which diffuses pseudo conditions to reinforce the
memorization effect and further facilitate the refinement of the pseudo
conditions. Experimentally, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
across a range of noise levels on both class-conditional image generation and
visuomotor policy generation tasks.The code can be accessible via the project

TL;DR: This paper addresses entropy collapse in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) by analyzing token-level entropy changes and proposing STEER, a token-level reweighting scheme to stabilize policy diversity and improve performance in reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Entropy collapse in RLVR training reduces policy diversity and generalization, thereby compromising the potential of enhancing LLM reasoning. Current methods trying to prevent entropy collapse are limited in effectiveness.

Method: The authors analyze token-level entropy changes in RLVR and introduce STEER, an entropy-change-aware reweighting scheme designed to stabilize entropy dynamics through adaptive adjustments at the token level.

Result: STEER effectively mitigates entropy collapse, stabilizes entropy dynamics, and improves downstream performance in various mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: STEER provides a direct and adaptive solution to entropy collapse, addressing the limitations of current methods and enhancing performance in RLVR-driven reasoning tasks.

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) can enhance LLM
reasoning, its training process poses a critical risk: entropy collapse. This
phenomenon is a rapid loss of policy diversity, stemming from the
exploration-exploitation imbalance and leading to a lack of generalization.
Recent entropy-intervention methods aim to prevent \coloredtext{entropy
collapse}, yet their underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this paper, we
conduct a quantitative analysis to reveal token-level entropy changes and how
existing entropy intervention methods help avoid entropy collapse. Our findings
point out a fundamental limitation of existing methods: they attempt to control
entropy dynamics indirectly. By only affecting related factors, such as the
advantage signal and generation probability, their effectiveness is inherently
limited and could potentially fail. To address this limitation, we introduce an
entropy-change-aware reweighting scheme, namely Stabilizing Token-level
Entropy-changE via Reweighting (STEER), that adaptively stabilizes entropy
dynamics through fine-grained token-level adjustments. Our approach mitigates
over-exploitation while fostering robust exploration. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that STEER significantly mitigates entropy collapse, stabilizes
entropy dynamics, and achieves stronger downstream performance across various
mathematical reasoning benchmarks \footnote{Our code is available at

Conclusion: INR-Bench provides a robust platform to assess and compare INR architectures, aiding future INR research advancements.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have gained success in various signal

Result: CauchyNet achieved up to 50% lower mean absolute error in predictions with fewer parameters across domains like transportation and energy.

Conclusion: CauchyNet demonstrates strong theoretical performance, computational efficiency, and potential in predictive modeling, especially in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: A novel neural network inspired by Cauchy's integral formula, is proposed for
function approximation tasks that include time series forecasting, missing data
imputation, etc. Hence, the novel neural network is named CauchyNet. By
embedding real-valued data into the complex plane, CauchyNet efficiently
captures complex temporal dependencies, surpassing traditional real-valued
models in both predictive performance and computational efficiency. Grounded in
Cauchy's integral formula and supported by the universal approximation theorem,
CauchyNet offers strong theoretical guarantees for function approximation. The
architecture incorporates complex-valued activation functions, enabling robust
learning from incomplete data while maintaining a compact parameter footprint
and reducing computational overhead. Through extensive experiments in diverse
domains, including transportation, energy consumption, and epidemiological
data, CauchyNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in predictive
accuracy, often achieving a 50% lower mean absolute error with fewer
parameters. These findings highlight CauchyNet's potential as an effective and
efficient tool for data-driven predictive modeling, particularly in
resource-constrained and data-scarce environments.

### [590] [RLFR: Extending Reinforcement Learning for LLMs with Flow Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10201)
*Jinghao Zhang,Naishan Zheng,Ruilin Li,Dongzhou Cheng,Zheming Liang,Feng Zhao,Jiaqi Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces RLFR as a new reinforcement learning framework using flow rewards derived from latent space to enhance reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in exploring reasoning trajectories in existing RLVR models and reduce reliance on expensive annotation costs for Process Reward Models (PRMs).

Method: The authors propose a flow-based reward system where model latent's velocity deviations within flow fields, constructed using off-policy and on-policy data, are quantified as reward signals.

Result: The proposed RLFR demonstrated effective reasoning performance on language and multimodal benchmarks, utilizing expressive latent spaces for reward signals.

Conclusion: RLFR offers a novel, cost-efficient method for reward shaping by leveraging latent space flow rewards and shows its potential in improving LLM reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
a promising framework for improving reasoning abilities in Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, policy optimized with binary verification prone to
overlook potential valuable exploration in reasoning trajectory. In view of
heavy annotation cost of golden Process Reward Models (PRMs), recent works
attempt using auxiliary signals for reward shaping of process tokens, involving
entropy and likelihood collected from logit space. In this work, we offer a
novel perspective on shaping RLVR with flow rewards derived from latent space,
and propose RLFR, where the flow fields of model latents are constructed from
either off-policy high-quality data and on-policy rejection sampling data, and
the velocity deviations of policy latents within it are quantified to serve as
a reward signal. RLFR first demonstrates that a well-established flow field can
be a sound environment for reward signal collection, highlighting the
expressive latent space is much underexplored. Moreover, RLFR is able to
compress any off-policy expert data as reference for constituting reward
signals, and we show that the efficient context dependence compressed within
the hidden states are utilized, rather than individual token-level denotation
for context comprehending. Experiments on both language and multimodal
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the reliability of flow rewards, and
suggesting a promising paradigm for reward shaping with auxiliary signals.

### [591] [Hierarchical Bayesian Flow Networks for Molecular Graph Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10211)
*Yida Xiong,Jiameng Chen,Kun Li,Hongzhi Zhang,Xiantao Cai,Wenbin Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents GraphBFN, a framework addressing the limitations of existing molecular graph generation models by unifying training with sampling, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address discrepancies in existing molecular graph generation models that treat the training process as regression (continuous prediction) instead of classification, leading to inefficiencies, overfitting, and reduced diversity.

Method: GraphBFN is a hierarchical framework using Bayesian Flow Networks. It leverages the cumulative distribution function to unify the training objective with the sampling rounding operation, aligning continuous predictions with discrete classifications.

Result: GraphBFN achieves faster generation and outperforms previous methods, setting new benchmarks on QM9 and ZINC250k for molecular graph generation.

Conclusion: By overcoming training-inference discrepancies, GraphBFN enhances molecular graph diversity and generalization, establishing a robust alternative to existing methods.

Abstract: Molecular graph generation is essentially a classification generation
problem, aimed at predicting categories of atoms and bonds. Currently,
prevailing paradigms such as continuous diffusion models are trained to predict
continuous numerical values, treating the training process as a regression
task. However, the final generation necessitates a rounding step to convert
these predictions back into discrete classification categories, which is
intrinsically a classification operation. Given that the rounding operation is
not incorporated during training, there exists a significant discrepancy
between the model's training objective and its inference procedure. As a
consequence, an excessive emphasis on point-wise precision can lead to
overfitting and inefficient learning. This occurs because considerable efforts
are devoted to capturing intra-bin variations that are ultimately irrelevant to
the discrete nature of the task at hand. Such a flaw results in diminished
molecular diversity and constrains the model's generalization capabilities. To
address this fundamental limitation, we propose GraphBFN, a novel hierarchical
coarse-to-fine framework based on Bayesian Flow Networks that operates on the
parameters of distributions. By innovatively introducing Cumulative
Distribution Function, GraphBFN is capable of calculating the probability of
selecting the correct category, thereby unifying the training objective with
the sampling rounding operation. We demonstrate that our method achieves
superior performance and faster generation, setting new state-of-the-art
results on the QM9 and ZINC250k molecular graph generation benchmarks.

### [592] [SGM: A Statistical Godel Machine for Risk-Controlled Recursive Self-Modification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10232)
*Xuening Wu,Shenqin Yin,Yanlan Kang,Xinhang Zhang,Qianya Xu,Zeping Chen,Wenqiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Statistical Gödel Machine (SGM), a framework for safely implementing recursive self-modification with statistical confidence tests rather than formal proofs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recursive self-modification has become crucial in AutoML, neural architecture search, and adaptive optimization, yet existing systems lack mechanisms for ensuring safe code changes.

Method: The SGM framework employs e-values and Hoeffding bounds to statistically validate code modifications at a chosen confidence level, with a global error budget to bound cumulative risks. CTHS is also proposed to optimize error budget allocation via confirmation events.

Result: Experiments show SGM successfully certifies improvements on CIFAR-100, rejects invalid updates on ImageNet-100, and remains robust across reinforcement learning and optimization benchmarks.

Conclusion: SGM sets a foundation for risk-aware continual self-modification in AI systems, providing statistical safety layers for adaptive learning processes.

Abstract: Recursive self-modification is increasingly central in AutoML, neural
architecture search, and adaptive optimization, yet no existing framework
ensures that such changes are made safely. Godel machines offer a principled
safeguard by requiring formal proofs of improvement before rewriting code;
however, such proofs are unattainable in stochastic, high-dimensional settings.
We introduce the Statistical Godel Machine (SGM), the first statistical safety
layer for recursive edits. SGM replaces proof-based requirements with
statistical confidence tests (e-values, Hoeffding bounds), admitting a
modification only when superiority is certified at a chosen confidence level,
while allocating a global error budget to bound cumulative risk across
rounds.We also propose Confirm-Triggered Harmonic Spending (CTHS), which
indexes spending by confirmation events rather than rounds, concentrating the
error budget on promising edits while preserving familywise
validity.Experiments across supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and
black-box optimization validate this role: SGM certifies genuine gains on
CIFAR-100, rejects spurious improvement on ImageNet-100, and demonstrates
robustness on RL and optimization benchmarks.Together, these results position
SGM as foundational infrastructure for continual, risk-aware self-modification
in learning systems.Code is available at:

*Ziyu Zhou,Keyan Hu,Ling Zhang,Zhaohui Xue,Yutian Fang,Yusha Zheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study introduces PSCNet for downscaling low-resolution soil moisture (SM) data to high spatial and temporal resolution using validated ERA5-Land variables. The method shows superior accuracy and spatial detail compared to other approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inversion of soil moisture data at a temporal scale is challenging due to incomplete auxiliary factors, necessitating advanced methodologies to enhance spatio-temporal resolution.

Method: The study designed a Progressive Scale Convolutional Network (PSCNet) with two key components: a Multi-Frequency Temporal Fusion (MFTF) module for temporal dynamics and a bespoke Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) block for spatial details, leveraging ERA5-Land variables for downscaling low-resolution SMAP SM data.

Result: PSCNet outperformed other methods in various validation experiments, showing high accuracy (mean R value of 0.881), effective error reduction, and strong temporal and spatial results.

Conclusion: PSCNet proves to be a robust method for spatio-temporal downscaling of SM, demonstrating high performance, enhanced spatial accuracy, and temporal sensitivity, making it valuable for hydrological and meteorological applications.

Abstract: Soil moisture (SM) plays a critical role in hydrological and meteorological
processes. High-resolution SM can be obtained by combining coarse passive
microwave data with fine-scale auxiliary variables. However, the inversion of
SM at the temporal scale is hindered by the incompleteness of surface auxiliary
factors. To address this issue, first, we introduce validated high temporal
resolution ERA5-Land variables into the downscaling process of the
low-resolution SMAP SM product. Subsequently, we design a progressive scale
convolutional network (PSCNet), at the core of which are two innovative
components: a multi-frequency temporal fusion module (MFTF) for capturing
temporal dynamics, and a bespoke squeeze-and-excitation (SE) block designed to
preserve fine-grained spatial details. Using this approach, we obtained
seamless SM products for the Tibetan Plateau (TP) from 2016 to 2018 at 10-km
spatial and 3-hour temporal resolution. The experimental results on the TP
demonstrated the following: 1) In the satellite product validation, the PSCNet
exhibited comparable accuracy and lower error, with a mean R value of 0.881,
outperforming other methods. 2) In the in-situ site validation, PSCNet
consistently ranked among the top three models for the R metric across all
sites, while also showing superior performance in overall error reduction. 3)
In the temporal generalization validation, the feasibility of using
high-temporal resolution ERA5-Land variables for downscaling was confirmed, as
all methods maintained an average relative error within 6\% for the R metric
and 2\% for the ubRMSE metric. 4) In the temporal dynamics and visualization
validation, PSCNet demonstrated excellent temporal sensitivity and vivid
spatial details. Overall, PSCNet provides a promising solution for
spatio-temporal downscaling by effectively modeling the intricate
spatio-temporal relationships in SM data.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MPPReasoner, a multimodal large language model designed for molecular property prediction. It integrates molecular images and SMILES strings with advanced training strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing models in molecular property prediction, including poor cross-task generalization, lack of interpretability, and limited chemical reasoning.

Method: MPPReasoner is built on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct and uses a two-stage training strategy: supervised fine-tuning with 16,000 high-quality reasoning trajectories and reinforcement learning with principle-guided rewards emphasizing chemical reasoning and logical consistency.

Result: The proposed model achieves significant improvements over baselines, with 7.91% and 4.53% performance boosts on in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks respectively. It also demonstrates strong cross-task generalization and produces interpretable reasoning paths.

Conclusion: MPPReasoner advances molecular property prediction by combining interpretability, cross-task generalization, and chemically sound reasoning, making it highly beneficial for practical applications in chemistry.

Abstract: Molecular property prediction is crucial for drug discovery and materials
science, yet existing approaches suffer from limited interpretability, poor
cross-task generalization, and lack of chemical reasoning capabilities.
Traditional machine learning models struggle with task transferability, while
specialized molecular language models provide little insight into their
decision-making processes. To address these limitations, we propose
\textbf{MPPReasoner}, a multimodal large language model that incorporates
chemical reasoning for molecular property prediction. Our approach, built upon
Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, integrates molecular images with SMILES strings to
enable comprehensive molecular understanding. We develop a two-stage training
strategy: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using 16,000 high-quality reasoning
trajectories generated through expert knowledge and multiple teacher models,
followed by Reinforcement Learning from Principle-Guided Rewards (RLPGR). RLPGR
employs verifiable, rule-based rewards that systematically evaluate chemical
principle application, molecular structure analysis, and logical consistency
through computational verification. Extensive experiments across 8 datasets
demonstrate significant performance improvements, with MPPReasoner
outperforming the best baselines by 7.91\% and 4.53\% on in-distribution and
out-of-distribution tasks respectively. MPPReasoner exhibits exceptional
cross-task generalization and generates chemically sound reasoning paths that
provide valuable insights into molecular property analysis, substantially
enhancing both interpretability and practical utility for chemists. Code is

### [595] [Enhancing the Cross-Size Generalization for Solving Vehicle Routing Problems via Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10262)
*Jingwen Li,Zhiguang Cao,Yaoxin Wu,Tang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the lack of generalizability in deep models for vehicle routing problems (VRPs) by proposing a continual learning framework to train models on instances of ascending problem sizes, achieving superior performance across sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models for VRPs are often trained on a single problem size, limiting their ability to generalize to other sizes and reducing practical applicability.

Method: The continual learning framework involves inter-task regularization to retain knowledge from smaller sizes, intra-task regularization to consolidate behaviors for each size, and experience replay to revisit previously seen instances.

Result: The proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art deep models, including those designed to enhance generalizability, across both seen and unseen problem sizes. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the framework's components.

Conclusion: The continual learning framework demonstrates its feasibility and effectiveness in addressing the challenge of size generalization in VRPs, setting a path toward more practical applications of deep models.

Abstract: Exploring machine learning techniques for addressing vehicle routing problems
has attracted considerable research attention. To achieve decent and efficient
solutions, existing deep models for vehicle routing problems are typically
trained and evaluated using instances of a single size. This substantially
limits their ability to generalize across different problem sizes and thus
hampers their practical applicability. To address the issue, we propose a
continual learning based framework that sequentially trains a deep model with
instances of ascending problem sizes. Specifically, on the one hand, we design
an inter-task regularization scheme to retain the knowledge acquired from
smaller problem sizes in the model training on a larger size. On the other
hand, we introduce an intra-task regularization scheme to consolidate the model
by imitating the latest desirable behaviors during training on each size.
Additionally, we exploit the experience replay to revisit instances of formerly
trained sizes for mitigating the catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results
show that our approach achieves predominantly superior performance across
various problem sizes (either seen or unseen in the training), as compared to
state-of-the-art deep models including the ones specialized for
generalizability enhancement. Meanwhile, the ablation studies on the key
designs manifest their synergistic effect in the proposed framework.

*Christopher Chiu,Silviu Pitis,Mihaela van der Schaar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces VivaBench, a benchmark assessing clinical reasoning in large language models, highlighting deficiencies in iterative diagnostic reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in current LLMs that focus on single-turn clinical knowledge recall, they aim to measure sequential diagnostic reasoning in uncertain clinical scenarios.

Method: They developed 1762 physician-curated clinical vignettes requiring multi-step reasoning and tested LLMs' ability to probe, investigate, and diagnose iteratively.

Result: Current LLMs struggle with cognitive errors like fixation and premature closure when performing iterative clinical reasoning under uncertainty.

Conclusion: VivaBench reveals fundamental shortcomings in how LLMs approach complex, sequential decision-making, providing a tool for advancing conversational medical AI.

Abstract: Clinical reasoning in medicine is a hypothesis-driven process where
physicians refine diagnoses from limited information through targeted history,
physical examination, and diagnostic investigations. In contrast, current
medical benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) primarily assess knowledge
recall through single-turn questions, where complete clinical information is
provided upfront. To address this gap, we introduce VivaBench, a multi-turn
benchmark that evaluates sequential clinical reasoning in LLM agents. Our
dataset consists of 1762 physician-curated clinical vignettes structured as
interactive scenarios that simulate a (oral) examination in medical training,
requiring agents to actively probe for relevant findings, select appropriate
investigations, and synthesize information across multiple steps to reach a
diagnosis. While current LLMs demonstrate competence in diagnosing conditions
from well-described clinical presentations, their performance degrades
significantly when required to navigate iterative diagnostic reasoning under
uncertainty in our evaluation. Our analysis identified several failure modes
that mirror common cognitive errors in clinical practice, including: (1)
fixation on initial hypotheses, (2) inappropriate investigation ordering, (3)
premature diagnostic closure, and (4) failing to screen for critical
conditions. These patterns reveal fundamental limitations in how current LLMs
reason and make decisions under uncertainty. Through VivaBench, we provide a
standardized benchmark for evaluating conversational medical AI systems for
real-world clinical decision support. Beyond medical applications, we
contribute to the larger corpus of research on agentic AI by demonstrating how
sequential reasoning trajectories can diverge in complex decision-making
environments.

*Michael Y. Hu,Benjamin Van Durme,Jacob Andreas,Harsh Jhamtani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents ECHO, a framework to enhance language model agents' sample efficiency by using hindsight experience replay to optimize failed attempts into positive examples. ECHO significantly improves performance in novel environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the poor sample efficiency of language model agents in novel and costly interaction environments by leveraging their capability to generate and reason about counterfactual trajectories.

Method: ECHO adapts hindsight experience replay with two key components: a hindsight rule for subgoal identification and optimized trajectory generation, and an update rule for maintaining compressed trajectory memory.

Result: ECHO showed up to 80% improvement over vanilla baselines in tasks involving stateful environments like XMiniGrid and PeopleJoinQA. It also outperformed advanced agent architectures in XMiniGrid.

Conclusion: ECHO effectively uses past experiences to enhance adaptability and sample efficiency in language model agents, proving its potential in both simple and complex environments.

Abstract: Language model (LM) agents deployed in novel environments often exhibit poor
sample efficiency when learning from sequential interactions. This
significantly hinders the usefulness of such agents in environments where
interaction is costly (for example, when they interact with humans or reset
physical systems). While a number of existing LM agent architectures
incorporate various mechanisms for experience storage and reflection, they make
limited use of LMs' abilities to directly generate or reason about full
counterfactual trajectories. We introduce ECHO (Experience Consolidation via
Hindsight Optimization), a prompting framework that adapts hindsight experience
replay from reinforcement learning for language model agents. ECHO generates
optimized trajectories for alternative goals that could have been achieved
during failed attempts, effectively creating synthetic positive examples from
unsuccessful interactions. Our approach consists of two components: a hindsight
rule that uses the language model itself to identify relevant subgoals and
generate optimized trajectories, and an update rule that maintains compressed
trajectory representations in memory. We evaluate ECHO on stateful versions of
XMiniGrid, a text-based navigation and planning benchmark, and PeopleJoinQA, a
collaborative information-gathering enterprise simulation. Across both domains,
ECHO outperforms vanilla language agent baselines by up to 80%; in XMiniGrid,
it also outperforms a number of sophisticated agent architectures including
Reflexion and AWM, demonstrating faster adaptation to novel environments
through more effective utilization of past experiences.

### [598] [Multi-View Graph Learning with Graph-Tuple](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10341)
*Shiyu Chen,Ningyuan,Huang,Soledad Villar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-view graph-tuple framework to improve Graph Neural Networks (GNN) performance on dense graphs, such as point clouds and molecular interactions. This approach captures interactions at multiple scales and surpasses single-graph baselines in molecular and cosmological applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the inefficiency of GNNs on dense graphs due to their scaling with the number of graph edges. Single-scale sparsification methods discard important multi-scale information, motivating the need for a framework that accommodates interactions across multiple scales.

Method: The authors propose a multi-view graph-tuple framework that partitions a dense graph into disjoint subgraphs, capturing both local and long-range interactions. A heterogeneous message-passing architecture inspired by non-commuting operators is used to learn multi-view representations. Theoretical proofs demonstrate the framework's expressiveness and superior oracle risk guarantees.

Result: The proposed multi-view graph-tuple models outperform traditional single-graph message-passing GNNs in two domains: predicting molecular properties from Coulomb matrices and inferring cosmological parameters from point clouds.

Conclusion: The multi-view graph-tuple framework enhances the efficiency and accuracy of GNNs on dense graphs, providing a scalable and versatile solution for scientific applications. It proves to be more expressive and performs better than single-graph baselines in multiple tested scenarios.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) typically scale with the number of graph edges,
making them well suited for sparse graphs but less efficient on dense graphs,
such as point clouds or molecular interactions. A common remedy is to sparsify
the graph via similarity thresholding or distance pruning, but this forces an
arbitrary choice of a single interaction scale and discards crucial information
from other scales. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a multi-view
graph-tuple framework. Instead of a single graph, our graph-tuple framework
partitions the graph into disjoint subgraphs, capturing primary local
interactions and weaker, long-range connections. We then learn multi-view
representations from the graph-tuple via a heterogeneous message-passing
architecture inspired by the theory of non-commuting operators, which we
formally prove is strictly more expressive and guarantees a lower oracle risk
compared to single-graph message-passing models. We instantiate our framework
on two scientific domains: molecular property prediction from feature-scarce
Coulomb matrices and cosmological parameter inference from geometric point
clouds. On both applications, our multi-view graph-tuple models demonstrate
better performance than single-graph baselines, highlighting the power and
versatility of our multi-view approach.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a noninvasive biomarker based on sleep data to detect antidepressant intake remotely using wearable sensors and a transformer-based model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nonadherence to antidepressants leads to serious health and economic consequences, and existing detection methods are either invasive or inaccurate, creating a need for an effective monitoring tool.

Method: The study uses a transformer-based model to analyze sleep data obtained from wearable or contactless sensors to monitor antidepressant adherence in a noninvasive manner.

Result: The biomarker achieved an AUROC of 0.84, generalized across various drug classes, scaled with dosage, and showed robustness against other psychotropics. It tracked real-world adherence changes over longitudinal data.

Conclusion: This approach provides an objective and scalable solution for remote antidepressant adherence monitoring, with potential to enhance depression management and outcomes.

Abstract: Antidepressant nonadherence is pervasive, driving relapse, hospitalization,
suicide risk, and billions in avoidable costs. Clinicians need tools that
detect adherence lapses promptly, yet current methods are either invasive
(serum assays, neuroimaging) or proxy-based and inaccurate (pill counts,
pharmacy refills). We present the first noninvasive biomarker that detects
antidepressant intake from a single night of sleep. A transformer-based model
analyzes sleep data from a consumer wearable or contactless wireless sensor to
infer antidepressant intake, enabling remote, effortless, daily adherence
assessment at home. Across six datasets comprising 62,000 nights from >20,000
participants (1,800 antidepressant users), the biomarker achieved AUROC = 0.84,
generalized across drug classes, scaled with dose, and remained robust to
concomitant psychotropics. Longitudinal monitoring captured real-world
initiation, tapering, and lapses. This approach offers objective, scalable
adherence surveillance with potential to improve depression care and outcomes.

*Kenichi Satoh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces NMF-LAB, an approach reimagining classification via non-negative matrix tri-factorization, directly mapping covariates to labels without separate classifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard NMF methods are unsupervised and don't effectively use label information for classification tasks, necessitating external classifiers.

Method: The proposed NMF-LAB factors the label matrix directly using non-negative matrix tri-factorization, incorporating covariates as explanatory variables and enabling direct probabilistic mapping to labels.

Result: NMF-LAB shows competitive accuracy, scalability, interpretability, and robustness in classification tasks across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: NMF-LAB unifies regression and classification in a probabilistic tri-NMF framework, offering a scalable and interpretable solution for modern classification challenges.

Abstract: Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is widely used for dimensionality
reduction and interpretable analysis, but standard formulations are
unsupervised and cannot directly exploit class labels. Existing supervised or
semi-supervised extensions usually incorporate labels only via penalties or
graph constraints, still requiring an external classifier. We propose
\textit{NMF-LAB} (Non-negative Matrix Factorization for Label Matrix), which
redefines classification as the inverse problem of non-negative matrix
tri-factorization (tri-NMF). Unlike joint NMF methods, which reconstruct both
features and labels, NMF-LAB directly factorizes the label matrix $Y$ as the
observation, while covariates $A$ are treated as given explanatory variables.
This yields a direct probabilistic mapping from covariates to labels,
distinguishing our method from label-matrix factorization approaches that
mainly model label correlations or impute missing labels. Our inversion offers
two key advantages: (i) class-membership probabilities are obtained directly
from the factorization without a separate classifier, and (ii) covariates,
including kernel-based similarities, can be seamlessly integrated to generalize
predictions to unseen samples. In addition, unlabeled data can be encoded as
uniform distributions, supporting semi-supervised learning. Experiments on
diverse datasets, from small-scale benchmarks to the large-scale MNIST dataset,
demonstrate that NMF-LAB achieves competitive predictive accuracy, robustness
to noisy or incomplete labels, and scalability to high-dimensional problems,
while preserving interpretability. By unifying regression and classification
within the tri-NMF framework, NMF-LAB provides a novel, probabilistic, and
scalable approach to modern classification tasks.

*Jiachi Zhao,Zehong Wang,Yamei Liao,Chuxu Zhang,Yanfang Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TreeDiff introduces a Monte Carlo Tree Search-guided diffusion framework for efficient, controllable graph generation, resolving limitations in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address issues in graph generation using diffusion models, namely unstable quality and lack of control over desired graph properties.

Method: TreeDiff employs three key features: macro-step expansion to reduce tree depth, dual-space denoising for scalability and fidelity, and a dual-space verifier for early prediction of long-term rewards.

Result: Experiments on molecular generation benchmarks show TreeDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance with better inference-time scalability compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: TreeDiff is a scalable, practical solution for controllable graph generation, handling both unconditional and conditional settings effectively.

Abstract: Graph generation is a fundamental problem in graph learning with broad
applications across Web-scale systems, knowledge graphs, and scientific domains
such as drug and material discovery. Recent approaches leverage diffusion
models for step-by-step generation, yet unconditional diffusion offers little
control over desired properties, often leading to unstable quality and
difficulty in incorporating new objectives. Inference-time guidance methods
mitigate these issues by adjusting the sampling process without retraining, but
they remain inherently local, heuristic, and limited in controllability. To
overcome these limitations, we propose TreeDiff, a Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS) guided dual-space diffusion framework for controllable graph generation.
TreeDiff is a plug-and-play inference-time method that expands the search space
while keeping computation tractable. Specifically, TreeDiff introduces three
key designs to make it practical and scalable: (1) a macro-step expansion
strategy that groups multiple denoising updates into a single transition,
reducing tree depth and enabling long-horizon exploration; (2) a dual-space
denoising mechanism that couples efficient latent-space denoising with
lightweight discrete correction in graph space, ensuring both scalability and
structural fidelity; and (3) a dual-space verifier that predicts long-term
rewards from partially denoised graphs, enabling early value estimation and
removing the need for full rollouts. Extensive experiments on 2D and 3D
molecular generation benchmarks, under both unconditional and conditional
settings, demonstrate that TreeDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance.
Notably, TreeDiff exhibits favorable inference-time scaling: it continues to
improve with additional computation, while existing inference-time methods
plateau early under limited resources.

*Sara Dragutinović,Andrew M. Saxe,Aaditya K. Singh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores how transformers employ in-context learning (ICL) using gradient descent-like strategies, extending the understanding to classification tasks with non-linear (softmax) activation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the in-context learning algorithms transformers employ, specifically in realistic tasks such as classification with softmax activation.

Method: The study extends prior theoretical work on linear self-attention to non-linear settings, investigating gradient descent learning in softmax transformers both theoretically and empirically.

Result: Transformers learn gradient descent in-context in the kernel feature space, using context-adaptive learning rates in the softmax setting. Empirical tests support the theoretical adaptability of softmax attention.

Conclusion: This research enhances the theoretical understanding of in-context learning in more realistic scenarios, offers new intuitions, and lays the groundwork for further exploration in larger models.

Abstract: The remarkable ability of transformers to learn new concepts solely by
reading examples within the input prompt, termed in-context learning (ICL), is
a crucial aspect of intelligent behavior. Here, we focus on understanding the
learning algorithm transformers use to learn from context. Existing theoretical
work, often based on simplifying assumptions, has primarily focused on linear
self-attention and continuous regression tasks, finding transformers can learn
in-context by gradient descent. Given that transformers are typically trained
on discrete and complex tasks, we bridge the gap from this existing work to the
setting of classification, with non-linear (importantly, softmax) activation.
We find that transformers still learn to do gradient descent in-context, though
on functionals in the kernel feature space and with a context-adaptive learning
rate in the case of softmax transformer. These theoretical findings suggest a
greater adaptability to context for softmax attention, which we empirically
verify and study through ablations. Overall, we hope this enhances theoretical
understanding of in-context learning algorithms in more realistic settings,
pushes forward our intuitions and enables further theory bridging to larger
models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces HiLoMoE, a hierarchical framework combining vertical and horizontal scaling for CTR prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient yet expressive models in CTR prediction to enhance Return-On-Investment (ROI).

Method: HiLoMoE combines lightweight rank-1 experts and hierarchical routing to enable parallel execution and scalable MoE layers.

Result: HiLoMoE improves performance metrics with an average AUC increase of 0.20% and a reduction in computational FLOPs by 18.5%.

Conclusion: HiLoMoE offers a parameter-efficient and scalable solution for CTR prediction with better performance-efficiency tradeoffs.

Abstract: Deep models have driven significant advances in click-through rate (CTR)
prediction. While vertical scaling via layer stacking improves model
expressiveness, the layer-by-layer sequential computation poses challenges to
efficient scaling. Conversely, horizontal scaling through Mixture of Experts
(MoE) achieves efficient scaling by activating a small subset of experts in
parallel, but flat MoE layers may struggle to capture the hierarchical
structure inherent in recommendation tasks. To push the Return-On-Investment
(ROI) boundary, we explore the complementary strengths of both directions and
propose HiLoMoE, a hierarchical LoRA MoE framework that enables holistic
scaling in a parameter-efficient manner. Specifically, HiLoMoE employs
lightweight rank-1 experts for parameter-efficient horizontal scaling, and
stacks multiple MoE layers with hierarchical routing to enable combinatorially
diverse expert compositions. Unlike conventional stacking, HiLoMoE routes based
on prior layer scores rather than outputs, allowing all layers to execute in
parallel. A principled three-stage training framework ensures stable
optimization and expert diversity. Experiments on four public datasets show
that HiLoMoE achieving better performance-efficiency tradeoff, achieving an
average AUC improvement of 0.20\% in AUC and 18.5\% reduction in FLOPs compared
to the non-MoE baseline.

*Zixiang Xu,Menghui Zhou,Jun Qi,Xuanhan Fan,Yun Yang,Po Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel Multi-Task Learning (MTL) framework called MTL-FSL, designed to model time-varying feature correlations in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) data, achieving superior performance compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of current MTL frameworks which fail to account for the time-varying nature of feature correlations in modeling longitudinal Alzheimer's Disease data.

Method: The paper introduces the MTL-FSL framework featuring a novel Feature Similarity Laplacian (FSL) penalty. This penalty models dynamic feature relationships while ensuring temporal smoothness. The Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is used to solve the non-smooth optimization problem.

Result: The proposed MTL-FSL framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, outperforming several baseline models.

Conclusion: The MTL-FSL framework provides both enhanced predictive accuracy and improved biological interpretability, representing a significant advancement for modeling longitudinal AD data.

Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder in
aging populations, posing a significant and escalating burden on global
healthcare systems. While Multi-Tusk Learning (MTL) has emerged as a powerful
computational paradigm for modeling longitudinal AD data, existing frameworks
do not account for the time-varying nature of feature correlations. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel MTL framework, named Feature Similarity
Laplacian graph Multi-Task Learning (MTL-FSL). Our framework introduces a novel
Feature Similarity Laplacian (FSL) penalty that explicitly models the
time-varying relationships between features. By simultaneously considering
temporal smoothness among tasks and the dynamic correlations among features,
our model enhances both predictive accuracy and biological interpretability. To
solve the non-smooth optimization problem arising from our proposed penalty
terms, we adopt the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)
algorithm. Experiments conducted on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that our proposed MTL-FSL framework
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming various baseline methods.

### [605] [Reverse Supervision at Scale: Exponential Search Meets the Economics of Annotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10446)
*Masoud Makrehchi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study explores reversed-supervision in machine learning, showing that fast computation cannot fully replace the need for initial human input and seed supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of reducing dependency on labeled data through reversed-supervision strategies, while highlighting the limitations of computation alone in achieving effective learning.

Method: Develop and analyze a reversed-supervision strategy that minimizes error. The approach involves human input and synthetic labels, combining active, semi-supervised, and self-training loops.

Result: Demonstrated that human-designed objectives and validation are essential, even with advanced computational methods and generative AI amplifiers.

Conclusion: Human or human-grade input remains indispensable for anchoring machine learning systems to intended tasks, despite fast computational advancements.

Abstract: We analyze a reversed-supervision strategy that searches over labelings of a
large unlabeled set \(B\) to minimize error on a small labeled set \(A\). The
search space is \(2^n\), and the resulting complexity remains exponential even
under large constant-factor speedups (e.g., quantum or massively parallel
hardware). Consequently, arbitrarily fast -- but not exponentially faster --
computation does not obviate the need for informative labels or priors. In
practice, the machine learning pipeline still requires an initial human
contribution: specifying the objective, defining classes, and providing a seed
set of representative annotations that inject inductive bias and align models
with task semantics. Synthetic labels from generative AI can partially
substitute provided their quality is human-grade and anchored by a
human-specified objective, seed supervision, and validation. In this view,
generative models function as \emph{label amplifiers}, leveraging small
human-curated cores via active, semi-supervised, and self-training loops, while
humans retain oversight for calibration, drift detection, and failure auditing.
Thus, extreme computational speed reduces wall-clock time but not the
fundamental supervision needs of learning; initial human (or human-grade) input
remains necessary to ground the system in the intended task.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning-based simulator for multi-animal behaviors, achieving enhanced predictive accuracy compared to standard methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome the limitations of traditional mathematical models and bridge the gap in realistic multi-animal behavior simulation, especially due to unknown locomotion dynamics.

Method: They propose a data-driven approach integrating deep reinforcement learning and counterfactual simulation, utilizing distance-based pseudo-rewards to align simulated and real trajectories.

Result: The approach outperforms traditional imitation and reinforcement learning techniques in species-specific behavior reproduction and reward acquisition.

Conclusion: The method shows promise for flexible counterfactual predictions and multi-animal behavior simulations, with applications in studying complex biological systems.

Abstract: Simulators of animal movements play a valuable role in studying behavior.
Advances in imitation learning for robotics have expanded possibilities for
reproducing human and animal movements. A key challenge for realistic
multi-animal simulation in biology is bridging the gap between unknown
real-world transition models and their simulated counterparts. Because
locomotion dynamics are seldom known, relying solely on mathematical models is
insufficient; constructing a simulator that both reproduces real trajectories
and supports reward-driven optimization remains an open problem. We introduce a
data-driven simulator for multi-animal behavior based on deep reinforcement
learning and counterfactual simulation. We address the ill-posed nature of the
problem caused by high degrees of freedom in locomotion by estimating movement
variables of an incomplete transition model as actions within an RL framework.
We also employ a distance-based pseudo-reward to align and compare states
between cyber and physical spaces. Validated on artificial agents, flies,
newts, and silkmoth, our approach achieves higher reproducibility of
species-specific behaviors and improved reward acquisition compared with
standard imitation and RL methods. Moreover, it enables counterfactual behavior
prediction in novel experimental settings and supports multi-individual
modeling for flexible what-if trajectory generation, suggesting its potential
to simulate and elucidate complex multi-animal behaviors.

*Yi Ren,Xinjie Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in multivariate time series forecasting for IoT systems by introducing the Shared-Auxiliary Embedding (SAE) framework and its parameter-efficient LightSAE module, achieving significant improvements across datasets with minimal parameter increase.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome the limitations of existing methods for multivariate time series forecasting that utilize shared embedding layers, which fail to preserve valuable channel-specific information.

Method: The authors propose the Shared-Auxiliary Embedding (SAE) framework, which decomposes embeddings into shared and channel-specific components. They further design LightSAE, leveraging low-rank factorization and gated shared components to optimize parameter efficiency.

Result: Extensive experiments across nine IoT-related datasets and four backbone architectures show that LightSAE achieves MSE improvements of up to 22.8% while increasing parameters by only 4.0%.

Conclusion: The LightSAE module effectively mitigates embedding bottlenecks by capturing both shared and channel-specific patterns, proving its efficacy and efficiency for IoT time series forecasting applications.

Abstract: Modern Internet of Things (IoT) systems generate massive, heterogeneous
multivariate time series data. Accurate Multivariate Time Series Forecasting
(MTSF) of such data is critical for numerous applications. However, existing
methods almost universally employ a shared embedding layer that processes all
channels identically, creating a representational bottleneck that obscures
valuable channel-specific information. To address this challenge, we introduce
a Shared-Auxiliary Embedding (SAE) framework that decomposes the embedding into
a shared base component capturing common patterns and channel-specific
auxiliary components modeling unique deviations. Within this decomposition, we
\rev{empirically observe} that the auxiliary components tend to exhibit
low-rank and clustering characteristics, a structural pattern that is
significantly less apparent when using purely independent embeddings.
Consequently, we design LightSAE, a parameter-efficient embedding module that
operationalizes these observed characteristics through low-rank factorization
and a shared, gated component pool. Extensive experiments across 9 IoT-related
datasets and 4 backbone architectures demonstrate LightSAE's effectiveness,
achieving MSE improvements of up to 22.8\% with only 4.0\% parameter increase.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces AnyBCQ, a hardware-friendly extension of Binary-Coded Quantization that supports multi-precision LLM inference with significant accuracy and efficiency gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The deployment of large language models faces memory and latency constraints, creating a need for quantization techniques that can flexibly balance accuracy and efficiency.

Method: The authors introduce AnyBCQ, which uses binary-coded quantization to represent weights as binary bit-planes with scale factors. This enables bit-plane-level computations and dynamic per-request precision selection via a specialized kernel.

Result: Experiments demonstrate significant accuracy retention, especially in low-bit regimes, and an up to 3.0x throughput gain over half precision and 1.2x over existing multi-precision methods.

Conclusion: AnyBCQ aligns algorithmic adaptability with hardware efficiency, making it a practical solution for deploying multi-precision LLMs across various operational demands.

Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) is increasingly constrained by
memory and latency bottlenecks, motivating the need for quantization techniques
that flexibly balance accuracy and efficiency. Recent work has introduced
multi-precision models, which enable inference at multiple precisions within a
single model depending on runtime constraints. To support such flexibility,
quantized weights are often stored as bit-planes, where hardware efficiency
improves when the compute operates directly at the bit-plane level and
activates only the precision required by each request. In this work, we present
AnyBCQ, a hardware-friendly multi-precision extension of Binary-Coded
Quantization (BCQ) that supports direct bit-plane operations. By representing
weights as binary bit-planes with corresponding scale factors, AnyBCQ enables
bit-plane-level computation and maps naturally to accelerator-friendly,
bit-parallel arithmetic. Our progressive precision expansion mechanism
incrementally refines scaling factors while reusing previously assigned binary
codes, yielding monotonic improvements in accuracy as additional bits are
enabled. We further co-design a specialized kernel that exploits the BCQ
structure to support dynamic per-request precision selection with negligible
overhead. Experiments on recent LLMs demonstrate that AnyBCQ significantly
narrows the accuracy drop in the low-bit regime (e.g. 2-bit), remains
competitive at higher precision, and achieves throughput gains of up to 3.0x
over half precision and 1.2x over state-of-the-art multi-precision methods. By
aligning algorithmic flexibility with hardware efficiency, AnyBCQ provides a
practical foundation for multi-precision LLM deployment across diverse
service-level objectives.

### [609] [Anchor-based Maximum Discrepancy for Relative Similarity Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10477)
*Zhijian Zhou,Liuhua Peng,Xunye Tian,Feng Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses relative similarity testing, which aims to determine the closer relationship of two distributions (P and Q) to an anchor distribution (U) using a novel approach called anchor-based maximum discrepancy (AMD). It resolves issues found in earlier methods, like dependency on manually specified hypotheses and fixed kernels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome limitations in existing kernel-based methods for relative similarity testing, such as the challenge of kernel selection under manually specified hypotheses and the ill-defined nature of the testing process.

Method: The paper introduces AMD, which defines relative similarity based on maximum discrepancy. A two-phase testing process is used: Phase I estimates AMD and infers hypotheses over deep kernel space; Phase II assesses hypothesis significance using a unified testing framework with derived thresholds.

Result: The proposed model is theoretically validated and demonstrated to be effective through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, showing improvement over traditional methods.

Conclusion: AMD offers a rigorous approach to relative similarity testing by addressing issues with kernel selection and hypothesis specification, ensuring clarity and effectiveness. The publicly available code facilitates further adoption and validation.

Abstract: The relative similarity testing aims to determine which of the distributions,
P or Q, is closer to an anchor distribution U. Existing kernel-based approaches
often test the relative similarity with a fixed kernel in a manually specified
alternative hypothesis, e.g., Q is closer to U than P. Although kernel
selection is known to be important to kernel-based testing methods, the
manually specified hypothesis poses a significant challenge for kernel
selection in relative similarity testing: Once the hypothesis is specified
first, we can always find a kernel such that the hypothesis is rejected. This
challenge makes relative similarity testing ill-defined when we want to select
a good kernel after the hypothesis is specified. In this paper, we cope with
this challenge via learning a proper hypothesis and a kernel simultaneously,
instead of learning a kernel after manually specifying the hypothesis. We
propose an anchor-based maximum discrepancy (AMD), which defines the relative
similarity as the maximum discrepancy between the distances of (U, P) and (U,
Q) in a space of deep kernels. Based on AMD, our testing incorporates two
phases. In Phase I, we estimate the AMD over the deep kernel space and infer
the potential hypothesis. In Phase II, we assess the statistical significance
of the potential hypothesis, where we propose a unified testing framework to
derive thresholds for tests over different possible hypotheses from Phase I.
Lastly, we validate our method theoretically and demonstrate its effectiveness
via extensive experiments on benchmark datasets. Codes are publicly available

TL;DR: RADiAnce introduces a novel framework for designing protein binders by combining retrieval and diffusion generation techniques. It significantly improves binding affinity and geometry recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of designing protein binders targeting specific sites with realistic and functional patterns motivates advancements in the drug discovery process.

Method: RADiAnce employs retrieval-augmented diffusion aligned with known interfaces, combining a shared contrastive latent space and conditional latent diffusion generation for cross-domain interface transfer.

Result: The framework outperforms baseline models on metrics like binding affinity and interaction recovery, showcasing cross-domain generalization by leveraging interfaces from different domains.

Conclusion: The study presents a paradigm shift in protein binder design, emphasizing the integration of retrieval-based knowledge with generative AI to advance drug discovery efforts.

Abstract: Designing protein binders targeting specific sites, which requires to
generate realistic and functional interaction patterns, is a fundamental
challenge in drug discovery. Current structure-based generative models are
limited in generating nterfaces with sufficient rationality and
interpretability. In this paper, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Diffusion for
Aligned interface (RADiAnce), a new framework that leverages known interfaces
to guide the design of novel binders. By unifying retrieval and generation in a
shared contrastive latent space, our model efficiently identifies relevant
interfaces for a given binding site and seamlessly integrates them through a
conditional latent diffusion generator, enabling cross-domain interface
transfer. Extensive exeriments show that RADiAnce significantly outperforms
baseline models across multiple metrics, including binding affinity and
recovery of geometries and interactions. Additional experimental results
validate cross-domain generalization, demonstrating that retrieving interfaces
from diverse domains, such as peptides, antibodies, and protein fragments,
enhances the generation performance of binders for other domains. Our work
establishes a new paradigm for protein binder design that successfully bridges
retrieval-based knowledge and generative AI, opening new possibilities for drug
discovery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Gradient Enhanced Self-Training PINN (gST-PINN) for solving PDEs, overcoming limitations of traditional PINNs like low precision and slow training. It shows superior performance in accuracy and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of conventional Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), such as low accuracy, slow training, and challenges with multi-physics interaction when solving PDEs.

Method: The gST-PINN method introduces a gradient-based pseudo-point self-learning algorithm to improve the performance of PINNs in solving PDEs.

Result: The method achieves lower mean square error (MSE) values compared to traditional PINNs and gPINNs across different PDE problems, even in semi-supervised scenarios.

Conclusion: gST-PINN outperforms standard PINN by improving accuracy, generalization, and training dynamics, especially under data-scarce conditions.

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) provide a mathematical foundation for
simulating and understanding intricate behaviors in both physical sciences and
engineering. With the growing capabilities of deep learning, data$-$driven
approaches like Physics$-$Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have been developed,
offering a mesh$-$free, analytic type framework for efficiently solving PDEs
across a wide range of applications. However, traditional PINNs often struggle
with challenges such as limited precision, slow training dynamics, lack of
labeled data availability, and inadequate handling of multi$-$physics
interactions. To overcome these challenging issues of PINNs, we proposed a
Gradient Enhanced Self$-$Training PINN (gST$-$PINN) method that specifically
introduces a gradient based pseudo point self$-$learning algorithm for solving
PDEs. We tested the proposed method on three different types of PDE problems
from various fields, each representing distinct scenarios. The effectiveness of
the proposed method is evident, as the PINN approach for solving the Burgers$'$
equation attains a mean square error (MSE) on the order of $10^{-3}$, while the
diffusion$-$sorption equation achieves an MSE on the order of $10^{-4}$ after
12,500 iterations, with no further improvement as the iterations increase. In
contrast, the MSE for both PDEs in the gST$-$PINN model continues to decrease,
demonstrating better generalization and reaching an MSE on the order of
$10^{-5}$ after 18,500 iterations. Furthermore, the results show that the
proposed purely semi$-$supervised gST$-$PINN consistently outperforms the
standard PINN method in all cases, even when solution of the PDEs are
unavailable. It generalizes both PINN and Gradient$-$enhanced PINN (gPINN), and
can be effectively applied in scenarios prone to low accuracy and convergence
issues, particularly in the absence of labeled data.

TL;DR: Existing influence estimation methods for machine learning are unreliable due to training randomness. This paper introduces a stable and efficient method, f-influence, applied successfully in large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unstable influence estimation methods hinder reliable data curation and cleanup in machine learning, as training randomness significantly affects their outcomes.

Method: The paper introduces f-influence, a hypothesis-testing grounded framework, and proposes an efficient algorithm (f-INE) for reliable influence estimation during a single training run.

Result: f-INE scales to large models like Llama-3.1-8B and detects poisoned samples steering model behavior, showing its utility for addressing data quality issues.

Conclusion: The f-influence framework offers a robust solution for influence estimation, facilitating reliable data cleanup and helping attribute model behaviors effectively.

Abstract: Influence estimation methods promise to explain and debug machine learning by
estimating the impact of individual samples on the final model. Yet, existing
methods collapse under training randomness: the same example may appear
critical in one run and irrelevant in the next. Such instability undermines
their use in data curation or cleanup since it is unclear if we indeed
deleted/kept the correct datapoints. To overcome this, we introduce
*f-influence* -- a new influence estimation framework grounded in hypothesis
testing that explicitly accounts for training randomness, and establish
desirable properties that make it suitable for reliable influence estimation.
We also design a highly efficient algorithm **f**-**IN**fluence **E**stimation
(**f-INE**) that computes f-influence **in a single training run**. Finally, we
scale up f-INE to estimate influence of instruction tuning data on Llama-3.1-8B
and show it can reliably detect poisoned samples that steer model opinions,
demonstrating its utility for data cleanup and attributing model behavior.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid framework to generate high-fidelity synthetic healthcare data that preserves privacy and emulates real-world statistics to overcome challenges in healthcare research caused by data scarcity and privacy regulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address data scarcity and privacy regulation limitations (e.g., HIPAA and GDPR), which constrain innovation and the development of robust AI models in healthcare research.

Method: A hybrid framework combining five data augmentation methods (noise injection, interpolation, GMM sampling, CVAE sampling, SMOTE) with reinforcement learning-based dynamic weight selection. The model integrates advanced calibration techniques to preserve statistical and feature dependencies.

Result: The proposed framework achieves extremely low discrepancy metrics (e.g., Wasserstein distance: 0.001) and high trend scores (above 90%), indicating strong data fidelity and privacy protection. It also enables downstream classifiers trained on synthetic data to achieve accuracy and F1 scores comparable to real data.

Conclusion: The approach provides a scalable and privacy-preserving solution, setting new benchmarks for joint-distribution fidelity in healthcare data synthesis while supporting sensitive AI applications.

Abstract: Healthcare research and development face significant obstacles due to data
scarcity and stringent privacy regulations, such as HIPAA and the GDPR,
restricting access to essential real-world medical data. These limitations
impede innovation, delay robust AI model creation, and hinder advancements in
patient-centered care. Synthetic data generation offers a transformative
solution by producing artificial datasets that emulate real data statistics
while safeguarding patient privacy. We introduce a novel hybrid framework for
high-fidelity healthcare data synthesis integrating five augmentation methods:
noise injection, interpolation, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) sampling,
Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) sampling, and SMOTE, combined via a
reinforcement learning-based dynamic weight selection mechanism. Its key
innovations include advanced calibration techniques -- moment matching, full
histogram matching, soft and adaptive soft histogram matching, and iterative
refinement -- that align marginal distributions and preserve joint feature
dependencies. Evaluated on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (UCI Repository) and
Khulna Medical College cardiology datasets, our calibrated hybrid achieves
Wasserstein distances as low as 0.001 and Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics around
0.01, demonstrating near-zero marginal discrepancy. Pairwise trend scores
surpass 90%, and Nearest Neighbor Adversarial Accuracy approaches 50%,
confirming robust privacy protection. Downstream classifiers trained on
synthetic data achieve up to 94% accuracy and F1 scores above 93%, comparable
to models trained on real data. This scalable, privacy-preserving approach
matches state-of-the-art methods, sets new benchmarks for joint-distribution
fidelity in healthcare, and supports sensitive AI applications.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework using reinforcement learning and feature disentanglement for unsupervised continuous domain adaptation (CDA), optimizing domain path selection and task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from overcoming challenges in selecting intermediate domains for CDA when explicit metadata is unavailable.

Method: The study proposes combining reinforcement learning and feature disentanglement to identify optimal transfer paths, using unsupervised rewards derived from latent domain embeddings.

Result: Extensive experiments on datasets like Rotated MNIST and ADNI show improved prediction accuracy and efficiency in domain path selection compared to traditional CDA methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method outperforms existing approaches in CDA, making domain adaptation processes more effective and efficient.

Abstract: Continuous Domain Adaptation (CDA) effectively bridges significant domain
shifts by progressively adapting from the source domain through intermediate
domains to the target domain. However, selecting intermediate domains without
explicit metadata remains a substantial challenge that has not been extensively
explored in existing studies. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel
framework that combines reinforcement learning with feature disentanglement to
conduct domain path selection in an unsupervised CDA setting. Our approach
introduces an innovative unsupervised reward mechanism that leverages the
distances between latent domain embeddings to facilitate the identification of
optimal transfer paths. Furthermore, by disentangling features, our method
facilitates the calculation of unsupervised rewards using domain-specific
features and promotes domain adaptation by aligning domain-invariant features.
This integrated strategy is designed to simultaneously optimize transfer paths
and target task performance, enhancing the effectiveness of domain adaptation
processes. Extensive empirical evaluations on datasets such as Rotated MNIST
and ADNI demonstrate substantial improvements in prediction accuracy and domain
selection efficiency, establishing our method's superiority over traditional
CDA approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Current RL benchmarks for LLMs fail to distinguish true performance progress due to lack of generalization evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address inadequacies in existing benchmarks for reinforcement learning applied to large language models, particularly their inability to effectively measure generalization and progress.

Method: The authors propose a diagnostic suite and the Oracle Performance Gap (OPG) metric to assess and quantify issues with current benchmarks. They also conduct stress tests to analyze generalization deficiencies.

Result: Findings reveal existing RL methods have limited capacity to generalize under distributional shifts, varying challenges, and counterfactuals, despite achieving strong scores on current benchmarks.

Conclusion: Current benchmarks are insufficient for evaluating RL progress on LLMs. The paper suggests designing improved benchmarks based on principles of difficulty, balanced evaluation, and robustness.

Abstract: Current benchmarks are inadequate for evaluating progress in reinforcement
learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs).Despite recent benchmark gains
reported for RL, we find that training on these benchmarks' training sets
achieves nearly the same performance as training directly on the test sets,
suggesting that the benchmarks cannot reliably separate further progress.To
study this phenomenon, we introduce a diagnostic suite and the Oracle
Performance Gap (OPG) metric that quantifies the performance difference between
training on the train split versus the test split of a benchmark. We further
analyze this phenomenon with stress tests and find that, despite strong
benchmark scores, existing RL methods struggle to generalize across
distribution shifts, varying levels of difficulty, and counterfactual
scenarios: shortcomings that current benchmarks fail to reveal.We conclude that
current benchmarks are insufficient for evaluating generalization and propose
three core principles for designing more faithful benchmarks: sufficient
difficulty, balanced evaluation, and distributional robustness.

*Weiming Zhao,Xulong Wang,Jun Qi,Yun Yang,Po Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduces a new model, MFAM, for better severity assessment of Parkinson's disease using wearable sensor data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional time-series models struggle with extracting features specific to Parkinson's disease due to temporal sparsity and lack of pathological specificity.

Method: The MFAM model integrates a frequency decomposition module guided by medical knowledge and an attention-based multi-instance learning framework to focus on diagnostically valuable sparse segments.

Result: MFAM shows superior performance compared to general-purpose time series models on both public and private datasets.

Conclusion: MFAM presents an effective approach for complex, automated clinical time-series analysis, specifically for Parkinson's disease severity assessment.

Abstract: Severity assessment of Parkinson's disease (PD) using wearable sensors offers
an effective, objective basis for clinical management. However, general-purpose
time series models often lack pathological specificity in feature extraction,
making it difficult to capture subtle signals highly correlated with
PD.Furthermore, the temporal sparsity of PD symptoms causes key diagnostic
features to be easily "diluted" by traditional aggregation methods, further
complicating assessment. To address these issues, we propose the Multi-scale
Frequency-Aware Adversarial Multi-Instance Network (MFAM). This model enhances
feature specificity through a frequency decomposition module guided by medical
prior knowledge. Furthermore, by introducing an attention-based multi-instance
learning (MIL) framework, the model can adaptively focus on the most
diagnostically valuable sparse segments.We comprehensively validated MFAM on
both the public PADS dataset for PD versus differential diagnosis (DD) binary

TL;DR: This paper theoretically formulates self-supervised learning as an approximation to supervised learning and derives insights into popular objectives like InfoNCE while improving algorithm effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Theoretical understanding of self-supervised learning is limited despite its empirical success; the paper aims to bridge this gap.

Method: Derivation of a loss function tied to InfoNCE, introducing prototype representation bias and balanced contrastive loss, and empirical validation of these concepts.

Result: Improved understanding and enhancement of self-supervised learning algorithms through theoretical and empirical analyses.

Conclusion: Self-supervised learning principles can be better understood and improved by aligning them with supervised objectives and addressing biases and pairing issues.

Abstract: Self-supervised representation learning has achieved impressive empirical
success, yet its theoretical understanding remains limited. In this work, we
provide a theoretical perspective by formulating self-supervised representation
learning as an approximation to supervised representation learning objectives.
Based on this formulation, we derive a loss function closely related to popular
contrastive losses such as InfoNCE, offering insight into their underlying
principles. Our derivation naturally introduces the concepts of prototype
representation bias and a balanced contrastive loss, which help explain and
improve the behavior of self-supervised learning algorithms. We further show
how components of our theoretical framework correspond to established practices
in contrastive learning. Finally, we empirically validate the effect of
balancing positive and negative pair interactions. All theoretical proofs are
provided in the appendix, and our code is included in the supplementary
material.

TL;DR: FusionGen, an EEG data generation framework, enhances BCI performance by addressing data scarcity and inter-subject variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in EEG-based BCIs caused by limited data and variability across subjects.

Method: FusionGen utilizes disentangled representation learning, feature fusion, and feature matching in a lightweight pipeline to create diverse EEG data.

Result: FusionGen showed substantial advancements in classification accuracy across various publicly available EEG datasets.

Conclusion: FusionGen presents a promising solution for improving EEG decoding models, making them more reliable and practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) provide potential for applications ranging
from medical rehabilitation to cognitive state assessment by establishing
direct communication pathways between the brain and external devices via
electroencephalography (EEG). However, EEG-based BCIs are severely constrained
by data scarcity and significant inter-subject variability, which hinder the
generalization and applicability of EEG decoding models in practical settings.
To address these challenges, we propose FusionGen, a novel EEG data generation
framework based on disentangled representation learning and feature fusion. By
integrating features across trials through a feature matching fusion module and
combining them with a lightweight feature extraction and reconstruction
pipeline, FusionGen ensures both data diversity and trainability under limited
data constraints. Extensive experiments on multiple publicly available EEG
datasets demonstrate that FusionGen significantly outperforms existing
augmentation techniques, yielding notable improvements in classification
accuracy.

*MohammadHossein Bateni,Hossein Esfandiari,Samira HosseinGhorban,Alireza Mirrokni,Radin Shahdaei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses how to effectively allocate limited resources to evaluate intermediate models in various processes like feature selection and parameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to optimize the exploration of intermediate models by efficiently using bounded budgets, crucial for enhancing model development processes.

Method: The approach is formulated as a budget allocation problem over unknown-value functions adhering to a Lipschitz space.

Result: The framework provides a strategic way to allocate resources for evaluating intermediary models under budgetary constraints.

Conclusion: The study advances methods in model development by integrating budget optimization principles into the exploration of intermediate models.

Abstract: Building learning models frequently requires evaluating numerous intermediate
models. Examples include models considered during feature selection, model
structure search, and parameter tunings. The evaluation of an intermediate
model influences subsequent model exploration decisions. Although prior
knowledge can provide initial quality estimates, true performance is only
revealed after evaluation. In this work, we address the challenge of optimally
allocating a bounded budget to explore the space of intermediate models. We
formalize this as a general budget allocation problem over unknown-value
functions within a Lipschitz space.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve stock price forecasting by overcoming issues inherent in GANs, such as mode collapse, unstable training, and difficulty in modeling temporal and feature-level correlations.

Method: The paper presents EDGAN, which incorporates a temporal decoder with residual connections, static and dynamic covariate conditioning, and a windowing mechanism. The generator uses a dense encoder-decoder framework with residual GRU blocks.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrated that EDGAN outperforms traditional GAN models in forecasting accuracy and stability, even under volatile market conditions.

Conclusion: The EDGAN model achieves superior accuracy and convergence stability in stock forecasting, making it a robust solution for this challenging domain.

Abstract: Forecasting stock prices remains challenging due to the volatile and
non-linear nature of financial markets. Despite the promise of deep learning,
issues such as mode collapse, unstable training, and difficulty in capturing
temporal and feature level correlations have limited the applications of GANs
in this domain. We propose a GRU-based Encoder-Decoder GAN (EDGAN) model that
strikes a balance between expressive power and simplicity. The model introduces
key innovations such as a temporal decoder with residual connections for
precise reconstruction, conditioning on static and dynamic covariates for
contextual learning, and a windowing mechanism to capture temporal dynamics.
Here, the generator uses a dense encoder-decoder framework with residual GRU
blocks. Extensive experiments on diverse stock datasets demonstrate that EDGAN
achieves superior forecasting accuracy and training stability, even in volatile
markets. It consistently outperforms traditional GAN variants in forecasting
accuracy and convergence stability under market conditions.

*Hanbing Liu,Yanru Wu,Yang Li,Ercan E. Kuruoglu,Xuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduces SDG-L, a semiparametric deep Gaussian process regression framework leveraging LSTM feature extraction to accurately predict lithium-ion battery capacity degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lithium-ion batteries suffer from declining storage capacities across charging/discharging cycles, threatening system longevity. Predicting battery capacity accurately is essential to ensure efficiency; however, battery state exploitation during cycles remains underutilized.

Method: The authors developed SDG-L, a semiparametric deep Gaussian process regression framework incorporating LSTM-based feature extraction to model time-series data of battery state information effectively.

Result: The SDG-L framework achieved an average test mean square error (MSE) of 1.2% on experimental data derived from the NASA dataset, outperforming existing methodologies and validated through ablation studies.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that SDG-L is capable of precise battery capacity predictions, outperforming previous approaches and showcasing the efficacy of combining semiparametric modeling with LSTM architectures.

Abstract: Lithium-ion batteries are becoming increasingly omnipresent in energy supply.
However, the durability of energy storage using lithium-ion batteries is
threatened by their dropping capacity with the growing number of
charging/discharging cycles. An accurate capacity prediction is the key to
ensure system efficiency and reliability, where the exploitation of battery
state information in each cycle has been largely undervalued. In this paper, we
propose a semiparametric deep Gaussian process regression framework named SDG-L
to give predictions based on the modeling of time series battery state data. By
introducing an LSTM feature extractor, the SDG-L is specially designed to
better utilize the auxiliary profiling information during charging/discharging
process. In experimental studies based on NASA dataset, our proposed method
obtains an average test MSE error of 1.2%. We also show that SDG-L achieves
better performance compared to existing works and validate the framework using
ablation studies.

*Yuval Golbari,Navve Wasserman,Gal Vardi,Michal Irani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces ImpMIA, a white-box Membership Inference Attack leveraging the implicit bias of neural networks, achieving state-of-the-art performance without relying on restrictive assumptions of black-box methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of black-box Membership Inference Attacks, which depend on unrealistic assumptions and struggle in real-world scenarios.

Method: ImpMIA leverages the implicit bias of neural networks. Using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions, it identifies training samples by analyzing gradients that best reconstruct the model's parameters.

Result: ImpMIA outperforms existing black-box and white-box attacks in identifying training samples, especially in realistic settings where only model weights and a training data superset are accessible.

Conclusion: ImpMIA removes the need for reference models and associated assumptions, making it a practical and robust approach for Membership Inference Attacks in increasingly common white-box scenarios.

Abstract: Determining which data samples were used to train a model-known as Membership
Inference Attack (MIA)-is a well-studied and important problem with
implications for data privacy. Black-box methods presume access only to the
model's outputs and often rely on training auxiliary reference models. While
they have shown strong empirical performance, they rely on assumptions that
rarely hold in real-world settings: (i) the attacker knows the training
hyperparameters; (ii) all available non-training samples come from the same
distribution as the training data; and (iii) the fraction of training data in
the evaluation set is known. In this paper, we demonstrate that removing these
assumptions leads to a significant drop in the performance of black-box
attacks. We introduce ImpMIA, a Membership Inference Attack that exploits the
Implicit Bias of neural networks, hence removes the need to rely on any
reference models and their assumptions. ImpMIA is a white-box attack -- a
setting which assumes access to model weights and is becoming increasingly
realistic given that many models are publicly available (e.g., via Hugging
Face). Building on maximum-margin implicit bias theory, ImpMIA uses the
Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions to identify training samples.
This is done by finding the samples whose gradients most strongly reconstruct
the trained model's parameters. As a result, ImpMIA achieves state-of-the-art
performance compared to both black and white box attacks in realistic settings
where only the model weights and a superset of the training data are available.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProteinAE introduces a streamlined approach to protein generative modeling by mapping protein backbone coordinates into a continuous latent space, simplifying optimization and improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in protein generative modeling related to manifold complexities, reliance on tokenization, and multi-objective training processes.

Method: ProteinAE employs a non-equivariant Diffusion Transformer with a bottleneck design, mapping protein coordinates into a compact latent space using a single flow matching objective.

Result: ProteinAE achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality, surpasses existing autoencoders, and facilitates efficient, high-performance structure generation.

Conclusion: ProteinAE establishes itself as a powerful tool in protein modeling, demonstrating competitive generative capabilities while simplifying the optimization process.

Abstract: Developing effective representations of protein structures is essential for
advancing protein science, particularly for protein generative modeling.
Current approaches often grapple with the complexities of the SE(3) manifold,
rely on discrete tokenization, or the need for multiple training objectives,
all of which can hinder the model optimization and generalization. We introduce
ProteinAE, a novel and streamlined protein diffusion autoencoder designed to
overcome these challenges by directly mapping protein backbone coordinates from
E(3) into a continuous, compact latent space. ProteinAE employs a
non-equivariant Diffusion Transformer with a bottleneck design for efficient
compression and is trained end-to-end with a single flow matching objective,
substantially simplifying the optimization pipeline. We demonstrate that
ProteinAE achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality, outperforming
existing autoencoders. The resulting latent space serves as a powerful
foundation for a latent diffusion model that bypasses the need for explicit
equivariance. This enables efficient, high-quality structure generation that is
competitive with leading structure-based approaches and significantly
outperforms prior latent-based methods. Code is available at

TL;DR: RetroTrim is introduced as a retrosynthesis system capable of avoiding nonsensical synthetic plans and producing high-quality paths, using diverse reaction scoring strategies and expert evaluation protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to tackle the issue of nonsensical outputs (hallucinations) in generative retrosynthesis systems, which can heavily detract from the reliability of synthetic plans.

Method: RetroTrim employs a combination of diverse reaction scoring strategies using machine learning models and chemical databases. A novel evaluation protocol involving expert reviews is proposed for assessing reliability.

Result: Compared to baselines, RetroTrim successfully filters hallucinated reactions and achieves the highest number of high-quality synthetic paths on challenging drug-like targets.

Conclusion: RetroTrim is an effective tool for drug-like target retrosynthesis systems. By sharing benchmark data and protocols, the paper seeks to foster further advancements in reliable retrosynthesis research.

Abstract: Retrosynthesis is one of the domains transformed by the rise of generative
models, and it is one where the problem of nonsensical or erroneous outputs
(hallucinations) is particularly insidious: reliable assessment of synthetic
plans is time-consuming, with automatic methods lacking. In this work, we
present RetroTrim, a retrosynthesis system that successfully avoids nonsensical
plans on a set of challenging drug-like targets. Compared to common baselines
in the field, our system is not only the sole method that succeeds in filtering
out hallucinated reactions, but it also results in the highest number of
high-quality paths overall. The key insight behind RetroTrim is the combination
of diverse reaction scoring strategies, based on machine learning models and
existing chemical databases. We show that our scoring strategies capture
different classes of hallucinations by analyzing them on a dataset of labeled
retrosynthetic intermediates. To measure the performance of retrosynthesis
systems, we propose a novel evaluation protocol for reactions and synthetic
paths based on a structured review by expert chemists. Using this protocol, we
compare systems on a set of 32 novel targets, curated to reflect recent trends
in drug structures. While the insights behind our methodology are broadly
applicable to retrosynthesis, our focus is on targets in the drug-like domain.
By releasing our benchmark targets and the details of our evaluation protocol,
we hope to inspire further research into reliable retrosynthesis.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a lifecycle-focused Control Co-Design (CCD) framework enhanced by Digital Twins (DT) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to optimize dynamic system performance under uncertainties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address dynamic and unpredictable uncertainties in real-world Control Co-Design (CCD) by integrating system lifecycle data and adaptive technologies.

Method: Proposes a DT-enabled CCD framework with DRL to optimize physical and controller designs through multi-generation updates informed by real-time sensing, model updates, and adaptive re-optimization.

Result: Demonstrated on an active suspension system, the method improved smoothness, stability, dynamic performance, robustness, and efficiency across lifecycle stages.

Conclusion: The framework advances CCD by incorporating multi-generation design, DTs for ongoing updates, and DRL for accelerated adaptive decision-making, significantly improving the system's lifecycle performance.

Abstract: Control Co-Design (CCD) integrates physical and control system design to
improve the performance of dynamic and autonomous systems. Despite advances in
uncertainty-aware CCD methods, real-world uncertainties remain highly
unpredictable. Multi-generation design addresses this challenge by considering
the full lifecycle of a product: data collected from each generation informs
the design of subsequent generations, enabling progressive improvements in
robustness and efficiency. Digital Twin (DT) technology further strengthens
this paradigm by creating virtual representations that evolve over the
lifecycle through real-time sensing, model updating, and adaptive
re-optimization. This paper presents a DT-enabled CCD framework that integrates
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to jointly optimize physical design and
controller. DRL accelerates real-time decision-making by allowing controllers
to continuously learn from data and adapt to uncertain environments. Extending
this approach, the framework employs a multi-generation paradigm, where each
cycle of deployment, operation, and redesign uses collected data to refine DT
models, improve uncertainty quantification through quantile regression, and
inform next-generation designs of both physical components and controllers. The
framework is demonstrated on an active suspension system, where DT-enabled
learning from road conditions and driving behaviors yields smoother and more
stable control trajectories. Results show that the method significantly
enhances dynamic performance, robustness, and efficiency. Contributions of this
work include: (1) extending CCD into a lifecycle-oriented multi-generation
framework, (2) leveraging DTs for continuous model updating and informed
design, and (3) employing DRL to accelerate adaptive real-time decision-making.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Dual Relation Fusion Network (DRFN) to model inter-stock relationships dynamically and statically for better stock price forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for stock price prediction mostly overlook the interplay between dynamic and static inter-stock relationships, affecting performance in adapting to market changes.

Method: The authors propose the DRFN, integrating a relative static relation model for long-term stability and a dynamic relation model for flexibility. These are fused recurrently, incorporating novel components like distance-aware mechanisms and overnight information.

Result: Experimental results show that DRFN outperforms baseline models across different markets, particularly in tracking relational strength and stock price co-movements.

Conclusion: The DRFN effectively captures both static and dynamic inter-stock relationships, improving the accuracy and adaptability of stock price forecasting methods.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of inter-stock relationships is critical for stock price
forecasting. However, existing methods predominantly focus on single-state
relationships, neglecting the essential complementarity between dynamic and
static inter-stock relations. To solve this problem, we propose a Dual Relation
Fusion Network (DRFN) to capture the long-term relative stability of stock
relation structures while retaining the flexibility to respond to sudden market
shifts. Our approach features a novel relative static relation component that
models time-varying long-term patterns and incorporates overnight informational
influences. We capture dynamic inter-stock relationships through distance-aware
mechanisms, while evolving long-term structures via recurrent fusion of dynamic
relations from the prior day with the pre-defined static relations. Experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the baselines across
different markets, with high sensitivity to the co-movement of relational
strength and stock price.

*Usman Gani Joy,Shahadat kabir,Tasnim Niger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study presents an advanced LSTM model with attention mechanisms that outperforms traditional models for temperature and rainfall forecasting in Bangladesh, critical for addressing climate change impacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing forecasting models fail to adequately capture complex temporal patterns and long-term dependencies in climate data. Precise predictions are critical for climate adaptation in vulnerable areas like Bangladesh.

Method: An LSTM model integrated with attention mechanisms was developed and trained on comprehensive datasets (1901-2023) from NASA and other sources for improved accuracy in forecasting temperature and rainfall.

Result: The model achieved superior performance metrics (e.g., R^2 of 0.9834 for temperature and R^2 of 0.9639 for rainfall) compared to baseline models. It showed improved robustness under simulated climate trends and regional variations.

Conclusion: The enhanced LSTM model significantly improves forecasting accuracy and robustness, offering valuable insights into climate variability for effective decision-making in climate-sensitive sectors in Bangladesh.

Abstract: Accurate climate forecasting is vital for Bangladesh, a region highly
susceptible to climate change impacts on temperature and rainfall. Existing
models often struggle to capture long-range dependencies and complex temporal
patterns in climate data. This study introduces an advanced Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) model integrated with an attention mechanism to enhance the
prediction of temperature and rainfall dynamics. Utilizing comprehensive
datasets from 1901-2023, sourced from NASA's POWER Project for temperature and
the Humanitarian Data Exchange for rainfall, the model effectively captures
seasonal and long-term trends. It outperforms baseline models, including
XGBoost, Simple LSTM, and GRU, achieving a test MSE of 0.2411 (normalized
units), MAE of 0.3860 degrees C, R^2 of 0.9834, and NRMSE of 0.0370 for
temperature, and MSE of 1283.67 mm^2, MAE of 22.91 mm, R^2 of 0.9639, and NRMSE
of 0.0354 for rainfall on monthly forecasts. The model demonstrates improved
robustness with only a 20 percent increase in MSE under simulated climate
trends (compared to an approximately 2.2-fold increase in baseline models
without trend features) and a 50 percent degradation under regional variations
(compared to an approximately 4.8-fold increase in baseline models without
enhancements). These results highlight the model's ability to improve
forecasting precision and offer potential insights into the physical processes
governing climate variability in Bangladesh, supporting applications in
climate-sensitive sectors.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses generating trees with a specific tree edit distance using ReLU-based generative networks, demonstrating theoretical foundations and superior validity over existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of clarity on suitable generative networks for synthesizing tree-structured data with a specified tree edit distance, despite its importance in computational biology and data analysis.

Method: The paper theoretically establishes constructions for ReLU-based generative networks, with size O(n^3) and constant depth, to generate trees meeting specific tree edit distance criteria.

Result: The proposed networks successfully generated all valid trees within the specified edit distance, significantly outperforming existing models like GraphRNN and GraphGDP which had validation rates of 35% and 48%.

Conclusion: The deterministic architecture of the proposed networks offers a compact and efficient solution for precise tree generation, paving the way for advancements in valid tree-structured data generation.

Abstract: The generation of trees with a specified tree edit distance has significant
applications across various fields, including computational biology, structured
data analysis, and image processing. Recently, generative networks have been
increasingly employed to synthesize new data that closely resembles the
original datasets. However, the appropriate size and depth of generative
networks required to generate data with a specified tree edit distance remain
unclear. In this paper, we theoretically establish the existence and
construction of generative networks capable of producing trees similar to a
given tree with respect to the tree edit distance. Specifically, for a given
rooted, ordered, and vertex-labeled tree T of size n + 1 with labels from an
alphabet \Sigma, and a non-negative integer d, we prove that all rooted,
ordered, and vertex-labeled trees over \Sigma with tree edit distance at most d
from T can be generated using a ReLU-based generative network with size O(n^3 )
and constant depth. The proposed networks were implemented and evaluated for
generating trees with up to 21 nodes. Due to their deterministic architecture,
the networks successfully generated all valid trees within the specified tree
edit distance. In contrast, state-of-the-art graph generative models GraphRNN
and GraphGDP, which rely on non-deterministic mechanisms, produced
significantly fewer valid trees, achieving validation rates of only up to 35%
and 48%, respectively. These findings provide a theoretical foundation towards
construction of compact generative models and open new directions for exact and
valid tree-structured data generation. An implementation of the proposed
networks is available at https://github.com/MGANN-KU/TreeGen_ReLUNetworks.

*Shaharyar Ahmed Khan Tareen,Filza Khan Tareen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Optimally Deep Networks (ODNs), which adapt model depth based on task complexity, improving computational efficiency and reducing memory usage without compromising accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiency of training unnecessarily deep neural networks for tasks that do not require high model capacity, which results in wasted computation, high energy consumption, and difficulties in deploying models on resource-constrained devices.

Method: The method involves a training strategy called progressive depth expansion, where the model starts at a shallow depth and increments its depth as earlier blocks converge, continuing until target accuracy is reached and redundant layers are removed.

Result: Empirical results show significant memory footprint reduction of 98.64% and 96.44% for ResNet-18 and ResNet-34 on MNIST and SVHN datasets, respectively, while maintaining competitive accuracies of 99.31% and 96.08%.

Conclusion: The proposed ODNs achieve optimal balance between model depth and task complexity, improving computational efficiency, reducing memory and deployment costs, and facilitating use on edge devices without compromising performance.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have provided brilliant performance across
various tasks. However, this success often comes at the cost of unnecessarily
large model sizes, high computational demands, and substantial memory
footprints. Typically, powerful architectures are trained at full depths but
not all datasets or tasks require such high model capacity. Training very deep
architectures on relatively low-complexity datasets frequently leads to wasted
computation, unnecessary energy consumption, and excessive memory usage, which
in turn makes deployment of models on resource-constrained devices impractical.
To address this problem, we introduce Optimally Deep Networks (ODNs), which
provide a balance between model depth and task complexity. Specifically, we
propose a NAS like training strategy called progressive depth expansion, which
begins by training deep networks at shallower depths and incrementally
increases their depth as the earlier blocks converge, continuing this process
until the target accuracy is reached. ODNs use only the optimal depth for the
given datasets, removing redundant layers. This cuts down future training and
inference costs, lowers the memory footprint, enhances computational
efficiency, and facilitates deployment on edge devices. Empirical results show
that the optimal depths of ResNet-18 and ResNet-34 for MNIST and SVHN, achieve
up to 98.64 % and 96.44 % reduction in memory footprint, while maintaining a
competitive accuracy of 99.31 % and 96.08 %, respectively.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the mismatch between stochastic samplers used during training and deterministic samplers used during inference for diffusion models fine-tuned with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). It introduces theoretical bounds for the reward gap and validates their findings with experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the reward gap that arises due to differences in stochastic sampling during training and deterministic sampling during inference, ultimately aiming for high-quality model outputs.

Method: Theoretically characterizing the reward gap with bounds for diffusion models and utilizing the generalized denoising diffusion implicit models (gDDIM) framework to incorporate high stochasticity while preserving data marginals. Empirical validation is carried out using DDPO and MixGRPO on text-to-image models.

Result: Experimental findings show that reward gaps reduce as training progresses, and deterministic ODE sampling quality improves with models trained using higher-stochasticity SDE.

Conclusion: Reward gap issues can be minimized with higher-stochasticity training methods, leading to improved ODE sampling quality during inference.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is increasingly used to
fine-tune diffusion models, but a key challenge arises from the mismatch
between stochastic samplers used during training and deterministic samplers
used during inference. In practice, models are fine-tuned using stochastic SDE
samplers to encourage exploration, while inference typically relies on
deterministic ODE samplers for efficiency and stability. This discrepancy
induces a reward gap, raising concerns about whether high-quality outputs can
be expected during inference. In this paper, we theoretically characterize this
reward gap and provide non-vacuous bounds for general diffusion models, along
with sharper convergence rates for Variance Exploding (VE) and Variance
Preserving (VP) Gaussian models. Methodologically, we adopt the generalized
denoising diffusion implicit models (gDDIM) framework to support arbitrarily
high levels of stochasticity, preserving data marginals throughout.
Empirically, our findings through large-scale experiments on text-to-image
models using denoising diffusion policy optimization (DDPO) and mixed group
relative policy optimization (MixGRPO) validate that reward gaps consistently
narrow over training, and ODE sampling quality improves when models are updated
using higher-stochasticity SDE training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Graph Neural Network (GNN) models in financial markets struggle to effectively propagate messages and model inter-stock relationships during macroeconomic shocks.

Method: OmniGNN is an attention-based multi-relational dynamic GNN that uses a sector node as a global intermediary, Graph Attention Networks (GAT) for neighbor influence, and Transformers for capturing temporal dynamics.

Result: OmniGNN outperforms existing stock prediction models, showing particular robustness during significant events like the COVID-19 period, based on experiments with public datasets.

Conclusion: OmniGNN effectively addresses the challenge of message propagation during macroeconomic shocks, providing robust and accurate stock predictions by leveraging macroeconomic contexts and advanced GNN architectures.

Abstract: In financial markets, Graph Neural Networks have been successfully applied to
modeling relational data, effectively capturing nonlinear inter-stock
dependencies. Yet, existing models often fail to efficiently propagate messages
during macroeconomic shocks. In this paper, we propose OmniGNN, an
attention-based multi-relational dynamic GNN that integrates macroeconomic
context via heterogeneous node and edge types for robust message passing.
Central to OmniGNN is a sector node acting as a global intermediary, enabling
rapid shock propagation across the graph without relying on long-range
multi-hop diffusion. The model leverages Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to
weigh neighbor contributions and employs Transformers to capture temporal
dynamics across multiplex relations. Experiments show that OmniGNN outperforms
existing stock prediction models on public datasets, particularly demonstrating

*Andrey Veprikov,Arman Bolatov,Samuel Horváth,Aleksandr Beznosikov,Martin Takáč,Slavomir Hanzely*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper generalizes existing optimization methods in deep learning by introducing preconditioned matrix norms, leading to novel and improved optimization techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current optimization methods in deep learning face a trade-off between adapting to different problem geometries and leveraging curvature information.

Method: The paper introduces the concept of preconditioned matrix norms to unify and extend steepest descent, quasi-Newton methods, and adaptive optimization techniques. It also establishes theoretical invariance properties and proposes new optimization algorithms (MuAdam and MuAdam-SANIA).

Result: The proposed methods demonstrate competitive performance and occasionally surpass existing state-of-the-art optimization techniques across various tests.

Conclusion: The novel framework and methods improve the flexibility and effectiveness of optimization in deep learning while unifying diverse approaches. Theoretical insights and practical advancements are both provided.

Abstract: Optimization lies at the core of modern deep learning, yet existing methods
often face a fundamental trade-off between adapting to problem geometry and
leveraging curvature utilization. Steepest descent algorithms adapt to
different geometries through norm choices but remain strictly first-order,
whereas quasi-Newton and adaptive optimizers incorporate curvature information
but are restricted to Frobenius geometry, limiting their applicability across
diverse architectures. In this work, we propose a unified framework
generalizing steepest descent, quasi-Newton methods, and adaptive methods
through the novel notion of preconditioned matrix norms. This abstraction
reveals that widely used optimizers such as SGD and Adam, as well as more
advanced approaches like Muon and KL-Shampoo, and recent hybrids including SOAP
and SPlus, all emerge as special cases of the same principle. Within this
framework, we provide the first systematic treatment of affine and scale
invariance in the matrix-parameterized setting, establishing necessary and
sufficient conditions under generalized norms. Building on this foundation, we
introduce two new methods, $\texttt{MuAdam}$ and $\texttt{MuAdam-SANIA}$, which
combine the spectral geometry of Muon with Adam-style preconditioning. Our
experiments demonstrate that these optimizers are competitive with, and in some
cases outperform, existing state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at

### [633] [BioOSS: A Bio-Inspired Oscillatory State System with Spatio-Temporal Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10790)
*Zhongju Yuan,Geraint Wiggins,Dick Botteldooren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a bio-inspired neural model called BioOSS, designed to mimic wave-like propagation dynamics found in the prefrontal cortex for better neural processing representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models, primarily based on perceptrons, fail to capture the oscillatory and intricate interactions observed in biological neural circuits, thereby motivating the creation of a biologically inspired system.

Method: The authors propose BioOSS, which comprises interacting neuron populations (p neurons and o neurons) that emulate wave-like dynamics through local interactions. Trainable parameters enable task-specific adaptability of spatio-temporal properties.

Result: BioOSS was tested on synthetic and real-world tasks, showing improved performance and interpretability compared to other architectures.

Conclusion: BioOSS effectively models biologically realistic neural dynamics and offers a flexible, interpretable, and high-performing alternative to traditional deep learning architectures.

Abstract: Today's deep learning architectures are primarily based on perceptron models,
which do not capture the oscillatory dynamics characteristic of biological
neurons. Although oscillatory systems have recently gained attention for their
closer resemblance to neural behavior, they still fall short of modeling the
intricate spatio-temporal interactions observed in natural neural circuits. In
this paper, we propose a bio-inspired oscillatory state system (BioOSS)
designed to emulate the wave-like propagation dynamics critical to neural
processing, particularly in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), where complex activity
patterns emerge. BioOSS comprises two interacting populations of neurons: p
neurons, which represent simplified membrane-potential-like units inspired by
pyramidal cells in cortical columns, and o neurons, which govern propagation
velocities and modulate the lateral spread of activity. Through local
interactions, these neurons produce wave-like propagation patterns. The model
incorporates trainable parameters for damping and propagation speed, enabling
flexible adaptation to task-specific spatio-temporal structures. We evaluate
BioOSS on both synthetic and real-world tasks, demonstrating superior
performance and enhanced interpretability compared to alternative
architectures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Linear regression outperforms LSTM and Temporal Fusion Transformer in predicting terrestrial water storage (TWS), emphasizing the need for traditional benchmarks and globally representative datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the effectiveness of complex machine learning models like LSTM and Transformers in predicting TWS, a task influenced by natural variability and human-driven changes.

Method: The researchers evaluated the performance of LSTM, Transformers, and linear regression on the HydroGlobe dataset, which includes both baseline and advanced versions derived from model simulations and remote sensing data.

Result: Linear regression demonstrated better performance than LSTM and Transformers for TWS prediction, questioning the superiority of deep learning models in this domain.

Conclusion: Traditional statistical models should remain as benchmarks, and globally representative datasets need to capture both natural and human-induced impacts for accurate assessments.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
models and Transformers have been widely adopted in hydrological applications,
demonstrating impressive performance amongst deep learning models and
outperforming physical models in various tasks. However, their superiority in
predicting land surface states such as terrestrial water storage (TWS) that are
dominated by many factors such as natural variability and human driven
modifications remains unclear. Here, using the open-access, globally
representative HydroGlobe dataset - comprising a baseline version derived
solely from a land surface model simulation and an advanced version
incorporating multi-source remote sensing data assimilation - we show that
linear regression is a robust benchmark, outperforming the more complex LSTM
and Temporal Fusion Transformer for TWS prediction. Our findings highlight the
importance of including traditional statistical models as benchmarks when
developing and evaluating deep learning models. Additionally, we emphasize the
critical need to establish globally representative benchmark datasets that
capture the combined impact of natural variability and human interventions.

*Javier García-Sigüenza,Mirco Nanni,Faraón Llorens-Largo,José F. Vicent*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel deep learning model for integrated graph pruning during training, enhancing explainability and simplifying spatio-temporal problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in spatio-temporal problems by integrating explainability into the problem and optimizing graph pruning.

Method: A deep learning model that incorporates a pruning mechanism to remove irrelevant graph nodes during training, helping identify the most important elements.

Result: The proposed method showed superior performance in retaining critical graph information while reducing graph size, compared to other pruning methods, on traffic datasets.

Conclusion: The study validates the potential of integrated pruning mechanisms in simplifying spatio-temporal problems and enhancing explainability by isolating key graph elements.

Abstract: This work addresses the challenge of using a deep learning model to prune
graphs and the ability of this method to integrate explainability into
spatio-temporal problems through a new approach. Instead of applying
explainability to the model's behavior, we seek to gain a better understanding
of the problem itself. To this end, we propose a novel model that integrates an
optimized pruning mechanism capable of removing nodes from the graph during the
training process, rather than doing so as a separate procedure. This
integration allows the architecture to learn how to minimize prediction error
while selecting the most relevant nodes. Thus, during training, the model
searches for the most relevant subset of nodes, obtaining the most important
elements of the problem, facilitating its analysis. To evaluate the proposed
approach, we used several widely used traffic datasets, comparing the accuracy
obtained by pruning with the model and with other methods. The experiments
demonstrate that our method is capable of retaining a greater amount of
information as the graph reduces in size compared to the other methods used.
These results highlight the potential of pruning as a tool for developing
models capable of simplifying spatio-temporal problems, thereby obtaining their
most important elements.

### [636] [Crisis-Aware Regime-Conditioned Diffusion with CVaR Allocation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10807)
*Ali Atiah Alzahrani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study introduces MARCD, a methodology combining latent regime detection, regime-specific generative modeling, and CVaR optimization to enhance portfolio management. MARCD demonstrates superior performance in mitigating drawdowns and improving Sharpe ratios compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of improving portfolio allocation under financial regime shifts, particularly during crises, by leveraging sophisticated generative modeling and risk-focused optimization techniques.

Method: The approach includes three components: (1) identifying latent market regimes using a Gaussian HMM, (2) training a diffusion model with a tail-weighted objective and regime-specific MoE denoiser, and (3) feeding these scenarios into a CVaR optimization program with governance constraints.

Result: In out-of-sample tests from 2020-2025, MARCD shows significant outperformance, achieving a Sharpe ratio of 1.23 and a MaxDD reduction to 9.3% versus a baseline Sharpe of 1.02 and MaxDD of 14.1%. Uplift in performance is statistically significant.

Conclusion: MARCD effectively combines generative scenario modeling and risk-sensitive portfolio optimization, offering substantial improvements in risk-adjusted returns and drawdown control, and is backed by robust theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: We study whether regime-conditioned generative scenarios, coupled with a
convex CVaR allocator, improve portfolio decisions under regime shifts. We
introduce Multi-Agent Regime-Conditioned Diffusion (MARCD), which (i) infers
latent regimes via a Gaussian HMM, (ii) trains a diffusion model with a
tail-weighted objective and a regime-specialized mixture-of-experts (MoE)
denoiser to enrich crisis co-movements, and (iii) feeds the generated scenarios
into a turnover-aware CVaR epigraph quadratic program with explicit governance.
In strict walk-forward tests on liquid multi-asset ETFs (2005-2025), MARCD
outperforms standard allocators and improves calibration relative to popular
generators. Over 2020-2025 out-of-sample (monthly; 10 bps), MARCD attains
Sharpe 1.23 (BL 1.02) and MaxDD 9.3 percent (BL 14.1 percent), a 34 percent
reduction, at comparable turnover; stationary block-bootstrap intervals
indicate the Sharpe uplift is significant at 5 percent. We provide theory
linking tail-weighted diffusion to spectral-risk control of the
decision-relevant CVaR gap, oracle/consistency results for the regime-MoE
denoiser, and Lipschitz/regret guarantees for the allocator. Together, MARCD
offers a reproducible bridge from tail-faithful scenario modeling to governed
portfolio decisions with materially improved drawdown control.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AEGIS is a framework for optimizing the utility of anonymized datasets used in machine learning by efficiently determining the ideal masking configuration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of balancing privacy and utility in data-sharing ecosystems, while identifying the optimal way to anonymize datasets for downstream tasks.

Method: AEGIS consists of a utility optimizer minimizing predictive utility deviation, leveraging feature-label joint distribution estimation using iterative proportional fitting and correlation quantification methods.

Result: AEGIS drastically accelerates identifying optimal masking configurations and maintains predictive performance comparable to baseline approaches on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed middleware framework enables efficient anonymization while preserving privacy and high utility for machine learning applications, making it a viable solution for private data-sharing.

Abstract: Data-sharing ecosystems enable entities -- such as providers, consumers, and
intermediaries -- to access, exchange, and utilize data for various downstream
tasks and applications. Due to privacy concerns, data providers typically
anonymize datasets before sharing them; however, the existence of multiple
masking configurations results in masked datasets with varying utility.
Consequently, a key challenge lies in efficiently determining the optimal
masking configuration that maximizes a dataset's utility. This paper presents
AEGIS, a middleware framework for identifying the optimal masking configuration
for machine learning datasets that consist of features and a class label. We
introduce a utility optimizer that minimizes predictive utility deviation -- a
metric based on the changes in feature-label correlations before and after
masking. Our framework leverages limited data summaries (such as 1D histograms)
or none to estimate the feature-label joint distribution, making it suitable
for scenarios where raw data is inaccessible due to privacy restrictions. To
achieve this, we propose a joint distribution estimator based on iterative
proportional fitting, which allows supporting various feature-label correlation
quantification methods such as g3, mutual information, or chi-square. Our
experimental evaluation on real-world datasets shows that AEGIS identifies
optimal masking configurations over an order of magnitude faster, while the
resulting masked datasets achieve predictive performance on downstream ML tasks
that is on par with baseline approaches.

### [638] [Glance for Context: Learning When to Leverage LLMs for Node-Aware GNN-LLM Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10849)
*Donald Loveland,Yao-An Yang,Danai Koutra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GLANCE, a framework that selectively combines GNNs and LLMs to improve graph learning performance, especially on complex node patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve the limitations of uniform GNN-LLM fusion strategies, which hinder performance gains and fail to adapt to nodes where GNNs alone underperform.

Method: GLANCE uses an adaptive lightweight router trained with an advantage-based objective to decide whether specific nodes should query an LLM or rely on a GNN, optimizing computation and performance.

Result: GLANCE outperforms existing architectures, achieving up to 13% improvement on heterophilous nodes and maintaining scalable deployment on large graphs.

Conclusion: This adaptive GNN-LLM fusion approach highlights the potential of node-specific strategies for performance gains while keeping computational costs manageable.

Abstract: Learning on text-attributed graphs has motivated the use of Large Language
Models (LLMs) for graph learning. However, most fusion strategies are applied
uniformly across all nodes and attain only small overall performance gains. We
argue this result stems from aggregate metrics that obscure when LLMs provide
benefit, inhibiting actionable signals for new strategies. In this work, we
reframe LLM-GNN fusion around nodes where GNNs typically falter. We first show
that performance can significantly differ between GNNs and LLMs, with each
excelling on distinct structural patterns, such as local homophily. To leverage
this finding, we propose GLANCE (GNN with LLM Assistance for Neighbor- and
Context-aware Embeddings), a framework that invokes an LLM to refine a GNN's
prediction. GLANCE employs a lightweight router that, given inexpensive
per-node signals, decides whether to query the LLM. Since the LLM calls are
non-differentiable, the router is trained with an advantage-based objective
that compares the utility of querying the LLM against relying solely on the
GNN. Across multiple benchmarks, GLANCE achieves the best performance balance
across node subgroups, achieving significant gains on heterophilous nodes (up
to $+13\%$) while simultaneously achieving top overall performance. Our
findings highlight the value of adaptive, node-aware GNN-LLM architectures,
where selectively invoking the LLM enables scalable deployment on large graphs
without incurring high computational costs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the relationship between graph heterophily and spectral filtering, emphasizing the need for adaptive filters in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). It introduces a novel GNN approach achieving enhanced performance across various graph types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitations of existing fixed filter designs in GNNs, which assume a simple correlation between graph heterophily and the type of spectral filters used.

Method: The researchers propose an adaptive filtering approach through a new GNN model that captures diverse frequency responses and combines representations for varying heterophily levels.

Result: The proposed method shows significant improvements, with up to 9.2% accuracy gain over existing baselines for both homophilic and heterophilic graphs.

Conclusion: Adaptive graph filters are crucial for maintaining GNN expressiveness, and the proposed method effectively generalizes and improves performance by adapting to varying heterophily degrees.

Abstract: Graph heterophily, where connected nodes have different labels, has attracted
significant interest recently. Most existing works adopt a simplified approach
- using low-pass filters for homophilic graphs and high-pass filters for
heterophilic graphs. However, we discover that the relationship between graph
heterophily and spectral filters is more complex - the optimal filter response
varies across frequency components and does not follow a strict monotonic
correlation with heterophily degree. This finding challenges conventional fixed
filter designs and suggests the need for adaptive filtering to preserve
expressiveness in graph embeddings. Formally, natural questions arise: Given a
heterophilic graph G, how and to what extent will the varying heterophily
degree of G affect the performance of GNNs? How can we design adaptive filters
to fit those varying heterophilic connections? Our theoretical analysis reveals
that the average frequency response of GNNs and graph heterophily degree do not
follow a strict monotonic correlation, necessitating adaptive graph filters to
guarantee good generalization performance. Hence, we propose [METHOD NAME], a
simple yet powerful GNN, which extracts information across the heterophily
spectrum and combines salient representations through adaptive mixing. [METHOD
NAME]'s superior performance achieves up to 9.2% accuracy improvement over
leading baselines across homophilic and heterophilic graphs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces LPCVAE, a Conditional Variational AutoEncoder that enhances time series anomaly detection (TSAD) by combining long-term dependency modeling with probabilistic time-frequency fusion. It outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this study is to address the limitations in existing VAE-based TSAD methods, which struggle with single-window feature dependency and fail to sufficiently utilize long-term time and frequency information.

Method: The authors propose LPCVAE, which incorporates LSTM for capturing long-term dependencies and a Product-of-Experts (PoE) mechanism for adaptive and probabilistic time-frequency fusion, preventing information loss.

Result: Experiments on four open datasets reveal that LPCVAE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art TSAD methods, confirming its robustness and efficiency.

Conclusion: Integrating long-term dependencies and adaptive time-frequency fusion in TSAD models generates more accurate and reliable anomaly detection, as evidenced by the superior results of LPCVAE compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection(TSAD) is a critical task in signal processing
field, ensuring the reliability of complex systems. Reconstruction-based
methods dominate in TSAD. Among these methods, VAE-based methods have achieved
promising results. Existing VAE-based methods suffer from the limitation of
single-window feature and insufficient leveraging of long-term time and
frequency information. We propose a Conditional Variational AutoEncoder with
Long-term dependency and Probabilistic time-frequency fusion, named LPCVAE.
LPCVAE introduces LSTM to capture long-term dependencies beyond windows. It
further incorporates a Product-of-Experts (PoE) mechanism for adaptive and
distribution-level probabilistic fusion. This design effectively mitigates
time-frequency information loss. Extensive experiments on four public datasets
demonstrate it outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The results confirm that
integrating long-term time and frequency representations with adaptive fusion
yields a robust and efficient solution for TSAD.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PerSyn, a method to synthesize personalized data for student-teacher learning models, improving student model performance more efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stronger teacher models are not always optimal for students due to a mismatch between teacher outputs and student learnability.

Method: The proposed method, PerSyn, uses a 'Route then Generate' paradigm to assign prompts to optimal teacher models based on both student learnability and teacher response quality, enabling more efficient data synthesis.

Result: PerSyn demonstrates better or comparable performance compared to baselines in instruct tuning and math reasoning tasks across various models.

Conclusion: PerSyn effectively tailors synthetic data to improve student learning, offering efficiency and insights for future research in student-teacher frameworks.

Abstract: Training student models on synthetic data generated by strong teacher models
is a promising way to distilling the capabilities of teachers. However, recent
studies show that stronger models are not always optimal teachers, revealing a
mismatch between teacher outputs and student learnability. To address this
issue, we propose PerSyn (Personalized data Synthesis), a novel synthesis
strategy that operates under a new ``Route then Generate'' paradigm to create
data tailored to each student model, enabling it to learn more effectively.
Specifically, PerSyn first assigns each prompt to its optimal teacher via a
query-level router that jointly considers student learnability and teacher
response quality. Each teacher then synthesizes data only for its assigned
prompts, making the process more efficient than the conventional ``Generate
then Select'' paradigm, where all teachers must generate parallel responses for
the entire prompt set before constructing the final dataset. Extensive
experiments across different model families and scales demonstrate that PerSyn
consistently achieves superior or comparable performance to all baselines in
instruct tuning and math reasoning settings. Further analysis verifies the
effectiveness of PerSyn and offers extra insights to propel future research.

*Qizhou Peng,Yang Zheng,Yu Wen,Yanna Wu,Yingying Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel adversarial policy learning method for deep reinforcement learning in multi-party open systems, which does not require direct interaction with victim agents or full environment control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional adversarial attacks in deep reinforcement learning rely on direct manipulation of environments or interactions with victim agents, which are impractical in multi-party open systems.

Method: The authors introduced a neutral agent-based adversarial attack approach that indirectly affects well-trained victim agents through the shared environment rather than direct interactions.

Result: The proposed method was tested on the SMAC platform (Starcraft II) and the Highway-env platform, demonstrating its effectiveness in launching general adversarial attacks in multi-party open systems.

Conclusion: This research expands the potential of adversarial attacks in deep reinforcement learning by overcoming the limitations of existing methods in multi-party environments through the use of neutral-agent-based approaches.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been an important machine learning paradigm
for solving long-horizon sequential decision-making problems under uncertainty.
By integrating deep neural networks (DNNs) into the RL framework, deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged, which achieved significant success in
various domains. However, the integration of DNNs also makes it vulnerable to
adversarial attacks. Existing adversarial attack techniques mainly focus on
either directly manipulating the environment with which a victim agent
interacts or deploying an adversarial agent that interacts with the victim
agent to induce abnormal behaviors. While these techniques achieve promising
results, their adoption in multi-party open systems remains limited due to two
major reasons: impractical assumption of full control over the environment and
dependent on interactions with victim agents.
  To enable adversarial attacks in multi-party open systems, in this paper, we
redesigned an adversarial policy learning approach that can mislead
well-trained victim agents without requiring direct interactions with these
agents or full control over their environments. Particularly, we propose a
neutral agent-based approach across various task scenarios in multi-party open
systems. While the neutral agents seemingly are detached from the victim
agents, indirectly influence them through the shared environment. We evaluate
our proposed method on the SMAC platform based on Starcraft II and the
autonomous driving simulation platform Highway-env. The experimental results
demonstrate that our method can launch general and effective adversarial
attacks in multi-party open systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a predictive framework for cognitive performance based on social determinants of health (SDOH), utilizing the Mex-Cog dataset from the MHAS study, with high accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable early detection of Alzheimer's disease by identifying individuals at high risk based on social and health determinants, promoting timely interventions and equity.

Method: The study used singular value decomposition (SVD)-based imputation for handling missing data and employed XGBoost for predictive modeling due to its high performance. SHAP analysis was applied for feature interpretation.

Result: The framework surpassed existing methods and the data challenge leaderboard, achieving high accuracy and robustness. Flooring material and other SDOH factors were identified as significant predictors of cognitive performance.

Conclusion: The research highlights the role of SDOH in predicting cognitive performance and provides an interpretable, data-driven model for identifying risk factors related to Alzheimer's disease early.

Abstract: Early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial because its
neurodegenerative effects are irreversible, and neuropathologic and
social-behavioral risk factors accumulate years before diagnosis. Identifying
higher-risk individuals earlier enables prevention, timely care, and equitable
resource allocation. We predict cognitive performance from social determinants
of health (SDOH) using the NIH NIA-supported PREPARE Challenge Phase 2 dataset
derived from the nationally representative Mex-Cog cohort of the 2003 and 2012
Mexican Health and Aging Study (MHAS).
  Data: The target is a validated composite cognitive score across seven
domains-orientation, memory, attention, language, constructional praxis, and
executive function-derived from the 2016 and 2021 MHAS waves. Predictors span
demographic, socioeconomic, health, lifestyle, psychosocial, and healthcare
access factors.
  Methodology: Missingness was addressed with a singular value decomposition
(SVD)-based imputation pipeline treating continuous and categorical variables
separately. This approach leverages latent feature correlations to recover
missing values while balancing reliability and scalability. After evaluating
multiple methods, XGBoost was chosen for its superior predictive performance.
  Results and Discussion: The framework outperformed existing methods and the
data challenge leaderboard, demonstrating high accuracy, robustness, and
interpretability. SHAP-based post hoc analysis identified top contributing SDOH
factors and age-specific feature patterns. Notably, flooring material emerged
as a strong predictor, reflecting socioeconomic and environmental disparities.
Other influential factors, age, SES, lifestyle, social interaction, sleep,
stress, and BMI, underscore the multifactorial nature of cognitive aging and
the value of interpretable, data-driven SDOH modeling.

*Wei Huang,Yue Liao,Yukang Chen,Jianhui Liu,Haoru Tan,Si Liu,Shiming Zhang,Shuicheng Yan,Xiaojuan Qi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces MC#, a framework that compresses Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models using static quantization and dynamic pruning while minimizing accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the computational and memory overhead in MoE models due to full expert preloading and activation, aiming to reduce model size and inference cost without significant performance degradation.

Method: The method includes Pre-Loading Mixed-Precision Quantization (PMQ) for optimal bit allocation and Online Top-any Pruning (OTP) for dynamic expert selection, combining static and dynamic optimizations for efficient compression.

Result: MC# achieves 6.2x weight reduction at 2.57 bits with a minor 1.7% accuracy loss in multimodal benchmarks. OTP reduces expert activation by 20% with less than 1% performance degradation.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates strong potential for efficient deployment of MoE-based models by achieving extreme compression while maintaining high performance.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) effectively scales large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs) by increasing capacity through sparse activation.
However, preloading all experts into memory and activating multiple experts per
input introduces significant computational and memory overhead, making the
expert module a major contributor to model size and inference cost. To address
this, we propose MC# (Mixture-Compressor-sharp), a framework that combines
static quantization and dynamic expert pruning by leveraging the significance
of experts and tokens for aggressive compression of MoE-LLMs/VLMs. To reduce
storage and loading costs, we introduce Pre-Loading Mixed-Precision
Quantization (PMQ), which optimizes bit allocation via linear programming,
balancing expert importance and quantization error for a Pareto-optimal
trade-off between size and performance. To reduce runtime computation, Online
Top-any Pruning (OTP) uses Gumbel-Softmax sampling to dynamically select a
subset of experts per token, enabling fine-grained control over activation. By
combining PMQ's static bit-width optimization with OTP's dynamic routing, MC#
achieves extreme compression with minimal accuracy loss. On DeepSeek-VL2, MC#
achieves a 6.2 times weight reduction at 2.57 average bits with only a 1.7%
accuracy drop across five multimodal benchmarks. Additionally, OTP reduces
expert activation over 20% with less than 1% performance degradation,
demonstrating strong potential for efficient MoE-based model deployment.

*Zhuo Li,Yuege Feng,Dandan Guo,Jinpeng Hu,Anningzhe Gao,Xiang Wan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an improvement to Bradley-Terry reward models for aligning large language models with human preferences by introducing an adaptive margin mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional BT-based reward models struggle to distinguish between similar preferences, overfit easier samples, and perform poorly on out-of-distribution examples.

Method: The authors introduced an adaptive margin mechanism using semantic similarity and reward differences, solved through Optimal Transport, to enhance the reward model's ability to focus on challenging samples.

Result: The adaptive margin mechanism improved performance, convergence speed, and generalization capabilities across benchmarks, proving effective in in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances reward models to better align language models with human preferences and demonstrates practical superiority in reinforcement learning through human feedback experiments.

Abstract: The reward model (RM) plays a crucial role in aligning Large Language Models
(LLMs) with human preferences through Reinforcement Learning, where the
Bradley-Terry (BT) objective has been recognized as simple yet powerful,
specifically for pairwise preference learning. However, BT-based RMs often
struggle to effectively distinguish between similar preference responses,
leading to insufficient separation between preferred and non-preferred outputs.
Consequently, they may easily overfit easy samples and cannot generalize well
to Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) samples, resulting in suboptimal performance. To
address these challenges, this paper introduces an effective enhancement to
BT-based RMs through an adaptive margin mechanism. Specifically, we design to
dynamically adjust the RM focus on more challenging samples through margins,
based on both semantic similarity and model-predicted reward differences, which
is approached from a distributional perspective solvable with Optimal Transport
(OT). By incorporating these factors into a principled OT cost matrix design,
our adaptive margin enables the RM to better capture distributional differences
between chosen and rejected responses, yielding significant improvements in

### [646] [Not All Bits Are Equal: Scale-Dependent Memory Optimization Strategies for Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10964)
*Junhyuck Kim,Ethan Ewer,Taehong Moon,Jongho Park,Dimitris Papailiopoulos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores memory optimization in reasoning models under scale-dependent conditions, revealing that the optimization strategies differ between smaller and larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the discrepancy in memory optimization strategies between reasoning and non-reasoning models, focusing particularly on how scale affects memory usage and accuracy.

Method: Systematic experiments conducted over 1,700 inference scenarios using AIME25 and GPQA-Diamond benchmarks to analyze memory trade-offs and scale-dependent strategies.

Result: Models under 8-bit 4B parameters perform better prioritizing weight capacity, while larger models gain accuracy by optimizing for longer generation. The findings also highlight KV cache eviction and parallel scaling thresholds.

Conclusion: Memory optimization strategies are inherently scale-dependent for reasoning models, requiring distinct approaches compared to non-reasoning models.

Abstract: While 4-bit quantization has emerged as a memory-optimal choice for
non-reasoning models and zero-shot tasks across scales, we show that this
universal prescription fails for reasoning models, where the KV cache rather
than model size can dominate memory. Through systematic experiments across
1,700 inference scenarios on AIME25 and GPQA-Diamond, we find a scale-dependent
trade-off: models with an effective size below 8-bit 4B parameters achieve
better accuracy by allocating memory to more weights rather than longer
generation, while larger models achieve better accuracy by allocating memory to
longer generations. This scale threshold also determines when parallel scaling
becomes memory-efficient and whether KV cache eviction outperforms KV
quantization. Our findings show that memory optimization for LLMs cannot be
scale-agnostic, while providing principled guidelines: for small reasoning
models, prioritize model capacity over test-time compute, while for larger
ones, maximize test-time compute. Our results suggest that optimizing reasoning
models for deployment requires fundamentally different strategies from those
established for non-reasoning models.

*Zihan Wang,Zhiyong Ma,Zhongkui Ma,Shuofeng Liu,Akide Liu,Derui Wang,Minhui Xue,Guangdong Bai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces non-transferable examples (NEs) as a method to ensure data utility for authorized AI models while hindering unauthorized uses, without requiring retraining or data perturbation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the increasing demand for data that balances utility for innovation and protection against misuse, particularly in regulated AI environments.

Method: The proposed method recodes input data into model-specific low-sensitivity subspaces, ensuring utility for authorized models while degrading performance for unauthorized ones. The approach relies on subspace misalignment and quantifies effects using mathematical guarantees like the Hoffman-Wielandt inequality.

Result: Experimental results show that NEs retain performance across diverse authorized models and vision-language pipelines, while unauthorized models experience significant degradation even with reconstruction attempts.

Conclusion: Non-transferable examples are presented as an effective and practical solution for safeguarding data utility for authorized AI systems while protecting it from misuse by unauthorized models.

Abstract: Recent AI regulations call for data that remain useful for innovation while
resistant to misuse, balancing utility with protection at the model level.
Existing approaches either perturb data to make it unlearnable or retrain
models to suppress transfer, but neither governs inference by unknown models,
and both typically require control over training. We propose non-transferable
examples (NEs), a training-free and data-agnostic input-side usage-control
mechanism. We recode inputs within a model-specific low-sensitivity subspace,
preserving outputs for the authorized model while reducing performance on
unauthorized models through subspace misalignment. We establish formal bounds
that guarantee utility for the authorized model and quantify deviation for
unauthorized ones, with the Hoffman-Wielandt inequality linking degradation to
spectral differences. Empirically, NEs retain performance on diverse vision
backbones and state-of-the-art vision-language models under common
preprocessing, whereas non-target models collapse even with reconstruction
attempts. These results establish NEs as a practical means to preserve intended
data utility while preventing unauthorized exploitation. Our project is

TL;DR: InstructUE leverages large language models and introduces novel techniques like multi-encoder architecture and contrastive-autoregressive training to improve user representation across domains by being more instruction-aware and resilient to noisy data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing user representation methods lack generalizability across domains and are sensitive to noisy behavioral signals.

Method: The model employs a multi-encoder architecture with lightweight adapters for processing data from diverse sources and a contrastive-autoregressive training framework that uses curated datasets to align user-text embeddings while capturing domain knowledge.

Result: InstructUE outperformed existing methods in real-world tasks such as user prediction, marketing, and recommendations across multiple domains.

Conclusion: Instruction-aware user modeling enhances noise resilience and generalizability, making it effective for robust user representation learning and domain-specific denoising.

Abstract: User representation modeling has become increasingly crucial for personalized
applications, yet existing approaches struggle with generalizability across
domains and sensitivity to noisy behavioral signals. We present InstructUE, an
instruction-aware user embedding foundation model that leverages large language
models (LLMs) to generate general and instruction-aware user representations.
InstructUE introduces a multi-encoder architecture with a lightweight adapter
that efficiently processes heterogeneous data from six different sources while
preserving their structural characteristics. Additionally, it proposes a novel
contrastive-autoregressive training framework that bridges language and
representation spaces through a curated UserQA dataset. The
contrastive-autoregressive training framework simultaneously leverages
autoregressive learning to capture domain knowledge in language space and
contrastive learning to align user-text embeddings in representation space,
thereby enhancing the instruction-awareness and noise-robustness of user
embeddings. Through extensive experiments on real-world applications, we
demonstrate that InstructUE significantly outperforms existing methods across
multiple domains including user prediction, marketing, and recommendation
scenarios. Our results show that instruction-aware user modeling can
effectively achieve instruction-guided denoising of user information in
specific scenarios, paving the way for more generalizable and robust user
representation learning.

### [649] [The Easy Path to Robustness: Coreset Selection using Sample Hardness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11018)
*Pranav Ramesh,Arjun Roy,Deepak Ravikumar,Kaushik Roy,Gopalakrishnan Srinivasan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces EasyCore, a coreset selection algorithm that enhances adversarial robustness by focusing on training with 'easy' samples with low average input gradient norm (AIGN).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current coreset selection methods focus on clean accuracy but do not adequately preserve adversarial robustness, motivating the need for a data-centric approach to build robust models.

Method: The method defines sample 'hardness' through the average input gradient norm (AIGN), identifies 'easy' samples with low AIGN, and trains models using these select samples via a new algorithm named EasyCore.

Result: Models trained on EasyCore-selected data outperform alternatives, achieving up to a 7% increase in adversarial accuracy under standard training and a 5% improvement under TRADES adversarial training.

Conclusion: EasyCore is a model-agnostic and efficient coreset selection algorithm that improves adversarial robustness, making it widely applicable for robust model design.

Abstract: Designing adversarially robust models from a data-centric perspective
requires understanding which input samples are most crucial for learning
resilient features. While coreset selection provides a mechanism for efficient
training on data subsets, current algorithms are designed for clean accuracy
and fall short in preserving robustness. To address this, we propose a
framework linking a sample's adversarial vulnerability to its
\textit{hardness}, which we quantify using the average input gradient norm
(AIGN) over training. We demonstrate that \textit{easy} samples (with low AIGN)
are less vulnerable and occupy regions further from the decision boundary.
Leveraging this insight, we present EasyCore, a coreset selection algorithm
that retains only the samples with low AIGN for training. We empirically show
that models trained on EasyCore-selected data achieve significantly higher
adversarial accuracy than those trained with competing coreset methods under
both standard and adversarial training. As AIGN is a model-agnostic dataset
property, EasyCore is an efficient and widely applicable data-centric method
for improving adversarial robustness. We show that EasyCore achieves up to 7\%
and 5\% improvement in adversarial accuracy under standard training and TRADES
adversarial training, respectively, compared to existing coreset methods.

*Sonakshi Dua,Gonzalo Mateos,Sundeep Prabhakar Chepuri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel uncertainty quantification framework for graph time series that leverages graph structures to ensure accurate predictive outcomes with smaller prediction regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need for reliable decision-making in dynamic networked systems, where current methods fail to adequately address both graph structure and temporal dynamics for uncertainty quantification.

Method: It introduces a conformal prediction-based sequential prediction framework that incorporates graph structures to capture pairwise node dependencies and ensures coverage guarantees.

Result: The proposed method achieves substantial reductions in prediction region size (up to 80%) while maintaining desired empirical coverage, as demonstrated on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The framework improves uncertainty quantification for graph time series, enabling more efficient and accurate predictions in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Trustworthy decision making in networked, dynamic environments calls for
innovative uncertainty quantification substrates in predictive models for graph
time series. Existing conformal prediction (CP) methods have been applied
separately to multivariate time series and static graphs, but they either
ignore the underlying graph topology or neglect temporal dynamics. To bridge
this gap, here we develop a CP-based sequential prediction region framework
tailored for graph time series. A key technical innovation is to leverage the
graph structure and thus capture pairwise dependencies across nodes, while
providing user-specified coverage guarantees on the predictive outcomes. We
formally establish that our scheme yields an exponential shrinkage in the
volume of the ellipsoidal prediction set relative to its graph-agnostic
counterpart. Using real-world datasets, we demonstrate that the novel
uncertainty quantification framework maintains desired empirical coverage while
achieving markedly smaller (up to 80% reduction) prediction regions than
existing approaches.

*Youngrok Park,Hojung Jung,Sangmin Bae,Se-Young Yun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a mechanism called Temporal Alignment Guidance (TAG) to improve diffusion models' sample fidelity during arbitrary guidance by attracting samples back to the desired manifold.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models encounter sample fidelity issues during arbitrary guidance, as off-manifold deviations accumulate throughout the generation process.

Method: The proposed method uses a time predictor to estimate deviations and implements Temporal Alignment Guidance (TAG) to correct samples back to the desired manifold during each timestep of generation.

Result: TAG consistently improves sample alignment with the desired manifold, leading to significant quality enhancements in various downstream tasks.

Conclusion: Temporal Alignment Guidance effectively addresses off-manifold phenomena in diffusion models, enhancing generation quality.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success as generative models.
However, even a well-trained model can accumulate errors throughout the
generation process. These errors become particularly problematic when arbitrary
guidance is applied to steer samples toward desired properties, which often
breaks sample fidelity. In this paper, we propose a general solution to address
the off-manifold phenomenon observed in diffusion models. Our approach
leverages a time predictor to estimate deviations from the desired data
manifold at each timestep, identifying that a larger time gap is associated
with reduced generation quality. We then design a novel guidance mechanism,
`Temporal Alignment Guidance' (TAG), attracting the samples back to the desired
manifold at every timestep during generation. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate that TAG consistently produces samples closely aligned with the
desired manifold at each timestep, leading to significant improvements in
generation quality across various downstream tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes DPNet, a deep learning-based framework for denoising PPG signals, effectively handling noise and maintaining heart rate accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PPG signals are prone to noise and motion artifacts, limiting their effectiveness in wearable health monitoring and heart rate estimation. This creates a need for robust denoising methods.

Method: The study introduces DPNet, a Mamba-based deep learning model, using SI-SDR loss for waveform preservation and auxiliary HR supervision to ensure physiological consistency. Performance was tested on synthetic and real-world noise.

Result: The method outperforms conventional filtering and other neural models, showing strong robustness against noise and motion artifacts, and achieves accurate PPG restoration and heart rate estimation.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate that the proposed method is suitable for practical use in wearable healthcare systems, combining effective denoising with physiological consistency.

Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) is widely used in wearable health monitoring, but
its reliability is often degraded by noise and motion artifacts, limiting
downstream applications such as heart rate (HR) estimation. This paper presents
a deep learning framework for PPG denoising with an emphasis on preserving
physiological information. In this framework, we propose DPNet, a Mamba-based
denoising backbone designed for effective temporal modeling. To further enhance
denoising performance, the framework also incorporates a scale-invariant
signal-to-distortion ratio (SI-SDR) loss to promote waveform fidelity and an
auxiliary HR predictor (HRP) that provides physiological consistency through
HR-based supervision. Experiments on the BIDMC dataset show that our method
achieves strong robustness against both synthetic noise and real-world motion
artifacts, outperforming conventional filtering and existing neural models. Our
method can effectively restore PPG signals while maintaining HR accuracy,
highlighting the complementary roles of SI-SDR loss and HR-guided supervision.
These results demonstrate the potential of our approach for practical
deployment in wearable healthcare systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes AT-GRPO, a specialized reinforcement learning algorithm and system for multi-agent systems (MAS), achieving significant performance gains across various tasks such as planning, coding, and math.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges of applying on-policy reinforcement learning to multi-agent systems (MAS), where standard RL assumptions break down due to varying role-based prompts and turn-wise interactions.

Method: AT-GRPO involves (i) a novel grouped RL algorithm tailored to agent and turn-specific settings in MAS, and (ii) a robust training system enabling both single-policy and multi-policy updates.

Result: AT-GRPO demonstrated substantial improvements in task performance, including raising long-horizon planning accuracy to 96-99.5%, boosting coding task reasoning by 3.87-7.62%, and math task accuracy by 9.0-17.93%.

Conclusion: AT-GRPO effectively overcomes MAS-specific challenges in reinforcement learning, showcasing its ability to substantially enhance task performance across various domains. It provides a promising direction for further research in MAS and RL integration.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) and reinforcement learning (RL) are widely used to
enhance the agentic capabilities of large language models (LLMs). MAS improves
task performance through role-based orchestration, while RL uses environmental
rewards to learn stronger policies, such as GRPO-style optimization. However,
applying on-policy RL to MAS remains underexplored and presents unique
challenges. Algorithmically, standard GRPO grouping assumptions break down
because prompts vary by role and by turn. System-wise, the training stack must
support MAS-workflow rollouts and on-policy updates for both single-policy and
multi-policy models.
  We propose AT-GRPO, which includes (i) an agent- and turn-wise grouped RL
algorithm tailored to MAS and (ii) a training system that supports both single-
and multi-policy regimes. Across game, planning, coding, and math tasks,
AT-GRPO delivers substantial gains. On long-horizon planning, it increases
accuracy from a 14.0 to 47.0 percent single-agent RL baseline to 96.0 to 99.5
percent. It also improves reasoning performance, with average gains of 3.87 to
7.62 percent on coding tasks and 9.0 to 17.93 percent on math. Code and

TL;DR: The paper introduces TED, a single-instance test-time adaptation (TTA) method specifically designed for edge devices using a forward-only approach, achieving high efficiency and adaptability without backpropagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the inefficiencies of existing TTA methods for edge devices, which suffer from high computational demands and unsuitability for resource-constrained scenarios.

Method: Proposes TED, which utilizes forward-only coordinate optimization in the latent principal subspace through the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES), enabling efficient adaptation without backpropagation.

Result: Experiments demonstrated that TED outperformed existing methods on ImageNet and Google Speech Commands datasets, reducing computational complexity by up to 63 times and proving deployment feasibility on the ZYNQ-7020 platform.

Conclusion: TED offers a scalable, efficient, and deployment-ready solution for adapting machine learning models on resource-constrained edge devices with minimal overhead.

Abstract: Edge devices face significant challenges due to limited computational
resources and distribution shifts, making efficient and adaptable machine
learning essential. Existing test-time adaptation (TTA) methods often rely on
gradient-based optimization or batch processing, which are inherently
unsuitable for resource-constrained edge scenarios due to their reliance on
backpropagation and high computational demands. Gradient-free alternatives
address these issues but often suffer from limited learning capacity, lack
flexibility, or impose architectural constraints. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a novel single-instance TTA method tailored for edge
devices (TED), which employs forward-only coordinate optimization in the
principal subspace of latent using the covariance matrix adaptation evolution
strategy (CMA-ES). By updating a compact low-dimensional vector, TED not only
enhances output confidence but also aligns the latent representation closer to
the source latent distribution within the latent principal subspace. This is
achieved without backpropagation, keeping the model parameters frozen, and
enabling efficient, forgetting-free adaptation with minimal memory and
computational overhead. Experiments on image classification and keyword
spotting tasks across the ImageNet and Google Speech Commands series datasets
demonstrate that TED achieves state-of-the-art performance while
$\textit{reducing computational complexity by up to 63 times}$, offering a
practical and scalable solution for real-world edge applications. Furthermore,
we successfully $\textit{deployed TED on the ZYNQ-7020 platform}$,
demonstrating its feasibility and effectiveness for resource-constrained edge
devices in real-world deployments.

*Wonah Kim,Jeonghyeon Park,Dongsan Jun,Jungkyu Han,Sejin Chun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach, CDRL4AD, for anomaly detection in multivariate time series by disentangling causal relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate detection of anomalies in multivariate time series is challenging due to the dynamic, complex causal interactions among variables over time.

Method: The proposed CDRL4AD models causal processes as temporal heterogeneous graphs, identifies causal relationships across time spans, and disentangles latent variables to infer these causal factors.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets show that CDRL4AD outperforms existing methods in both anomaly detection accuracy and root cause analysis.

Conclusion: CDRL4AD offers a robust methodology for identifying and diagnosing anomalies, proving useful for both performance metrics and human diagnostic support.

Abstract: Disentangling complex causal relationships is important for accurate
detection of anomalies. In multivariate time series analysis, dynamic
interactions among data variables over time complicate the interpretation of
causal relationships. Traditional approaches assume statistical independence
between variables in unsupervised settings, whereas recent methods capture
feature correlations through graph representation learning. However, their
representations fail to explicitly infer the causal relationships over
different time periods. To solve the problem, we propose Causally Disentangled
Representation Learning for Anomaly Detection (CDRL4AD) to detect anomalies and
identify their causal relationships in multivariate time series. First, we
design the causal process as model input, the temporal heterogeneous graph, and
causal relationships. Second, our representation identifies causal
relationships over different time periods and disentangles latent variables to
infer the corresponding causal factors. Third, our experiments on real-world
datasets demonstrate that CDRL4AD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms
of accuracy and root cause analysis. Fourth, our model analysis validates
hyperparameter sensitivity and the time complexity of CDRL4AD. Last, we conduct
a case study to show how our approach assists human experts in diagnosing the
root causes of anomalies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces PhysioME, a framework to handle missing or corrupted physiological signal modalities effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of performance degradation in physiological signal-based applications due to missing or corrupted modalities.

Method: PhysioME combines self-supervised learning with contrastive learning and masked prediction, uses a Dual-PathNeuroNet backbone, and includes a restoration decoder for handling incomplete inputs.

Result: Experiments showed PhysioME ensures high consistency and generalization with missing modality data.

Conclusion: PhysioME is a reliable tool for clinical decision-making even with imperfect physiological signal data.

Abstract: Missing or corrupted modalities are common in physiological signal-based
medical applications owing to hardware constraints or motion artifacts.
However, most existing methods assume the availability of all modalities,
resulting in substantial performance degradation in the absence of any
modality. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes PhysioME, a robust
framework designed to ensure reliable performance under missing modality
conditions. PhysioME adopts: (1) a multimodal self-supervised learning approach
that combines contrastive learning with masked prediction; (2) a
Dual-PathNeuroNet backbone tailored to capture the temporal dynamics of each
physiological signal modality; and (3) a restoration decoder that reconstructs
missing modality tokens, enabling flexible processing of incomplete inputs. The
experimental results show that PhysioME achieves high consistency and
generalization performance across various missing modality scenarios. These
findings highlight the potential of PhysioME as a reliable tool for supporting
clinical decision-making in real-world settings with imperfect data
availability.

*Rongjie Zhu,Cong Zhang,Zhiguang Cao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This work demonstrates how a small, fine-tuned LLM can outperform expert-designed components for VRPs, challenging the reliance on massive general-purpose models like GPT-4.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the over-reliance on large, general-purpose LLMs for heuristic generation in VRPs and proposes a smaller, more specialized approach.

Method: The RFTHGS framework fine-tunes a small LLM using reinforcement learning on a curriculum-based reward function to produce superior crossover operators for the HGS solver designed for CVRP.

Result: The fine-tuned LLM generates high-performance, diverse crossover operators that outperform expert designs and commercially available LLMs across various VRP scales.

Conclusion: Smaller, specialized LLMs can effectively replace massive general-purpose models, achieving superior problem-solving capabilities with targeted fine-tuning.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automated
heuristic designers for vehicle routing problems (VRPs), current
state-of-the-art methods predominantly rely on prompting massive,
general-purpose models like GPT-4. This work challenges that paradigm by
demonstrating that a smaller, specialized LLM, when meticulously fine-tuned,
can generate components that surpass expert-crafted heuristics within advanced
solvers. We propose RFTHGS, a novel Reinforcement learning (RL) framework for
Fine-Tuning a small LLM to generate high-performance crossover operators for
the Hybrid Genetic Search (HGS) solver, applied to the Capacitated VRP (CVRP).
Our method employs a multi-tiered, curriculum-based reward function that
progressively guides the LLM to master generating first compilable, then
executable, and finally, superior-performing operators that exceed human expert
designs. This is coupled with an operator caching mechanism that discourages
plagiarism and promotes diversity during training. Comprehensive experiments
show that our fine-tuned LLM produces crossover operators which significantly
outperform the expert-designed ones in HGS. The performance advantage remains
consistent, generalizing from small-scale instances to large-scale problems
with up to 1000 nodes. Furthermore, RFTHGS exceeds the performance of leading
neuro-combinatorial baselines, prompt-based methods, and commercial LLMs such
as GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Multi-Level Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation (MLCM-KD), a framework enhancing thermal facial landmark detection in challenging lighting conditions, achieving state-of-the-art results with reduced computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve facial landmark detection in thermal images, which struggles with limited visual cues and is hindered by high computational costs or structural artifacts in traditional cross-modal solutions.

Method: The proposed MLCM-KD framework decouples RGB-to-thermal knowledge transfer from model compression and introduces Dual-Injected Knowledge Distillation (DIKD), a bidirectional mechanism ensuring semantic consistency and robust knowledge transfer between RGB and thermal modalities.

Result: The authors demonstrate that their approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on public thermal FLD benchmarks, surpassing previous methods and significantly reducing computational demands.

Conclusion: MLCM-KD effectively enhances thermal facial landmark detection by enforcing modality-invariant, semantically aligned feature learning, and achieving better performance with improved efficiency compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Facial Landmark Detection (FLD) in thermal imagery is critical for
applications in challenging lighting conditions, but it is hampered by the lack
of rich visual cues. Conventional cross-modal solutions, like feature fusion or
image translation from RGB data, are often computationally expensive or
introduce structural artifacts, limiting their practical deployment. To address
this, we propose Multi-Level Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation (MLCM-KD), a
novel framework that decouples high-fidelity RGB-to-thermal knowledge transfer
from model compression to create both accurate and efficient thermal FLD
models. A central challenge during knowledge transfer is the profound modality
gap between RGB and thermal data, where traditional unidirectional distillation
fails to enforce semantic consistency across disparate feature spaces. To
overcome this, we introduce Dual-Injected Knowledge Distillation (DIKD), a
bidirectional mechanism designed specifically for this task. DIKD establishes a
connection between modalities: it not only guides the thermal student with rich
RGB features but also validates the student's learned representations by
feeding them back into the frozen teacher's prediction head. This closed-loop
supervision forces the student to learn modality-invariant features that are
semantically aligned with the teacher, ensuring a robust and profound knowledge
transfer. Experiments show that our approach sets a new state-of-the-art on
public thermal FLD benchmarks, notably outperforming previous methods while
drastically reducing computational overhead.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Test-time Adaptation by Causal Trimming (TACT), a method that improves model robustness under distribution shifts by removing non-causal components from representations at test time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address performance degradation caused by models relying on non-causal features during distribution shifts.

Method: TACT leverages data augmentations with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify and remove high-variance directions associated with non-causal features from representations.

Result: TACT demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in empirical tests on real-world out-of-distribution benchmarks.

Conclusion: TACT provides an effective approach for test-time adaptation by refining representations to focus on causal features, enhancing model robustness under distribution shifts.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation aims to improve model robustness under distribution
shifts by adapting models with access to unlabeled target samples. A primary
cause of performance degradation under such shifts is the model's reliance on
features that lack a direct causal relationship with the prediction target. We
introduce Test-time Adaptation by Causal Trimming (TACT), a method that
identifies and removes non-causal components from representations for test
distributions. TACT applies data augmentations that preserve causal features
while varying non-causal ones. By analyzing the changes in the representations
using Principal Component Analysis, TACT identifies the highest variance
directions associated with non-causal features. It trims the representations by
removing their projections on the identified directions, and uses the trimmed
representations for the predictions. During adaptation, TACT continuously
tracks and refines these directions to get a better estimate of non-causal
features. We theoretically analyze the effectiveness of this approach and
empirically validate TACT on real-world out-of-distribution benchmarks. TACT
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin.

*Zhijian Zhou,Xunye Tian,Liuhua Peng,Chao Lei,Antonin Schrab,Danica J. Sutherland,Feng Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new method for kernel-based two-sample and independence testing by explicitly incorporating kernel diversity to improve test power while controlling Type-I error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve testing power and address limitations caused by highly similar kernels in kernel-based two-sample and independence tests.

Method: The paper introduces an aggregated statistic that considers kernel diversity using covariance, combined with a testing framework that selects effective and diverse kernels based on training phase information.

Result: Theoretical proof shows consistency in test power and Type-I error control, and extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance across various benchmarks.

Conclusion: Incorporating diversity in kernel selection leads to more effective aggregation for two-sample and independence testing without compromising error control.

Abstract: To adapt kernel two-sample and independence testing to complex structured
data, aggregation of multiple kernels is frequently employed to boost testing
power compared to single-kernel tests. However, we observe a phenomenon that
directly maximizing multiple kernel-based statistics may result in highly
similar kernels that capture highly overlapping information, limiting the
effectiveness of aggregation. To address this, we propose an aggregated
statistic that explicitly incorporates kernel diversity based on the covariance
between different kernels. Moreover, we identify a fundamental challenge: a
trade-off between the diversity among kernels and the test power of individual
kernels, i.e., the selected kernels should be both effective and diverse. This
motivates a testing framework with selection inference, which leverages
information from the training phase to select kernels with strong individual
performance from the learned diverse kernel pool. We provide rigorous
theoretical statements and proofs to show the consistency on the test power and
control of Type-I error, along with asymptotic analysis of the proposed
statistics. Lastly, we conducted extensive empirical experiments demonstrating
the superior performance of our proposed approach across various benchmarks for
both two-sample and independence testing.

*Mohammad Karami,Mostafa Jalali,Fatemeh Ghassemi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified anomaly detection framework combining classical and deep learning forecasting methods. It provides a systematic evaluation on diverse datasets, highlighting LSTM's robust performance in complex scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of systematic cross-domain evaluations in time series anomaly detection methods, aiming to unify approaches and establish reliable baselines across domains.

Method: The study integrates preprocessing, four forecasting models (Holt-Winters, SARIMA, LSTM, Informer), four detection methods, and dual evaluation metrics (e.g., MAE, F1-score). A large-scale benchmarking is conducted using Numenta Anomaly Benchmark datasets.

Result: LSTM achieves top performance with an F1 score of 0.688 and high correlation for complex patterns. Informer shows competitive accuracy with faster training. Classical methods work well for simple data but fall short on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that forecasting model quality heavily influences detection success. It provides guidance for model selection based on data complexity and resource constraints, and establishes benchmarks for future research.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is critical for modern digital infrastructures,
yet existing methods lack systematic cross-domain evaluation. We present a
comprehensive forecasting-based framework unifying classical methods
(Holt-Winters, SARIMA) with deep learning architectures (LSTM, Informer) under
a common residual-based detection interface. Our modular pipeline integrates
preprocessing (normalization, STL decomposition), four forecasting models, four
detection methods, and dual evaluation through forecasting metrics (MAE, RMSE,
PCC) and detection metrics (Precision, Recall, F1, AUC). We conduct the first
complete evaluation on the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (58 datasets, 7
categories) with 232 model training runs and 464 detection evaluations
achieving 100\% success rate. LSTM achieves best performance (F1: 0.688,
ranking first or second on 81\% of datasets) with exceptional correlation on
complex patterns (PCC: 0.999). Informer provides competitive accuracy (F1:
0.683) with 30\% faster training. Classical methods achieve perfect predictions
on simple synthetic data with 60 lower cost but show 2-3 worse F1-scores on
real-world datasets. Forecasting quality dominates detection performance:
differences between detection methods (F1: 0.621-0.688) are smaller than
between forecasting models (F1: 0.344-0.688). Our findings provide
evidence-based guidance: use LSTM for complex patterns, Informer for
efficiency-critical deployments, and classical methods for simple periodic data
with resource constraints. The complete implementation and results establish
baselines for future forecasting-based anomaly detection research.

### [662] [ELMO: Efficiency via Low-precision and Peak Memory Optimization in Large Output Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11168)
*Jinbin Zhang,Nasib Ullah,Erik Schultheis,Rohit Babbar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ELMO, a pure low-precision training framework using BFloat16 and Float8 data types, enabling extreme multilabel classification (XMC) models to be trained with significantly reduced memory requirements without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extreme multilabel classification (XMC) involves handling large-scale labeling scenarios where compute and memory requirements become critical due to the massive number of labels exceeding millions. Current methods using mixed-precision training are often unstable, inefficient in memory usage, and computationally taxing, presenting a need for better solutions.

Method: The authors propose using BFloat16 and Float8 data types for pure low-precision training combined with techniques like Kahan summation and stochastic rounding. They enhance memory efficiency through gradient fusion and chunking, eliminating reliance on higher precision elements like master weights or tensor scaling in training models.

Result: The ELMO framework trained a 3-million-label XMC model with only 6.6 GiB of GPU memory, vastly reducing memory usage compared to 39.7 GiB in the previous state-of-the-art method, Renee. Performance accuracy was maintained on par with existing methods.

Conclusion: ELMO demonstrates the viability of purely low-precision techniques for training XMC models, serving as both a memory-efficient and computationally robust alternative to mixed-precision methods often relied upon in the field.

Abstract: Large output spaces, also referred to as Extreme multilabel classification
(XMC), is a setting that arises, e.g., in large-scale tagging and
product-to-product recommendation, and is characterized by the number of labels
ranging from hundreds of thousands to millions. This means that the linear
classification head, usually only a tiny fraction of the overall model, turns
into the main driver for compute and memory demand. Current state-of-the-art
XMC methods predominantly rely on FP16-FP32 mixed-precision training, which we
show can be unstable, and inefficient in terms of memory usage and
computational overhead. Meanwhile, existing low-precision methods typically
retain higher precision for the classification layer. In this work, we propose
ELMO, a pure low-precision training framework for XMC models using BFloat16 and
Float8 data types. By leveraging Kahan summation and stochastic rounding, we
demonstrate that XMC models can be effectively trained entirely in Float8,
without relying on single-precision master weights or tensor scaling.
Low-precision training, combined with our proposed memory optimizations --
gradient fusion and chunking -- enables significant reductions in GPU memory
usage. For example, we train a 3-million-label XMC model with only 6.6 GiB of
GPU memory, compared to the 39.7 GiB required by the optimized SOTA method,
Renee without compromising accuracy.

*Ilaria Vascotto,Alex Rodriguez,Alessandro Bonaita,Luca Bortolussi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discusses enhancing trust in AI systems by improving the robustness of explanations through aggregated feature importance from multiple models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the trustworthiness and ethical usage of AI in high-risk scenarios by focusing on the robustness of explanations in XAI, often overlooked during AI development.

Method: The method aggregates feature importance using multiple models (k-nearest neighbors, random forest, and neural networks) to analyze and improve explanation robustness.

Result: Preliminary results indicate an increase in application trustworthiness and demonstrate the advantages of leveraging multiple models' predictive power.

Conclusion: Enhancing explanation robustness through multi-model aggregation has the potential to improve trust in AI systems and make them more reliable for high-risk applications.

Abstract: The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models in real-world and high-risk
applications has intensified the discussion about their trustworthiness and
ethical usage, from both a technical and a legislative perspective. The field
of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) addresses this challenge by
proposing explanations that bring to light the decision-making processes of
complex black-box models. Despite being an essential property, the robustness
of explanations is often an overlooked aspect during development: only robust
explanation methods can increase the trust in the system as a whole. This paper
investigates the role of robustness through the usage of a feature importance
aggregation derived from multiple models ($k$-nearest neighbours, random forest
and neural networks). Preliminary results showcase the potential in increasing
the trustworthiness of the application, while leveraging multiple model's
predictive power.

*Daniel Scalena,Leonidas Zotos,Elisabetta Fersini,Malvina Nissim,Ahmet Üstün*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EAGer optimizes compute allocation for reasoning language models by leveraging token-wise uncertainty, improving efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving reasoning language model efficiency by reducing redundant computation during test-time sampling.

Method: A training-free method utilizing token-wise entropy to branch reasoning paths and reallocate computation for complex prompts.

Result: EAGer achieves up to 65% reduction in token generation and 37% improvement in Pass@k compared to Full Parallel Sampling.

Conclusion: EAGer balances efficiency and performance in reasoning tasks by dynamically adjusting compute allocation based on token entropy.

Abstract: With the rise of reasoning language models and test-time scaling methods as a
paradigm for improving model performance, substantial computation is often
required to generate multiple candidate sequences from the same prompt. This
enables exploration of different reasoning paths toward the correct solution,
however, allocates the same compute budget for each prompt. Grounded on the
assumption that different prompts carry different degrees of complexity, and
thus different computation needs, we propose EAGer, a training-free generation
method that leverages model uncertainty through token-wise entropy distribution
to reduce redundant computation and concurrently improve overall performance.
EAGer allows branching to multiple reasoning paths only in the presence of
high-entropy tokens, and then reallocates the saved compute budget to the
instances where exploration of alternative paths is most needed. We find that
across multiple open-source models on complex reasoning benchmarks such as AIME
2025, EAGer can reallocate the budget without accessing target labels,
achieving the best efficiency-performance trade-off in terms of reasoning
length and Pass@k. When target labels are accessible, EAGer generates up to 65%
fewer tokens (hence saving compute) and achieves up to 37% improvement in
Pass@k compared to the Full Parallel Sampling.

### [665] [Can Tool-Integrated Reinforcement Learning Generalize Across Diverse Domains?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11184)
*Zhengyu Chen,Jinluan Yang,Teng Xiao,Ruochen Zhou,Luan Zhang,Xiangyu Xi,Xiaowei Shi,Wei Wang,Jinggang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores cross-domain generalization of a large language model equipped with a code interpreter, trained only on mathematical problem-solving tasks. They propose a framework (TGRL) that enhances domain-agnostic skill transfer and validate its effectiveness with state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether reinforcement learning-based tool usage, trained in a restricted domain (mathematical tasks), can generalize effectively to diverse reasoning domains.

Method: The authors develop a Tool Generalization Reinforcement Learning (TGRL) framework featuring a standardized tool interface, a dual-component reward system, and an XML-based prompt template to promote domain-agnostic learning and reasoning.

Result: The proposed framework demonstrates effective cross-domain skill transfer and achieves state-of-the-art performance, showcasing the versatility of RL-based tool usage in other reasoning-intensive tasks.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of Tool RL for LLM reasoning in diverse domains, emphasizing the importance of designing frameworks that enable domain-invariant learning and efficient skill generalization.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in reasoning and tool utilization. However, the generalization of
tool-augmented reinforcement learning (RL) across diverse domains remains
underexplored. In this work, we investigate the cross-domain generalization of
an LLM agent equipped with a code interpreter tool, which is exclusively
trained on mathematical problem-solving tasks. Despite the restricted training
domain, we evaluate the agent's performance across several distinct reasoning
domains. The results reveal that RL-based tool usage learned from mathematical
tasks can be effectively transferred to complex tasks in other domains,
enabling great task performance and high token efficiency. To facilitate this
cross-domain transfer, we propose a Tool Generalization Reinforcement Learning
(TGRL) framework designed to promote domain-agnostic learning and skill
migration, encompassing: (i) a standardized tool interface that abstracts
domain-specific nuances through consistent formatting and explicit termination,
fostering transferable invocation patterns; (ii) a dual-component reward system
that decomposes rewards to incentivize generalizable behaviors like tool
efficiency and reasoning abstraction, ensuring alignment and robustness across
domain shifts; and (iii) an XML-based prompt template that separates thinking,
tool calls, and responses to encourage modular, domain-invariant planning and
coherent multi-turn interactions. Extensive experiments across diverse
benchmarks validate our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance and
highlighting the cross-domain potential of Tool RL for LLM reasoning.

*Gareth Seneque,Lap-Hang Ho,Nafise Erfanian Saeedi,Jeffrey Molendijk,Ariel Kupermann,Tim Elson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ENIGMA is a new training approach for large-language models that improves reasoning, alignment, and robustness by optimizing information geometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of aligning and improving large-language models' reasoning and robustness while adhering to organizational policies and principles.

Method: ENIGMA combines Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with CoT rewards, a Self-Supervised Alignment with Mutual Information (SAMI) auxiliary, and Sinkhorn optimal-transport regularizer. Metrics like the Sufficiency Index (SI) gauge how principles influence training.

Result: Experiments using 1B parameter LLMs showed steadier training dynamics, improved benchmark performance, and validated desirable changes in the model's information manifold.

Conclusion: ENIGMA enables principled reasoning and alignment in LLMs without relying on reward models, providing a trusted and effective training approach.

Abstract: We present Entropic Mutual-Information Geometry Large-Language Model
Alignment (ENIGMA), a novel approach to Large-Language Model (LLM) training
that jointly improves reasoning, alignment and robustness by treating an
organisation's policies/principles as directions to move on a model's
information manifold. Our single-loop trainer combines Group-Relative Policy
Optimisation (GRPO), an on-policy, critic-free RL method with Chain-of-Thought
(CoT)-format only rewards; a Self-Supervised Alignment with Mutual Information
(SAMI)-style symmetric InfoNCE auxiliary; and an entropic Sinkhorn
optimal-transport regulariser on hidden-state distributions to bound geometry
drift. We also introduce infoNCE metrics that specialise to a standard MI lower
bound under matched negatives to measure how strongly a model's CoT encodes
these policies. These metrics include a Sufficiency Index (SI) that enables the
selection and creation of principles that maximise downstream performance prior
to training. In our experiments using small (1B) LLMs, high-SI principles
predict steadier training dynamics and improved benchmark performance over GRPO
ablations. Our information-geometry analysis of trained models validates
desirable structural change in the manifold. These results support our
hypothesis that reasoning, alignment, and robustness are projections of a
single informationgeometric objective, and that models trained using ENIGMA
demonstrate principled reasoning without the use of a reward model, offering a
path to trusted capability

*Xinhui Chen,Zuchao Li,Mengqi Gao,Yufeng Zhang,Chak Tou Leong,Haoyang Li,Jiaqi Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces the 'Protein-as-Second-Language' framework to analyze protein sequences using large language models (LLMs) through a zero-shot setting, showcasing improved performance over highly specialized models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding unseen protein sequences is a challenge with profound scientific implications, but current methods often require task-specific tuning or large-scale training.

Method: The proposed framework reformulates protein sequences as sentences, allowing LLMs to interpret them using contextual inference in a zero-shot setting. A curated dataset with 79,926 protein-QA instances supports the approach.

Result: Consistent performance gains were observed across various LLMs, with improvements up to 17.2% (average +7% ROUGE-L) over fine-tuned protein-specific models.

Conclusion: Generic LLMs, when guided by protein-specific linguistic cues, can outperform domain-specialized models, presenting a scalable method for protein analysis through foundational AI models.

Abstract: Deciphering the function of unseen protein sequences is a fundamental
challenge with broad scientific impact, yet most existing methods depend on
task-specific adapters or large-scale supervised fine-tuning. We introduce the
"Protein-as-Second-Language" framework, which reformulates amino-acid sequences
as sentences in a novel symbolic language that large language models can
interpret through contextual exemplars. Our approach adaptively constructs
sequence-question-answer triples that reveal functional cues in a zero-shot
setting, without any further training. To support this process, we curate a
bilingual corpus of 79,926 protein-QA instances spanning attribute prediction,
descriptive understanding, and extended reasoning. Empirically, our method
delivers consistent gains across diverse open-source LLMs and GPT-4, achieving
up to 17.2% ROUGE-L improvement (average +7%) and even surpassing fine-tuned
protein-specific language models. These results highlight that generic LLMs,
when guided with protein-as-language cues, can outperform domain-specialized
models, offering a scalable pathway for protein understanding in foundation
models.

### [668] [Evaluating Line-level Localization Ability of Learning-based Code Vulnerability Detection Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11202)
*Marco Pintore,Giorgio Piras,Angelo Sotgiu,Maura Pintor,Battista Biggio*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates the tendency of machine learning-based software vulnerability detectors to provide coarse-grained predictions and analyzes their susceptibility to biases using a novel "Detection Alignment" (DA) evaluation method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly used for software vulnerability detection, yet they struggle with precise localization within the input code, which is crucial for developers to properly address vulnerabilities.

Method: The authors propose Detection Alignment (DA), an explainability-driven, model-agnostic evaluation method to quantify the alignment between predictive influence on specific code lines and ground-truth vulnerability locations.

Result: The study demonstrates that many vulnerability detectors exhibit consistent bias, with their predictions unduly influenced by non-vulnerable code lines.

Conclusion: The work highlights the impact of biases and spurious correlations in existing ML-based vulnerability detection tools, underscoring the need for more refined, bias-resilient models.

Abstract: To address the extremely concerning problem of software vulnerability, system
security is often entrusted to Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. Despite their
now established detection capabilities, such models are limited by design to
flagging the entire input source code function as vulnerable, rather than
precisely localizing the concerned code lines. However, the detection
granularity is crucial to support human operators during software development,
ensuring that such predictions reflect the true code semantics to help debug,
evaluate, and fix the detected vulnerabilities. To address this issue, recent
work made progress toward improving the detector's localization ability, thus
narrowing down the vulnerability detection "window" and providing more
fine-grained predictions. Such approaches, however, implicitly disregard the
presence of spurious correlations and biases in the data, which often
predominantly influence the performance of ML algorithms. In this work, we
investigate how detectors comply with this requirement by proposing an
explainability-based evaluation procedure. Our approach, defined as Detection
Alignment (DA), quantifies the agreement between the input source code lines
that most influence the prediction and the actual localization of the
vulnerability as per the ground truth. Through DA, which is model-agnostic and
adaptable to different detection tasks, not limited to our use case, we analyze
multiple learning-based vulnerability detectors and datasets. As a result, we
show how the predictions of such models are consistently biased by
non-vulnerable lines, ultimately highlighting the high impact of biases and
spurious correlations. The code is available at

Motivation: To address limitations in existing reservoir computing models for forecasting complex spatiotemporal datasets, particularly in achieving both high resolution and long-term accuracy.

Method: The researchers designed a multi-layer reservoir computing architecture that incorporates inputs at varying resolutions, enabling better representation of both local and global system dynamics.

Result: The proposed method demonstrated superior performance compared to standard parallel reservoir models in forecasting Sea Surface Temperature data, showcasing better predictive accuracy and dynamic interplay across layers.

Conclusion: The architecture's cross-layer coupling notably improves forecasting accuracy by aligning network dynamics, where higher layers exhibit increasingly linear dynamics and effectively propagate slow modes.

Abstract: We propose a new reservoir computing method for forecasting high-resolution
spatiotemporal datasets. By combining multi-resolution inputs from coarser to
finer layers, our architecture better captures both local and global dynamics.
Applied to Sea Surface Temperature data, it outperforms standard parallel
reservoir models in long-term forecasting, demonstrating the effectiveness of
cross-layers coupling in improving predictive accuracy. Finally, we show that
the optimal network dynamics in each layer become increasingly linear,
revealing the slow modes propagated to subsequent layers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReLook leverages vision-grounded reinforcement learning to improve front-end code generation using a multimodal large language model (MLLM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of large language models in front-end development, where correctness depends on visual rendering and interaction.

Method: The paper introduces ReLook, a reinforcement learning framework utilizing MLLMs. It uses a generate-diagnose-refine loop, visual scoring, and Forced Optimization techniques to train agents in a vision-grounded approach.

Result: ReLook consistently outperformed baselines in benchmarks for vision-grounded front-end code generation by leveraging visual rewards and a lightweight inference cycle.

Conclusion: ReLook demonstrates that integrating visual perception and iterative refinement significantly improves the accuracy and efficiency of front-end code generation.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at algorithmic code generation, they
struggle with front-end development, where correctness is judged on rendered
pixels and interaction. We present ReLook, an agentic, vision-grounded
reinforcement learning framework that empowers an agent to close a robust
generate--diagnose--refine loop by invoking a multimodal LLM (MLLM) as a tool.
During training, the agent uses the MLLM-in-the-loop both as a visual
critic--scoring code with screenshots--and as a source of actionable,
vision-grounded feedback; a strict zero-reward rule for invalid renders anchors
renderability and prevents reward hacking. To prevent behavioral collapse, we
introduce Forced Optimization, a strict acceptance rule that admits only
improving revisions, yielding monotonically better trajectories. At inference,
we decouple the critic and run a lightweight, critic-free self-edit cycle,
keeping latency comparable to base decoding while retaining most of the gains.
Across three widely used benchmarks, ReLook consistently outperforms strong
baselines in vision-grounded front-end code generation, highlighting the
benefits of agentic perception, visual rewards, and training-inference
decoupling.

Motivation: There is a need for Graph Neural Network models that can handle variable output sizes in graph-structured data while satisfying dynamic input-dependent constraints.

Method: ProjNet integrates a sparse vector clipping method with the Component-Averaged Dykstra (CAD) algorithm, introduces a surrogate gradient for CAD to enable end-to-end training, and uses GPU acceleration for efficient handling of large-scale inputs.

Result: ProjNet demonstrates effectiveness across diverse constrained optimization problems, including linear programming, non-convex quadratic programming, and radio transmit power optimization.

Conclusion: ProjNet offers a flexible and computationally efficient framework for solving constrained optimization problems in graph-based machine learning applications.

Abstract: Many machine learning applications require outputs that satisfy complex,
dynamic constraints. This task is particularly challenging in Graph Neural
Network models due to the variable output sizes of graph-structured data. In
this paper, we introduce ProjNet, a Graph Neural Network framework which
satisfies input-dependant constraints. ProjNet combines a sparse vector
clipping method with the Component-Averaged Dykstra (CAD) algorithm, an
iterative scheme for solving the best-approximation problem. We establish a
convergence result for CAD and develop a GPU-accelerated implementation capable
of handling large-scale inputs efficiently. To enable end-to-end training, we
introduce a surrogate gradient for CAD that is both computationally efficient
and better suited for optimization than the exact gradient. We validate ProjNet
on four classes of constrained optimisation problems: linear programming, two
classes of non-convex quadratic programs, and radio transmit power
optimization, demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse problem settings.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Neural Weight Compression (NWC), a learned compression method for language model weights, addressing challenges through novel autoencoder techniques and achieving strong accuracy at lower precisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The storage and transmission of large-scale language model weights is increasingly critical, yet current compression methods rely heavily on manual adjustments due to limited understanding of this data modality.

Method: A learned compression framework using Neural Weight Compression (NWC), an autoencoder-based neural codec, enhanced with techniques such as tensor chunking, importance-aware loss, and error-compensation mechanisms.

Result: Experiments demonstrate NWC achieves state-of-the-art compression-accuracy balance, particularly excelling at 4-6 bit precisions while maintaining accuracy comparable to FP16 models.

Conclusion: NWC represents a significant advancement in language model weight compression, offering effective and efficient techniques with potential broad applications in large-scale machine learning.

Abstract: The efficient storage and transmission of language model weights is becoming
increasingly important, as their scale and adoption continue to grow. However,
as our understanding of this new data modality is limited, designing a good
compression algorithm for language model weights heavily relies on manual,
trial-and-error approaches. In this paper, we propose a learned compression
framework that trains neural codecs directly from pretrained language model
weights. Unlike conventional data (e.g., images), language model weights pose
unique challenges: the sizes and shapes of weight tensors vary significantly,
and the reconstruction quality must be judged by downstream model predictions
rather than na\"ive MSE loss. To address this, we introduce Neural Weight
Compression (NWC), a novel autoencoder-based neural codec tailored to model
weight compression. The proposed method inherits the advantages of
autoencoder-based codecs while incorporating three technical components: (1)
column-wise tensor chunking and normalization; (2) an importance-aware training
loss; (3) an inference-time error compensation mechanism guided by model
outputs. Experiments on open-weight language models show that NWC achieves
competitive or state-of-the-art accuracy-compression tradeoffs, with
particularly strong results at 4-6 bit precisions where accuracy remains nearly
on par with FP16 models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inverse problem of learning connection graphs (CGs), which are vital for tasks like synchronization, signal processing, and diffusion—focusing on global geometric consistency.

Method: A maximum pseudo-likelihood framework is developed under a consistency assumption, and the Structured Connection Graph Learning (SCGL) algorithm is proposed. SCGL uses block-optimization over Riemannian manifolds to infer network topology, edge weights, and geometry.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that SCGL outperforms current methods in recovering network topology and geometric structure, while also maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: SCGL effectively and computationally learns connection graphs from signals with better accuracy and geometric fidelity compared to existing models, advancing applications in related fields.

Abstract: Connection graphs (CGs) extend traditional graph models by coupling network
topology with orthogonal transformations, enabling the representation of global
geometric consistency. They play a key role in applications such as
synchronization, Riemannian signal processing, and neural sheaf diffusion. In
this work, we address the inverse problem of learning CGs directly from
observed signals. We propose a principled framework based on maximum
pseudo-likelihood under a consistency assumption, which enforces spectral
properties linking the connection Laplacian to the underlying combinatorial
Laplacian. Based on this formulation, we introduce the Structured Connection
Graph Learning (SCGL) algorithm, a block-optimization procedure over Riemannian
manifolds that jointly infers network topology, edge weights, and geometric
structure. Our experiments show that SCGL consistently outperforms existing
baselines in both topological recovery and geometric fidelity, while remaining
computationally efficient.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a fast semi-supervised embedding framework for node classification in graphs with limited features, using three optimization objectives to achieve high accuracy at reduced computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graphs often have nodes lacking informative features. Node classification in such scenarios relies heavily on capturing structural roles and topological context through embeddings.

Method: The framework optimizes unsupervised modularity approximation, supervised regularization to reduce intra-class variance, and semi-supervised random-walk-based label propagation with attention-weighted similarity in one iterative scheme.

Result: The approach demonstrates classification accuracy equal to or better than state-of-the-art methods across benchmarks while being computationally efficient.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively produces quality node embeddings, proving its usefulness in classifying nodes in graphs with limited features and highlighting its efficiency advantage.

Abstract: Graph-based learning is a cornerstone for analyzing structured data, with
node classification as a central task. However, in many real-world graphs,
nodes lack informative feature vectors, leaving only neighborhood connectivity
and class labels as available signals. In such cases, effective classification
hinges on learning node embeddings that capture structural roles and
topological context. We introduce a fast semi-supervised embedding framework
that jointly optimizes three complementary objectives: (i) unsupervised
structure preservation via scalable modularity approximation, (ii) supervised
regularization to minimize intra-class variance among labeled nodes, and (iii)
semi-supervised propagation that refines unlabeled nodes through
random-walk-based label spreading with attention-weighted similarity. These
components are unified into a single iterative optimization scheme, yielding
high-quality node embeddings. On standard benchmarks, our method consistently
achieves classification accuracy at par with or superior to state-of-the-art
approaches, while requiring significantly less computational cost.

Result: The proposed approach improves balanced accuracy for predicting cardiovascular death compared to using raw data.

Conclusion: The methodology shows promise for enhancing clinical event prediction, particularly in scenarios with abundant unlabeled data availability.

Abstract: As clinical data are becoming increasingly available, machine learning
methods have been employed to extract knowledge from them and predict clinical
events. While promising, approaches suffer from at least two main issues: low
availability of labelled data and data heterogeneity leading to missing values.
This work proposes the use of self-supervised auto-encoders to efficiently
address these challenges. We apply our methodology to a clinical dataset from
patients with ischaemic heart disease. Patient data is embedded in a latent
space, built using unlabelled data, which is then used to train a neural
network classifier to predict cardiovascular death. Results show improved
balanced accuracy compared to applying the classifier directly to the raw data,
demonstrating that this solution is promising, especially in conditions where
availability of unlabelled data could increase.

### [676] [Boundary-Guided Policy Optimization for Memory-efficient RL of Diffusion Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11683)
*Nianyi Lin,Jiajie Zhang,Lei Hou,Juanzi Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Boundary-Guided Policy Optimization (BGPO), a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm designed to address memory inefficiencies and inaccuracies in training diffusion large language models (dLLMs). BGPO enables efficient and precise optimization, showing superior performance in tasks like math problem solving, code generation, and planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from addressing the challenge of intractable likelihood functions in RL training of dLLMs, where existing methods cause high memory overhead and inaccurate approximations of likelihoods.

Method: The proposed BGPO algorithm creates a linear lower bound of the ELBO-based objective that allows gradient accumulation across large Monte Carlo samples without increasing memory usage, while maintaining equivalence in on-policy training.

Result: BGPO enables the use of larger Monte Carlo sample sizes, leading to more precise likelihood approximations and enhanced performance on RL objectives.

Conclusion: BGPO overcomes key challenges in memory and accuracy, significantly outperforming prior RL methods in applications like math problem solving, code generation, and planning when applied to dLLMs.

Abstract: A key challenge in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to diffusion large
language models (dLLMs) lies in the intractability of their likelihood
functions, which are essential for the RL objective, necessitating
corresponding approximation in each training step. While existing methods
approximate the log-likelihoods by their evidence lower bounds (ELBOs) via
customized Monte Carlo (MC) sampling, the forward computational graphs of all
MC samples need to be retained for the gradient computation of non-linear terms
in the RL objective, resulting in significant memory overhead. This constraint
restricts feasible sample sizes, leading to imprecise likelihood approximations
and ultimately distorting the RL objective. To overcome this limitation, we
propose \emph{Boundary-Guided Policy Optimization} (BGPO), a memory-efficient
RL algorithm that maximizes a specially constructed lower bound of the
ELBO-based objective. This lower bound is carefully designed to satisfy two key
properties: (1) Linearity: it is formulated in a linear sum where each term
depends only on a single MC sample, thereby enabling gradient accumulation
across samples and ensuring constant memory usage; (2) Equivalence: Both the
value and gradient of this lower bound are equal to those of the ELBO-based
objective in on-policy training, making it also an effective approximation for
the original RL objective. These properties allow BGPO to adopt a large MC
sample size, resulting in more accurate likelihood approximations and improved
RL objective estimation, which in turn leads to enhanced performance.
Experiments show that BGPO significantly outperforms previous RL algorithms for
dLLMs in math problem solving, code generation, and planning tasks.

### [677] [FedLoRA-Optimizer: Federated LoRA Fine-Tuning with Global and Local Optimization in Heterogeneous Data Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11274)
*Jianzhe Zhao,Hailin Zhu,Yu Zhang,Ziqi Chen,Guibing Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a fine-grained federated LoRA tuning method to address weaknesses in global model generalization and local model personalization using heterogeneous data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome challenges in federated efficient fine-tuning, specifically addressing client drift, limited personalization in local models, and the lack of fine-grained tuning of LoRA matrices.

Method: The approach involves separate fine-tuning of directional vectors (shared knowledge) in the A matrix and magnitude vectors (personalized knowledge) in the B matrix, combined with a pipeline of global and local optimizers.

Result: Experiments using Databricks-Dolly-15k and Natural Instructions datasets with models like LLaMA2-7B and Deepseek-7B show improvements in global performance by 0.39% and local performance by 0.59%.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances both generalization capabilities of the global model and personalization for local models in federated fine-tuning scenarios under heterogeneous data.

Abstract: Federated efficient fine-tuning has emerged as an approach that leverages
distributed data and computational resources across nodes to address the
challenges of large-scale fine-tuning and privacy preservation. The Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) enables efficient fine-tuning of large-scale pre-trained
models by introducing trainable low-rank matrices into weight updates.However,
in heterogeneous data scenarios, client drift weakens the generalization of the
global model, and local models often fail to meet the personalized needs of
individual clients.Moreover, existing federated LoRA efficient fine-tuning
techniques overlook fine-grained analysis of the tuning matrices. To address
this, we conducted preliminary experiments and found that different LoRA
matrices exhibit different sensitivity to changes in the direction and
magnitude of their vectors.We thus propose a fine-grained federated LoRA tuning
method. By fine-tuning the more sensitive directional vectors in the A matrix,
which encode shared knowledge, our method learns shared features more
effectively across clients and enhances global generalization. Simultaneously,
by fine-tuning the more sensitive magnitude vectors in the B matrix, which
encode personalized knowledge, our method better captures personalized
knowledge, enabling detailed adaptation to local data. The method uses a
pipeline combining global and local optimizers. Global optimization further
improves local models, achieving collaborative optimization between global and
local levels. This improves both the generalization ability of the global model
and the personalized adaptation of local models under heterogeneous data
scenarios. Experiments on Databricks-Dolly-15k and Natural Instructions with
LLaMA2-7B and Deepseek-7B confirm that our method improves global performance
by 0.39% and local performance by 0.59%.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QeRL, a new quantization-enhanced reinforcement learning framework, improves efficiency and performance in training large language models (LLMs), enabling RL training on a single GPU with faster speed and enhanced accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs require reinforcement learning for advanced reasoning capabilities but face challenges like high GPU memory and long training durations; QeRL seeks to address these inefficiencies.

Method: Combines NVFP4 quantization with LoRA to reduce memory usage and accelerate RL training. Introduces Adaptive Quantization Noise (AQN) for dynamic noise adjustment during training, enhancing exploration.

Result: Delivers over 1.5x speedup in rollout phase, enables RL training of a 32B LLM on a single H100 GPU, and achieves faster reward growth and higher accuracy than alternatives.

Conclusion: QeRL advances RL training in LLMs by making it more resource-efficient and effective, matching full-parameter fine-tuning performance for mathematical benchmarks.

Abstract: We propose QeRL, a Quantization-enhanced Reinforcement Learning framework for
large language models (LLMs). While RL is essential for LLMs' reasoning
capabilities, it is resource-intensive, requiring substantial GPU memory and
long rollout durations. QeRL addresses these issues by combining NVFP4
quantization with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), accelerating rollout phase of RL
while reducing memory overhead. Beyond efficiency, our findings show that
quantization noise increases policy entropy, enhancing exploration, and
enabling the discovery of better strategies during RL. To further optimize
exploration, QeRL introduces an Adaptive Quantization Noise (AQN) mechanism,
which dynamically adjusts noise during training. Experiments demonstrate that
QeRL delivers over 1.5 times speedup in the rollout phase. Moreover, this is
the first framework to enable RL training of a 32B LLM on a single H100 80GB
GPU, while delivering overall speedups for RL training. It also achieves faster
reward growth and higher final accuracy than 16-bit LoRA and QLoRA, while
matching the performance of full-parameter fine-tuning on mathematical
benchmarks such as GSM8K (90.8%) and MATH 500 (77.4%) in the 7B model. These
results establish QeRL as an efficient and effective framework for RL training
in LLMs.

*Ning Yang,Hengyu Zhong,Haijun Zhang,Randall Berry*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ST-Vision-LLM, which uses a vision-language fusion to enhance spatiotemporal traffic forecasting, overcoming limitations in modeling spatial dependencies with LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of accurately forecasting spatiotemporal traffic data while overcoming the inefficiency of LLMs in handling dense grid-based spatial dependencies and numerical data.

Method: The proposed ST-Vision-LLM uses a Vision-LLM visual encoder to process global traffic matrices as image sequences. A specialized encoding scheme is introduced to handle numerical data efficiently, and the model is fine-tuned with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO).

Result: The method outperforms existing techniques, achieving a 15.6% improvement in long-term prediction accuracy and over 30.04% better performance in cross-domain few-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: ST-Vision-LLM demonstrates strong generalization and efficiency, making it suitable for spatiotemporal traffic forecasting in diverse and data-scarce environments.

Abstract: Accurate spatiotemporal traffic forecasting is a critical prerequisite for
proactive resource management in dense urban mobile networks. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in time series analysis, they
inherently struggle to model the complex spatial dependencies of grid-based
traffic data. Effectively extending LLMs to this domain is challenging, as
representing the vast amount of information from dense geographical grids can
be inefficient and overwhelm the model's context. To address these challenges,
we propose ST-Vision-LLM, a novel framework that reframes spatiotemporal
forecasting as a vision-language fusion problem. Our approach leverages a
Vision-LLM visual encoder to process historical global traffic matrices as
image sequences, providing the model with a comprehensive global view to inform
cell-level predictions. To overcome the inefficiency of LLMs in handling
numerical data, we introduce an efficient encoding scheme that represents
floating-point values as single tokens via a specialized vocabulary, coupled
with a two-stage numerical alignment fine-tuning process. The model is first
trained with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and then further optimized for
predictive accuracy using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a
memory-efficient reinforcement learning method. Evaluations on real-world
mobile traffic datasets demonstrate that ST-Vision-LLM outperforms existing
methods by 15.6% in long-term prediction accuracy and exceeds the second-best
baseline by over 30.04% in cross-domain few-shot scenarios. Our extensive
experiments validate the model's strong generalization capabilities across
various data-scarce environments.

Method: Defines RL environments with user-specified control actions, observations, and a reward-driven control objective, wrapping TORAX to simulate the dynamics.

Result: Gym-TORAX creates RL-compatible environments for plasma control challenges, with a specific example being ITER ramp-up plasma dynamics.

Conclusion: Facilitates exploration and advancements in RL applied to tokamak plasma control by offering a structured, adaptable simulation tool.

Abstract: This paper presents Gym-TORAX, a Python package enabling the implementation
of Reinforcement Learning (RL) environments for simulating plasma dynamics and
control in tokamaks. Users define succinctly a set of control actions and
observations, and a control objective from which Gym-TORAX creates a Gymnasium
environment that wraps TORAX for simulating the plasma dynamics. The objective
is formulated through rewards depending on the simulated state of the plasma
and control action to optimize specific characteristics of the plasma, such as
performance and stability. The resulting environment instance is then
compatible with a wide range of RL algorithms and libraries and will facilitate
RL research in plasma control. In its current version, one environment is
readily available, based on a ramp-up scenario of the International
Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER).

*Wenbo Wu,Qingyi Si,Xiurui Pan,Ye Wang,Jie Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LouisKV introduces an efficient retrieval framework for reducing memory overhead in Key-Value cache for long-sequence scenarios, optimizing accuracy and computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses memory overhead and efficiency bottlenecks in Key-Value cache management during long-sequence reasoning using auto-regressive models.

Method: LouisKV uses semantic-aware retrieval leveraging temporal locality, fine-grained management tailored to input/output sequences, and kernel-level optimizations like Triton and CUDA to improve retrieval efficiency.

Result: LouisKV achieves up to 4.7× speedup compared to existing methods, with minimal accuracy loss across various long-sequence tasks.

Conclusion: LouisKV provides an optimized framework for KV cache retrieval, ensuring efficient and accurate processing in long-sequence reasoning scenarios.

Abstract: While Key-Value (KV) cache succeeds in reducing redundant computations in
auto-regressive models, it introduces significant memory overhead, limiting its
practical deployment in long-sequence scenarios. Existing KV retrieval methods
mitigate this by dynamically retaining only a subset of KV entries on the GPU.
However, they still suffer from notable efficiency and accuracy bottlenecks due
to per-token retrieval and coarse-grained page-level KV management, especially
in long-output reasoning scenarios. With the emergence of large reasoning
models, efficiently handling such scenarios has become increasingly important.
To address this issue, we present two key observations: (1) critical KVs
exhibit strong temporal locality during decoding, and (2) these KVs exhibit
distinct distribution patterns across the input prompt and generated output.
Building on these observations, we propose LouisKV, an efficient KV cache
retrieval framework designed for various long-sequence scenarios. Specifically,
LouisKV introduces a semantic-aware retrieval strategy leveraging temporal
locality to trigger retrieval only at semantic boundaries, drastically reducing
computation and data transfer overhead. LouisKV also designs a decoupled,
fine-grained management scheme that tailors differentiated strategies for input
and output sequences to create retrieval units that better match the model's
attention patterns, enabling precise identification of critical KVs.
Furthermore, to boost efficiency, LouisKV incorporates several kernel-level
optimizations, including custom Triton and CUDA kernels to accelerate the KV
clustering and retrieval. Evaluations show that LouisKV achieves up to
4.7$\times$ speedup over state-of-the-art KV retrieval methods while
maintaining near-lossless accuracy across diverse long-sequence tasks,
including long-input short-output, short-input long-output, and long-input
long-output scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DiffTSST, a framework for style transfer in time series using content-style disentanglement and diffusion processes, and validates its effectiveness for data augmentation and anomaly detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Style transfer in time series data is underdeveloped despite the utility of combining content and style for applications like data augmentation and improving model generalization in data-scarce domains.

Method: DiffTSST uses convolutional encoders to disentangle time series into content and style, combined through an attention-based self-supervised diffusion process, enabling generation of new samples by transferring styles between signals.

Result: DiffTSST achieves effective style transfer demonstrated through qualitative and quantitative experiments, showing its utility in data augmentation and enhanced anomaly detection performance.

Conclusion: The framework proves valuable for time series applications, particularly for resolving challenges in scenarios with limited data, and opens the door to improved machine learning model robustness.

Abstract: Style transfer combines the content of one signal with the style of another.
It supports applications such as data augmentation and scenario simulation,
helping machine learning models generalize in data-scarce domains. While well
developed in vision and language, style transfer methods for time series data
remain limited. We introduce DiffTSST, a diffusion-based framework that
disentangles a time series into content and style representations via
convolutional encoders and recombines them through a self-supervised
attention-based diffusion process. At inference, encoders extract content and
style from two distinct series, enabling conditional generation of novel
samples to achieve style transfer. We demonstrate both qualitatively and
quantitatively that DiffTSST achieves effective style transfer. We further
validate its real-world utility by showing that data augmentation with DiffTSST
improves anomaly detection in data-scarce regimes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces EVP, a framework for improving dynamic graph neural networks with historical event knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dynamic graph learning methods often ignore the importance of historical events when modeling relationships.

Method: The framework uses an event adaptation mechanism to align historical event characteristics with tasks and an event aggregation mechanism to integrate these into node representations.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on four publicly available datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed EVP framework.

Conclusion: EVP enhances existing methods by leveraging historical event knowledge, improving dynamic graph learning capabilities.

Abstract: Real-world graph typically evolve via a series of events, modeling dynamic
interactions between objects across various domains. For dynamic graph
learning, dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) have emerged as popular
solutions. Recently, prompt learning methods have been explored on dynamic
graphs. However, existing methods generally focus on capturing the relationship
between nodes and time, while overlooking the impact of historical events. In
this paper, we propose EVP, an event-aware dynamic graph prompt learning
framework that can serve as a plug-in to existing methods, enhancing their
ability to leverage historical events knowledge. First, we extract a series of
historical events for each node and introduce an event adaptation mechanism to
align the fine-grained characteristics of these events with downstream tasks.
Second, we propose an event aggregation mechanism to effectively integrate
historical knowledge into node representations. Finally, we conduct extensive
experiments on four public datasets to evaluate and analyze EVP.

TL;DR: ROLL Flash leverages asynchronous reinforcement learning post-training to enhance scalability and resource utilization in Large Language Models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reinforcement learning (RL) post-training methods for LLMs face limitations in resource utilization and scalability.

Method: ROLL Flash is built on principles of fine-grained parallelism and rollout-train decoupling, enabling asynchronous training with flexible interfaces and efficient rollout mechanisms.

Result: Experiments show up to 2.24x speedup on RLVR tasks and 2.72x on agentic tasks compared to synchronous baselines, while maintaining comparable performance.

Conclusion: ROLL Flash improves efficiency and scalability in RL post-training for LLMs, showcasing asynchronous training as a viable alternative to traditional synchronous approaches.

Abstract: Synchronous Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training has emerged as a
crucial step for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with diverse
capabilities. However, many systems designed to accelerate RL post-training
still suffer from low resource utilization and limited scalability. We present
ROLL Flash, a system that extends ROLL with native support for asynchronous RL
post-training. ROLL Flash is built upon two core design principles:
fine-grained parallelism and rollout-train decoupling. Guided by these
principles, ROLL Flash provides flexible programming interfaces that enable a
fully asynchronous training architecture and support efficient rollout
mechanisms, including queue scheduling and environment-level asynchronous
execution. Through comprehensive theoretical analysis and extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that ROLL Flash significantly improves resource
utilization and scalability over synchronous RL post-training. ROLL Flash
achieves up to 2.24x speedup on RLVR tasks and 2.72x on agentic tasks, using
the same GPU budget as synchronous baselines. Furthermore, we implement several
popular off-policy algorithms and verify that asynchronous training can achieve
performance on par with synchronous training.

*Etzion Harari,Moshe Unger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Multi-view Feature Propagation (MFP) framework to enhance node classification in graph neural networks by addressing feature sparsity and privacy risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world graph learning scenarios often suffer from highly sparse or sensitive node features, leading to degraded performance and privacy risks when these features are exposed to adversaries.

Method: The MFP framework improves feature propagation by splitting features into multiple Gaussian-noised views, each independently propagating through the graph's structure. The aggregated results balance robustness and privacy.

Result: Experiments show MFP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in node classification and significantly reduces privacy leakage. It offers alternative imputations for missing features without reconstructing sensitive data.

Conclusion: MFP is an effective and privacy-aware solution for graph learning, addressing challenges of feature sparsity and privacy preservation while maintaining strong node classification performance across diverse applications.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in node
classification tasks over relational data, yet their effectiveness often
depends on the availability of complete node features. In many real-world
scenarios, however, feature matrices are highly sparse or contain sensitive
information, leading to degraded performance and increased privacy risks.
Furthermore, direct exposure of information can result in unintended data
leakage, enabling adversaries to infer sensitive information. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel Multi-view Feature Propagation (MFP) framework
that enhances node classification under feature sparsity while promoting
privacy preservation. MFP extends traditional Feature Propagation (FP) by
dividing the available features into multiple Gaussian-noised views, each
propagating information independently through the graph topology. The
aggregated representations yield expressive and robust node embeddings. This
framework is novel in two respects: it introduces a mechanism that improves
robustness under extreme sparsity, and it provides a principled way to balance
utility with privacy. Extensive experiments conducted on graph datasets
demonstrate that MFP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in node
classification while substantially reducing privacy leakage. Moreover, our
analysis demonstrates that propagated outputs serve as alternative imputations
rather than reconstructions of the original features, preserving utility
without compromising privacy. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis further
confirms the stability and practical applicability of MFP across diverse
scenarios. Overall, MFP provides an effective and privacy-aware framework for
graph learning in domains characterized by missing or sensitive features.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs handle medical knowledge, including where specific information is stored and processed, in order to guide improvements in their fine-tuning and application performance.

Method: Four interpretability techniques were used: (1) UMAP projections of activations, (2) gradient-based saliency mapping, (3) layer lesioning, and (4) activation patching.

Result: Key patterns of medical knowledge storage and processing were identified across five LLMs. Specific findings include non-linear encoding of age, circular disease progression representations, and drug clustering patterns, especially in Llama3.3-70B.

Conclusion: The study offers insights into the inner workings of LLMs in the medical domain, highlighting layer-specific knowledge processing and variability between models, which can inform future research on optimization and bias correction.

Abstract: We present a systematic study of medical-domain interpretability in Large
Language Models (LLMs). We study how the LLMs both represent and process
medical knowledge through four different interpretability techniques: (1) UMAP
projections of intermediate activations, (2) gradient-based saliency with
respect to the model weights, (3) layer lesioning/removal and (4) activation
patching. We present knowledge maps of five LLMs which show, at a
coarse-resolution, where knowledge about patient's ages, medical symptoms,
diseases and drugs is stored in the models. In particular for Llama3.3-70B, we
find that most medical knowledge is processed in the first half of the model's
layers. In addition, we find several interesting phenomena: (i) age is often
encoded in a non-linear and sometimes discontinuous manner at intermediate
layers in the models, (ii) the disease progression representation is
non-monotonic and circular at certain layers of the model, (iii) in
Llama3.3-70B, drugs cluster better by medical specialty rather than mechanism
of action, especially for Llama3.3-70B and (iv) Gemma3-27B and MedGemma-27B
have activations that collapse at intermediate layers but recover by the final
layers. These results can guide future research on fine-tuning, un-learning or
de-biasing LLMs for medical tasks by suggesting at which layers in the model
these techniques should be applied.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the persistent memory limitations that hinder the deployment of Federated Learning on mobile devices, while maintaining data privacy.

Method: FedHybrid selects participating devices based on memory budget, computing capability, and data diversity, and employs a hybrid of recomputation and compression techniques to reduce memory usage during local training.

Result: Extensive experiments show that FedHybrid improves model accuracy by up to 39.1% and reduces wall clock training time by 15.5× under various memory constraints.

Conclusion: FedHybrid successfully enhances the viability of Federated Learning on memory-limited devices by balancing memory reduction with training efficiency and accuracy preservation.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) emerges as a new learning paradigm that enables
multiple devices to collaboratively train a shared model while preserving data
privacy. However, one fundamental and prevailing challenge that hinders the
deployment of FL on mobile devices is the memory limitation. This paper
proposes \textit{FedHybrid}, a novel framework that effectively reduces the
memory footprint during the training process while guaranteeing the model
accuracy and the overall training progress. Specifically, \textit{FedHybrid}
first selects the participating devices for each training round by jointly
evaluating their memory budget, computing capability, and data diversity. After
that, it judiciously analyzes the computational graph and generates an
execution plan for each selected client in order to meet the corresponding
memory budget while minimizing the training delay through employing a hybrid of
recomputation and compression techniques according to the characteristic of
each tensor. During the local training process, \textit{FedHybrid} carries out
the execution plan with a well-designed activation compression technique to
effectively achieve memory reduction with minimum accuracy loss. We conduct
extensive experiments to evaluate \textit{FedHybrid} on both simulation and
off-the-shelf mobile devices. The experiment results demonstrate that
\textit{FedHybrid} achieves up to a 39.1\% increase in model accuracy and a
15.5$\times$ reduction in wall clock time under various memory budgets compared
with the baselines.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a human-AI collaborative pipeline using large language models (LLMs) to streamline systematic literature reviews (SLRs), significantly reducing effort and errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SLRs are essential for understanding research landscapes, but retrieving and filtering relevant literature is labor-intensive and inefficient with conventional methods.

Method: A pipeline uses multiple LLMs with descriptive prompts, leveraged through a consensus scheme and a human-supervised visual analytics interface, LLMSurver, for real-time interaction and adjustments.

Result: The pipeline notably minimizes manual effort, achieves lower error rates than individual human annotators, and proves modern open-source LLMs sufficient for cost-effective application.

Conclusion: Responsible integration of human-AI collaboration accelerates and improves SLR processes, demonstrating its practicality in academic workflows.

Abstract: The creation of systematic literature reviews (SLR) is critical for analyzing
the landscape of a research field and guiding future research directions.
However, retrieving and filtering the literature corpus for an SLR is highly
time-consuming and requires extensive manual effort, as keyword-based searches
in digital libraries often return numerous irrelevant publications. In this
work, we propose a pipeline leveraging multiple large language models (LLMs),
classifying papers based on descriptive prompts and deciding jointly using a
consensus scheme. The entire process is human-supervised and interactively
controlled via our open-source visual analytics web interface, LLMSurver, which
enables real-time inspection and modification of model outputs. We evaluate our
approach using ground-truth data from a recent SLR comprising over 8,000
candidate papers, benchmarking both open and commercial state-of-the-art LLMs
from mid-2024 and fall 2025. Results demonstrate that our pipeline
significantly reduces manual effort while achieving lower error rates than
single human annotators. Furthermore, modern open-source models prove
sufficient for this task, making the method accessible and cost-effective.
Overall, our work demonstrates how responsible human-AI collaboration can
accelerate and enhance systematic literature reviews within academic workflows.

Its effectiveness is evaluated through MSE, MAE, FID metrics, expert cardiologist Turing tests, and downstream tasks using the ECGFounder model fine-tuned on over 40 cardiac conditions.

Result: The WearECG model produces realistic and diagnostically valuable 12-lead ECG signals from three-lead inputs, demonstrating strong performance on the MIMIC dataset across multiple evaluation metrics and tasks.

Conclusion: This approach highlights the promise of generative modeling for creating scalable, cost-effective methods for cardiac screening, closing the gap between traditional and portable ECG systems.

Abstract: Twelve-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) are the clinical gold standard for
cardiac diagnosis, providing comprehensive spatial coverage of the heart
necessary to detect conditions such as myocardial infarction (MI). However,
their lack of portability limits continuous and large-scale use. Three-lead ECG
systems are widely used in wearable devices due to their simplicity and
mobility, but they often fail to capture pathologies in unmeasured regions. To
address this, we propose WearECG, a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) method that
reconstructs twelve-lead ECGs from three leads: II, V1, and V5. Our model
includes architectural improvements to better capture temporal and spatial
dependencies in ECG signals. We evaluate generation quality using MSE, MAE, and
Frechet Inception Distance (FID), and assess clinical validity via a Turing
test with expert cardiologists. To further validate diagnostic utility, we
fine-tune ECGFounder, a large-scale pretrained ECG model, on a multi-label
classification task involving over 40 cardiac conditions, including six
different myocardial infarction locations, using both real and generated
signals. Experiments on the MIMIC dataset show that our method produces
physiologically realistic and diagnostically informative signals, with robust
performance in downstream tasks. This work demonstrates the potential of
generative modeling for ECG reconstruction and its implications for scalable,
low-cost cardiac screening.

### [690] [Iterative Amortized Inference: Unifying In-Context Learning and Learned Optimizers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11471)
*Sarthak Mittal,Divyat Mahajan,Guillaume Lajoie,Mohammad Pezeshki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified framework and taxonomy for amortized learning methods, identifies scalability issues, and proposes iterative amortized inference to address large dataset limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance rapid generalization across tasks by systematically categorizing existing amortized learning methods while addressing their scalability limitations.

Method: A taxonomy is introduced categorizing models into parametric, implicit, and explicit regimes based on task adaptation, followed by proposing iterative amortized inference inspired by stochastic optimization.

Result: Iterative amortized inference enhances scalability by processing task data over mini-batches and bridges optimization-based meta-learning with forward-pass amortization methods.

Conclusion: The approach provides a scalable and extensible foundation for task adaptation, making it suitable for general-purpose applications.

Abstract: Modern learning systems increasingly rely on amortized learning - the idea of
reusing computation or inductive biases shared across tasks to enable rapid
generalization to novel problems. This principle spans a range of approaches,
including meta-learning, in-context learning, prompt tuning, learned optimizers
and more. While motivated by similar goals, these approaches differ in how they
encode and leverage task-specific information, often provided as in-context
examples. In this work, we propose a unified framework which describes how such
methods differ primarily in the aspects of learning they amortize - such as
initializations, learned updates, or predictive mappings - and how they
incorporate task data at inference. We introduce a taxonomy that categorizes
amortized models into parametric, implicit, and explicit regimes, based on
whether task adaptation is externalized, internalized, or jointly modeled.
Building on this view, we identify a key limitation in current approaches: most
methods struggle to scale to large datasets because their capacity to process
task data at inference (e.g., context length) is often limited. To address
this, we propose iterative amortized inference, a class of models that refine
solutions step-by-step over mini-batches, drawing inspiration from stochastic
optimization. Our formulation bridges optimization-based meta-learning with
forward-pass amortization in models like LLMs, offering a scalable and
extensible foundation for general-purpose task adaptation.

### [691] [Differentiable Fast Top-K Selection for Large-Scale Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11472)
*Yanjie Zhu,Zhen Zhang,Yunli Wang,Zhiqiang Wang,Yu Li,Rufan Zhou,Shiyang Wen,Peng Jiang,Chenhao Lin,Jian Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes DFTopK, a differentiable Top-K selection operator for use in large-scale recommendation systems that achieves optimal linear time complexity, improves training efficiency, and demonstrates superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ranking in information retrieval systems is hindered by the non-differentiability of the Top-K operator. Existing solutions either suffer from objective misalignment or gradient conflicts, and existing differentiable operators are computationally expensive.

Method: DFTopK relaxes normalization constraints and avoids sorting to enable a closed-form solution with $O(n)$ complexity, addressing inefficiencies and conflicts in current differentiable sorting-based methods.

Result: DFTopK showed improved training efficiency, superior performance on benchmarks, and a +1.77% revenue lift in online A/B tests compared to baseline systems.

Conclusion: DFTopK represents a breakthrough in differentiable rank selection by achieving optimal linear complexity and demonstrating its applicability and effectiveness in recommendation systems.

Abstract: Cascade ranking is a widely adopted paradigm in large-scale information
retrieval systems for Top-K item selection. However, the Top-K operator is
non-differentiable, hindering end-to-end training. Existing methods include
Learning-to-Rank approaches (e.g., LambdaLoss), which optimize ranking metrics
like NDCG and suffer from objective misalignment, and differentiable
sorting-based methods (e.g., ARF, LCRON), which relax permutation matrices for
direct Top-K optimization but introduce gradient conflicts through matrix
aggregation. A promising alternative is to directly construct a differentiable
approximation of the Top-K selection operator, bypassing the use of soft
permutation matrices. However, even state-of-the-art differentiable Top-K
operator (e.g., LapSum) require $O(n \log n)$ complexity due to their
dependence on sorting for solving the threshold. Thus, we propose DFTopK, a
novel differentiable Top-K operator achieving optimal $O(n)$ time complexity.
By relaxing normalization constraints, DFTopK admits a closed-form solution and
avoids sorting. DFTopK also avoids the gradient conflicts inherent in
differentiable sorting-based methods. We evaluate DFTopK on both the public
benchmark RecFLow and an industrial system. Experimental results show that
DFTopK significantly improves training efficiency while achieving superior
performance, which enables us to scale up training samples more efficiently. In
the online A/B test, DFTopK yielded a +1.77\% revenue lift with the same
computational budget compared to the baseline. To the best of our knowledge,
this work is the first to introduce differentiable Top-K operators into
recommendation systems and the first to achieve theoretically optimal
linear-time complexity for Top-K selection. We have open-sourced our
implementation to facilitate future research in both academia and industry.

### [692] [Offline Reinforcement Learning with Generative Trajectory Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11499)
*Xinsong Feng,Leshu Tang,Chenan Wang,Haipeng Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Generative Trajectory Policies (GTPs), a novel paradigm for offline reinforcement learning that bridges the gap between slow, high-performing generative models and fast, lower-performing ones using an ODE framework. It achieves state-of-the-art results on challenging benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative models for offline RL face a trade-off: slower models like diffusion policies are accurate but computationally expensive, while faster models like consistency policies have degraded performance. The authors aim to bridge this trade-off.

Method: The paper unifies existing generative models (diffusion, flow matching, consistency) under a framework based on learning continuous-time generative trajectories governed by an ODE. It introduces GTPs to learn the entire solution map of this ODE, with additional adaptations for practical use in offline RL.

Result: Empirical tests show that GTPs achieve state-of-the-art results on D4RL benchmarks, excelling in difficult tasks like AntMaze with perfect scores.

Conclusion: GTPs overcome limitations of existing methods by providing a general and computationally efficient framework, significantly advancing the performance of generative models in offline reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Generative models have emerged as a powerful class of policies for offline
reinforcement learning (RL) due to their ability to capture complex,
multi-modal behaviors. However, existing methods face a stark trade-off: slow,
iterative models like diffusion policies are computationally expensive, while
fast, single-step models like consistency policies often suffer from degraded
performance. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to bridge this
gap. The key to moving beyond the limitations of individual methods, we argue,
lies in a unifying perspective that views modern generative models, including
diffusion, flow matching, and consistency models, as specific instances of
learning a continuous-time generative trajectory governed by an Ordinary
Differential Equation (ODE). This principled foundation provides a clearer
design space for generative policies in RL and allows us to propose Generative
Trajectory Policies (GTPs), a new and more general policy paradigm that learns
the entire solution map of the underlying ODE. To make this paradigm practical
for offline RL, we further introduce two key theoretically principled
adaptations. Empirical results demonstrate that GTP achieves state-of-the-art
performance on D4RL benchmarks - it significantly outperforms prior generative
policies, achieving perfect scores on several notoriously hard AntMaze tasks.

### [693] [Learning to Make MISTAKEs: Modeling Incorrect Student Thinking And Key Errors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11502)
*Alexis Ross,Jacob Andreas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MISTAKE, a method to generate synthetic reasoning errors and improve educational tasks like student simulation and misconception classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to model incorrect reasoning patterns for applications like simulating student errors and providing real-time feedback in educational contexts.

Method: MISTAKE leverages cycle consistency to link incorrect answers with misconceptions and uses generated data to train models for educational tasks.

Result: Evaluations demonstrate improved accuracy in simulating student errors, better misconception inference, and enhanced alignment with expert distractor answers.

Conclusion: MISTAKE shows promise in generating realistic reasoning errors, with practical implications for educational tools and training educators.

Abstract: Research on reasoning in language models (LMs) predominantly focuses on
improving the correctness of their outputs. But some important applications
require modeling reasoning patterns that are incorrect. For example, automated
systems that can reason about and simulate student errors are useful for
providing real-time feedback in the classroom or offline practice for
educators-in-training. This paper presents a new method, MISTAKE, that (1)
constructs high-quality synthetic examples of reasoning errors by leveraging
cycle consistency between incorrect answers and latent misconceptions; and (2)
uses the generated data to learn models for student simulation, misconception
classification, and answer generation. We evaluate MISTAKE on three educational
tasks and find that it results in (1) higher accuracy when simulating incorrect
student answers based on specific misconceptions, (2) increased performance
inferring latent misconceptions from observed incorrect answers, and (3) higher
alignment with expert-written distractor answers when generating incorrect
answers (e.g., for multiple-choice tests).

### [694] [Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning Models to Upscale Evapotranspiration in the U.S. Midwest](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11505)
*Aleksei Rozanov,Samikshya Subedi,Vasudha Sharma,Bryan C. Runck*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper compares tree-based and knowledge-guided machine learning models to scale evapotranspiration (ET) using remote sensing and meteorological data in the Midwest United States, finding that LightGBM with knowledge-guided features performs best.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of accurately quantifying evapotranspiration (ET) across various spatial and temporal scales, crucial for applications in land-atmosphere interactions and agriculture.

Method: The study integrates tree-based and knowledge-guided machine learning models with multispectral remote sensing data and meteorological data. It compares several models (Random Forest, CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM, and a feed-forward neural network), using k-fold cross-validation and site stratified splits to ensure accuracy.

Result: LightGBM with knowledge-guided features achieved the best performance with an R2 of 0.86, MSE of 14.99 W m^-2, and MAE of 8.82 W m^-2. Knowledge-guided features were found to be essential in model predictions.

Conclusion: The developed model enhances evapotranspiration estimation accuracy and provides a high-resolution gridded ET data product that aligns well with state-level weather station estimates, showcasing potential for large-scale agricultural and environmental applications.

Abstract: Evapotranspiration (ET) plays a critical role in the land-atmosphere
interactions, yet its accurate quantification across various spatiotemporal
scales remains a challenge. In situ measurement approaches, like eddy
covariance (EC) or weather station-based ET estimation, allow for measuring ET
at a single location. Agricultural uses of ET require estimates for each field
over broad areas, making it infeasible to deploy sensing systems at each
location. This study integrates tree-based and knowledge-guided machine
learning (ML) techniques with multispectral remote sensing data, griddled
meteorology and EC data to upscale ET across the Midwest United States. We
compare four tree-based models - Random Forest, CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM -
and a simple feed-forward artificial neural network in combination with
features engineered using knowledge-guided ML principles. Models were trained
and tested on EC towers located in the Midwest of the United States using
k-fold cross validation with k=5 and site-year, biome stratified train-test
split to avoid data leakage. Results show that LightGBM with knowledge-guided
features outperformed other methods with an R2=0.86, MSE=14.99 W m^-2 and MAE =
8.82 W m^-2 according to grouped k-fold validation (k=5). Feature importance
analysis shows that knowledge-guided features were most important for
predicting evapotranspiration. Using the best performing model, we provide a
data product at 500 m spatial and one-day temporal resolution for gridded ET
for the period of 2019-2024. Intercomparison between the new gridded product
and state-level weather station-based ET estimates show best-in-class
correspondence.

*Yuchen Yan,Zhihua Liu,Hao Wang,Weiming Li,Xiaoshuai Hao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a graph representation learning framework to improve retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems for multi-hop questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-hop questions challenge RAG systems as they require understanding complex semantics and retrieving multiple relevant knowledge targets, often facing issues like irrelevant noise.

Method: The approach introduces a Multi-information Level Knowledge Graph (Multi-L KG) and a Query-Specific Graph Neural Network (QSGNN) with advanced intra/inter-level message passing mechanisms guided by the query. Two data generation strategies are also proposed for pre-training.

Result: Experimental results show that the framework leads to significant improvements in multi-hop scenarios, achieving up to 33.8% better performance in high-hop questions.

Conclusion: The proposed graph representation method, QSGNN, effectively addresses multi-hop question challenges in RAG setups by improving semantic understanding and reducing noise impact, proving its robustness and utility.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has demonstrated its ability to enhance
Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge sources.
However, multi-hop questions, which require the identification of multiple
knowledge targets to form a synthesized answer, raise new challenges for RAG
systems. Under the multi-hop settings, existing methods often struggle to fully
understand the questions with complex semantic structures and are susceptible
to irrelevant noise during the retrieval of multiple information targets. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel graph representation learning
framework for multi-hop question retrieval. We first introduce a
Multi-information Level Knowledge Graph (Multi-L KG) to model various
information levels for a more comprehensive understanding of multi-hop
questions. Based on this, we design a Query-Specific Graph Neural Network
(QSGNN) for representation learning on the Multi-L KG. QSGNN employs
intra/inter-level message passing mechanisms, and in each message passing the
information aggregation is guided by the query, which not only facilitates
multi-granular information aggregation but also significantly reduces the
impact of noise. To enhance its ability to learn robust representations, we
further propose two synthesized data generation strategies for pre-training the
QSGNN. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework in multi-hop scenarios, especially in high-hop questions the
improvement can reach 33.8\%. The code is available at:

expression can be used to classify instances in the knowledge graph.
Furthermore, Ontolearn integrates a verbalization module based on an LLM to
translate complex OWL class expressions into natural language sentences. By
mapping OWL class expressions into respective SPARQL queries, Ontolearn can be
easily used to operate over a remote triplestore. The source code of Ontolearn

### [697] [Attention Factors for Statistical Arbitrage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11616)
*Elliot L. Epstein,Rose Wang,Jaewon Choi,Markus Pelger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for statistical arbitrage that leverages conditional latent factors, called Attention Factors, to optimize trading strategies and achieve high risk-adjusted returns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a robust framework for statistical arbitrage that identifies similar assets through factors, detects mispricing, and maximizes trading profitability after accounting for costs.

Method: The authors introduce Attention Factors, derived from firm characteristic embeddings, and combine them with a sequence model to identify time-series signals. They jointly estimate factors and trading strategies for optimal results.

Result: The model achieves an out-of-sample Sharpe ratio above 4 on U.S. equities over 24 years, with a net Sharpe ratio of 2.3 after transaction costs.

Conclusion: Jointly estimating factors and arbitrage strategies, as well as incorporating weak factors, significantly improves profitability and trading performance.

Abstract: Statistical arbitrage exploits temporal price differences between similar
assets. We develop a framework to jointly identify similar assets through
factors, identify mispricing and form a trading policy that maximizes
risk-adjusted performance after trading costs. Our Attention Factors are
conditional latent factors that are the most useful for arbitrage trading. They
are learned from firm characteristic embeddings that allow for complex
interactions. We identify time-series signals from the residual portfolios of
our factors with a general sequence model. Estimating factors and the arbitrage
trading strategy jointly is crucial to maximize profitability after trading
costs. In a comprehensive empirical study we show that our Attention Factor
model achieves an out-of-sample Sharpe ratio above 4 on the largest U.S.
equities over a 24-year period. Our one-step solution yields an unprecedented
Sharpe ratio of 2.3 net of transaction costs. We show that weak factors are
important for arbitrage trading.

### [698] [MATH-Beyond: A Benchmark for RL to Expand Beyond the Base Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11653)
*Prasanna Mayilvahanan,Ricardo Dominguez-Olmedo,Thaddäus Wiedemer,Wieland Brendel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces the MATH-Beyond (MATH-B) benchmark to challenge and evaluate reinforcement learning (RL) methods' ability to improve mathematical reasoning beyond base model capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL methods for large language models (LLMs) primarily enhance solution mechanisms within current model capabilities without fostering entirely new reasoning approaches.

Method: The authors developed the MATH-B benchmark, containing challenging math problems from subsets of the DAPO-Math-17K and DeepScaleR datasets designed to surpass the capabilities of open-source models with up to 8 billion parameters.

Result: Current RL fine-tuned models, such as Nemotron-Research-Reasoning-Qwen-1.5B and DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview, show poor performance on the MATH-B benchmark even with extensive sampling (pass@1024), highlighting the insufficiency of existing methods.

Conclusion: The MATH-B benchmark should encourage research into exploration-driven RL methods to advance deeper mathematical reasoning in LLMs. The dataset is publicly released to support such efforts.

Abstract: With the advent of DeepSeek-R1, a new wave of reinforcement learning (RL)
methods has emerged that seem to unlock stronger mathematical reasoning.
However, a closer look at the open-source ecosystem reveals a critical
limitation: with sufficiently many draws (e.g., $\texttt{pass@1024}$), many
existing base models already solve nearly all questions on widely used math
benchmarks such as MATH-500 and AIME 2024. This suggests that the RL
fine-tuning methods prevalent in the LLM reasoning literature largely sharpen
existing solution modes rather than discovering entirely new ones. Such
sharpening stands in contrast to the broader promise of RL: to foster
exploration and to acquire new skills. To move beyond this plateau, we
introduce MATH-Beyond (MATH-B), a benchmark deliberately constructed to defeat
common open-source models of up to 8B parameters even under large sampling
budgets. Improving performance on our benchmark via RL requires methods that
learn to reason in ways that go beyond base model capabilities in repeated
sampling. Since the problems are drawn from subsets of DAPO-Math-17K and
DeepScaleR datasets, they remain topically equivalent to standard high-school
math. Validating our premise, RL fine-tuned models such as
Nemotron-Research-Reasoning-Qwen-1.5B and DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview perform
poorly on MATH-B at $\texttt{pass@1024}$, showing how existing approaches fall
short on tackling harder instances. We hope MATH-B will catalyze
exploration-driven RL approaches that elicit deeper reasoning capabilities. We
release MATH-B at https://huggingface.co/datasets/brendel-group/MATH-Beyond.

*Songrun He,Linying Lv,Asaf Manela,Jimmy Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a family of instruction-following language models trained without future data, eliminating lookahead bias to improve prediction reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address lookahead bias in AI models by ensuring they are trained only on pre-cutoff data, making predictions more reliable for researchers.

Method: The approach trains large language models using data available only before a specified cutoff date, ensuring temporal data separation.

Result: The developed models provide replicable predictions, an open conversational interface, and a measure of forecast accuracy without data leakage.

Conclusion: The models offer a reliable AI framework free of lookahead bias, suitable for prediction tasks and research applications.

Abstract: We introduce a family of chronologically consistent, instruction-following
large language models to eliminate lookahead bias. Each model is trained only
on data available before a clearly defined knowledge-cutoff date, ensuring
strict temporal separation from any post-cutoff data. The resulting framework
offers (i) a simple, conversational chat interface, (ii) fully open, fixed
model weights that guarantee replicability, and (iii) a conservative lower
bound on forecast accuracy, isolating the share of predictability that survives
once training leakage is removed. Together, these features provide researchers
with an easy-to-use generative AI tool useful for a wide range of prediction
tasks that is free of lookahead bias.

*Jens Tuyls,Dylan J. Foster,Akshay Krishnamurthy,Jordan T. Ash*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the role of deliberate exploration in improving the performance of pre-trained language models using a representation-based diversity bonus.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if reinforcement learning techniques lead to the discovery of new behaviors or refine existing ones in language models and explore how pre-trained knowledge can guide exploration.

Method: The study employs a representation-based exploration bonus derived from language model hidden states, integrating it into both inference-time scaling and RL-based post-training.

Result: For inference-time, diversity exploration consistently boosts pass@k rates and verifier efficiency in reasoning tasks. In post-training, it enhances reasoning and sample efficiency, outperforming standard RL pipelines.

Conclusion: Deliberate exploration, using representation-based diversity, effectively uncovers new behaviors in language models, offering a practical way to enhance performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) promises to expand the capabilities of language
models, but it is unclear if current RL techniques promote the discovery of
novel behaviors, or simply sharpen those already present in the base model. In
this paper, we investigate the value of deliberate exploration -- explicitly
incentivizing the model to discover novel and diverse behaviors -- and aim to
understand how the knowledge in pre-trained models can guide this search. Our
main finding is that exploration with a simple, principled,
representation-based bonus derived from the pre-trained language model's hidden
states significantly improves diversity and pass@k rates -- both for
post-training, and in a novel inference-time scaling setting we introduce. For
inference-time, exploration with representation-based diversity improves
efficiency, consistently improving pass@k rates across a variety of models and
reasoning tasks. For example, for Qwen-2.5-14b-Instruct we obtain over 50%
improvement in verifier efficiency on almost all tasks. For post-training, we
show that integrating this exploration strategy into an RL pipeline improves
reasoning performance over that of the initial model and over standard RL
post-training. For example, on AIME 2024, our post-trained
Qwen-2.5-7b-Instruct's pass@80 matches the pass@256 of GRPO on the same model,
demonstrating a 3x improvement in test-time sample efficiency. Overall, our
findings suggest that deliberate exploration -- with the right notion of
diversity -- is a practical path toward discovery of new behaviors beyond
sharpening.

*Edward Stevinson,Lucas Prieto,Melih Barsbey,Tolga Birdal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper argues that adversarial vulnerability arises from efficient information encoding and superposition in neural networks, making attack patterns predictable based on feature arrangements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the fundamental origins of adversarial vulnerability in neural networks and offer an explanation beyond irregular decision landscapes or sensitivity to non-robust features.

Method: The authors investigate adversarial vulnerability through a theoretical framework centered on superposition, synthetic experiments, and validation using a Vision Transformer (ViT) trained on CIFAR-10.

Result: The study shows that superposition creates adversarial vulnerabilities, explains phenomena like attack transferability and class-specific vulnerability patterns, and provides consistent findings in both synthetic and real-world systems.

Conclusion: Adversarial vulnerability can arise from representational compression due to superposition in neural networks, rather than being solely a flaw in learning processes or input data characteristics.

Abstract: Fundamental questions remain about when and why adversarial examples arise in
neural networks, with competing views characterising them either as artifacts
of the irregularities in the decision landscape or as products of sensitivity
to non-robust input features. In this paper, we instead argue that adversarial
vulnerability can stem from efficient information encoding in neural networks.
Specifically, we show how superposition - where networks represent more
features than they have dimensions - creates arrangements of latent
representations that adversaries can exploit. We demonstrate that adversarial
perturbations leverage interference between superposed features, making attack
patterns predictable from feature arrangements. Our framework provides a
mechanistic explanation for two known phenomena: adversarial attack
transferability between models with similar training regimes and class-specific
vulnerability patterns. In synthetic settings with precisely controlled
superposition, we establish that superposition suffices to create adversarial
vulnerability. We then demonstrate that these findings persist in a ViT trained
on CIFAR-10. These findings reveal adversarial vulnerability can be a byproduct
of networks' representational compression, rather than flaws in the learning
process or non-robust inputs.

*Dinithi Jayasuriya,Divake Kumar,Sureshkumar Senthilkumar,Devashri Naik,Nastaran Darabi,Amit Ranjan Trivedi*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper proposes CaDRO, a framework combining causal discovery with dimensionality reduction, to optimize analog circuits more efficiently than traditional methods like NSGA-II.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing analog circuits is challenging due to high-dimensional parameter spaces, feedback couplings, and costly simulations. Existing evolutionary algorithms lack the ability to prioritize impactful parameters, leading to inefficiencies.

Method: The authors introduce CaDRO, which integrates causal discovery into the optimization pipeline. It creates a causal map to rank parameters based on their influence, focusing the optimization on significant variables while fixing less impactful ones.

Result: CaDRO significantly outperforms NSGA-II in convergence speed, with up to 10× faster optimization. It also improves solution quality, seen in metrics like hypervolume (e.g., 0.94 vs 0.56 for the Folded-Cascode Amplifier).

Conclusion: CaDRO provides a scalable and efficient approach to analog circuit design by selectively simplifying the search space. It enhances optimization without altering the core algorithm, making it both versatile and effective.

Abstract: Multi-objective optimization of analog circuits is hindered by
high-dimensional parameter spaces, strong feedback couplings, and expensive
transistor-level simulations. Evolutionary algorithms such as Non-dominated
Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) are widely used but treat all parameters
equally, thereby wasting effort on variables with little impact on performance,
which limits their scalability. We introduce CaDRO, a causal-guided
dimensionality reduction framework that embeds causal discovery into the
optimization pipeline. CaDRO builds a quantitative causal map through a hybrid
observational-interventional process, ranking parameters by their causal effect
on the objectives. Low-impact parameters are fixed to values from high-quality
solutions, while critical drivers remain active in the search. The reduced
design space enables focused evolutionary optimization without modifying the
underlying algorithm. Across amplifiers, regulators, and RF circuits, CaDRO
converges up to 10$\times$ faster than NSGA-II while preserving or improving
Pareto quality. For instance, on the Folded-Cascode Amplifier, hypervolume
improves from 0.56 to 0.94, and on the LDO regulator from 0.65 to 0.81, with
large gains in non-dominated solutions.

*Buqing Xu,Jianfeng Zhu,Yichi Zhang,Qinyi Cai,Guanhua Li,Shaojun Wei,Leibo Liu*

Main category: cs.PF

TL;DR: The paper introduces CAPSim, an ML-based CPU simulator using attention-based neural networks for faster and accurate simulation of unseen benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The simulation of modern multi-core CPUs is essential but challenging, with traditional methods like GEM5 being time-consuming due to their cycle-accurate, event-driven simulation of complex architectures.

Method: CAPSim employs an attention-based neural network performance predictor and a context-annotated instruction trace sampling technique, optimizing accuracy by focusing on critical code instructions.

Result: CAPSim achieves a 2.2–8.3x speedup in execution time prediction compared to a GEM5 O3 simulator on an Intel Xeon CPU, outperforming existing deep learning methods.

Conclusion: CAPSim offers a fast, efficient, and accurate alternative for CPU performance simulation, particularly advantageous for unseen benchmark prediction.

Abstract: CPU simulators are vital for computer architecture research, primarily for
estimating performance under different programs. This poses challenges for fast
and accurate simulation of modern CPUs, especially in multi-core systems.
Modern CPU peformance simulators such as GEM5 adopt the cycle-accurate and
event-driven approach, which is timeconsuming to simulate the extensive
microarchitectural behavior of a real benchmark running on out-of-order CPUs.
Recently, machine leaning based approach has been proposed to improve
simulation speed, but they are currently limited to estimating the cycles of
basic blocks rather than the complete benchmark program. This paper introduces
a novel ML-based CPU simulator named CAPSim, which uses an attention-based
neural network performance predictor and instruction trace sampling method
annotated with context. The attention mechanism effectively captures long-range
influence within the instruction trace, emphasizing critical context
information. This allows the model to improve performance prediction accuracy
by focusing on important code instruction. CAPSim can predict the execution
time of unseen benchmarks at a significantly fast speed compared with an
accurate O3 simulator built with gem5. Our evaluation on a commercial Intel
Xeon CPU demonstrates that CAPSim achieves a 2.2 - 8.3x speedup compared to
using gem5 built simulator, which is superior to the cutting-edge deep learning
approach

*Tilman Hinnerichs,Reuben Gardos Reid,Jaap de Jong,Bart Swinkels,Pamela Wochner,Nicolae Filat,Tudor Magurescu,Issa Hanou,Sebastijan Dumancic*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: Herb.jl is a Julia library designed for modular program synthesis, enabling easier reuse and remixing of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current program synthesis methods are effective but hard to reuse and adapt due to their monolithic implementations.

Method: Herb.jl modularizes synthesis algorithms into extendable, communicative components to allow for easy application and modification.

Result: The library demonstrates its utility through three use cases: solving a simple problem, replicating an existing synthesizer, and benchmarking a synthesizer.

Conclusion: Herb.jl provides a unified framework for program synthesis, simplifying the development and testing of synthesis methods.

Abstract: Program synthesis -- the automatic generation of code given a specification
-- is one of the most fundamental tasks in artificial intelligence (AI) and
many programmers' dream. Numerous synthesizers have been developed to tackle
program synthesis, manifesting different ideas to approach the exponentially
growing program space. While numerous smart program synthesis tools exist,
reusing and remixing previously developed methods is tedious and
time-consuming. We propose Herb.jl, a unifying program synthesis library
written in the Julia programming language, to address these issues. Since
current methods rely on similar building blocks, we aim to modularize the
underlying synthesis algorithm into communicating and fully extendable
sub-compartments, allowing for straightforward reapplication of these modules.
To demonstrate the benefits of using Herb.jl, we show three common use cases:
1. how to implement a simple problem and grammar, and how to solve it, 2. how
to implement a previously developed synthesizer with just a few lines of code,
and 3. how to run a synthesizer against a benchmark.

### [705] [ACT: Automatically Generating Compiler Backends from Tensor Accelerator ISA Descriptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09932)
*Devansh Jain,Akash Pardeshi,Marco Frigo,Krut Patel,Kaustubh Khulbe,Jai Arora,Charith Mendis*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ACT, a system for automatically generating compiler backends for tensor accelerators, addressing the lack of backend support in these rapidly iterating designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Currently, tensor accelerators lack efficient compiler backends due to their fast design iterations, which hampers software development and adoption compared to commodity hardware platforms.

Method: ACT introduces formal specifications for tensor accelerator ISAs and combines novel techniques like parameterized equality saturation for instruction selection and constraint programming for memory allocation.

Result: ACT generated backends for three tensor accelerators, showing performance parity or superiority compared to hand-optimized libraries, with low compilation overheads.

Conclusion: ACT streamlines backend creation for tensor accelerators, enabling faster development and adoption while proving its correctness and effectiveness.

Abstract: Tensor compilers play a key role in enabling high-performance implementations
of deep learning workloads. These compilers rely on existing CPU and GPU code
generation backends to generate device-specific code. Recently, many tensor
accelerators (neural processing units) have been proposed to further accelerate
these workloads. Compared to commodity hardware, however, most of the proposed
tensor accelerators do not have compiler backends with code generation support.
Moreover, the accelerator designs are subject to fast iteration cycles, making
it difficult to manually develop compiler backends similar to commodity
hardware platforms. Therefore, to increase adoption and enable faster software
development cycles for novel tensor accelerator designs, we need to make the
compiler backend construction process more agile.
  To address this gap, we introduce ACT, a compiler backend generator that
automatically generates compiler backends for tensor accelerators, given just
the instruction set architecture (ISA) descriptions. We first formally specify
the compiler backend generation problem that introduces a novel specification
for describing tensor accelerator ISAs. Next, we design ACT such that it
supports user-programmable memories and complex parameterized instructions that
are prevalent in tensor accelerators. ACT uses a novel parameterized equality
saturation-based instruction selection phase and a constraint programming-based
memory allocation phase. We prove that compiler backends generated by ACT are
sound and complete. Finally, we generate compiler backends for three
accelerator platforms from industry and academia, and show that they match or
outperform code written using hand-optimized kernel libraries while maintaining
low compilation overheads.

### [706] [End-to-end Compositional Verification of Program Safety through Verified and Verifying Compilation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10015)
*Jinhua Wu,Yuting Wang,Liukun Yu,Linglong Meng*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'open safety', a modular and generic safety concept, to ensure end-to-end program safety when compiling programs mixing safe and unsafe modules. This approach is demonstrated using a verified compiler for a Rust-like language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring end-to-end program safety is challenging in modern programming, especially with languages like Rust that require mixing safe and unsafe code. Traditional methods don't adequately support this modular safety notion.

Method: The authors propose 'open safety', defined using open labeled transition systems (LTS), to achieve compositional safety verification for heterogeneous modules. A verified compiler for 'Owlang', inspired by Rust, was developed to demonstrate the approach.

Result: Open safety successfully enables modular preservation of safety across mixed safe and unsafe modules. A practical evaluation using a hash map implemented in Owlang and C validated compositional safety.

Conclusion: The framework addresses the challenge of modular end-to-end safety preservation in modern systems, enabling effective cooperation between verified and verifying compilation.

Abstract: Program safety (i.e., absence of undefined behaviors) is critical for correct
operation of computer systems. It is usually verified at the source level
(e.g., by separation logics) and preserved to the target by verified compilers
(e.g., CompCert), thereby achieving end-to-end verification of safety. However,
modern safe programming languages like Rust pose new problems in achieving
end-to-end safety. Because not all functionalities can be implemented in the
safe language, mixing safe and unsafe modules is needed. Therefore, verified
compilation must preserve a modular notion of safety which can be composed at
the target level. Furthermore, certain classes of errors (e.g., memory errors)
are automatically excluded by verifying compilation (e.g., borrow checking) for
modules written in safe languages. As a result, verified compilation needs to
cooperate with verifying compilation to ensure end-to-end safety.
  To address the above problems, we propose a modular and generic definition of
safety called open safety based on program semantics described as open labeled
transition systems (LTS). Open safety is composable at the boundary of modules
and can be modularly preserved by verified compositional compilation. Those
properties enable separate verification of safety for heterogeneous modules and
composition of the safety results at the target level. Open safety can be
generalized to partial safety (i.e., only a certain class of errors can occur).
By this we formalized the correctness of verifying compilation as derivation of
total safety from partial safety. We demonstrate how our framework can combine
verified and verifying compilation by developing a verified compiler for an
ownership language (called Owlang) inspired by Rust. We evaluate our approach
on the compositional safety verification using a hash map implemented by Owlang
and C.

*Massinissa Merouani,Afif Boudaoud,Riyadh Baghdadi*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LOOPerSet, a dataset with 28 million labeled data points from 220,000 polyhedral programs for advancing data-driven compiler optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current research in machine learning for optimizing compilers suffers from a lack of large-scale performance datasets, creating barriers to innovation and reproducibility.

Method: The authors synthetically generated 220,000 polyhedral programs and labeled 28 million data points with execution time metrics corresponding to semantics-preserving program transformations.

Result: LOOPerSet offers significant diversity and scale, enabling training cost models, benchmarking architectures, and advancing automated polyhedral scheduling.

Conclusion: By releasing LOOPerSet with a permissive license, the authors aim to foster reproducible research and accelerate progress in data-driven compiler optimizations.

Abstract: The advancement of machine learning for compiler optimization, particularly
within the polyhedral model, is constrained by the scarcity of large-scale,
public performance datasets. This data bottleneck forces researchers to
undertake costly data generation campaigns, slowing down innovation and
hindering reproducible research learned code optimization. To address this gap,
we introduce LOOPerSet, a new public dataset containing 28 million labeled data
points derived from 220,000 unique, synthetically generated polyhedral
programs. Each data point maps a program and a complex sequence of
semantics-preserving transformations (such as fusion, skewing, tiling, and
parallelism)to a ground truth performance measurement (execution time). The
scale and diversity of LOOPerSet make it a valuable resource for training and
evaluating learned cost models, benchmarking new model architectures, and
exploring the frontiers of automated polyhedral scheduling. The dataset is
released under a permissive license to foster reproducible research and lower
the barrier to entry for data-driven compiler optimization.

### [708] [Learning to Guarantee Type Correctness in Code Generation through Type-Guided Program Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10216)
*Zhechong Huang,Zhao Zhang,Ruyi Ji,Tingxuan Xia,Qihao Zhu,Qinxiang Cao,Zeyu Sun,Yingfei Xiong*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: TyFlow introduces a system that internalizes type reasoning and uses type-guided program synthesis to ensure type-correctness in code generation by language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models struggle with type correctness in code generation, as externally rejecting untypable code does not lead to internal learning of type reasoning.

Method: TyFlow utilizes a type-guided program synthesis system that aligns type derivation trees with synthesis derivation trees, creating a novel code representation based on synthesis decision sequences.

Result: Evaluation shows TyFlow eliminates type errors and enhances functional correctness in code generation.

Conclusion: Integrating type systems into code generation models significantly benefits both type correctness and functional accuracy, demonstrating the potential of internalized type reasoning approaches like TyFlow.

Abstract: Language models have shown remarkable proficiency in code generation;
nevertheless, ensuring type correctness remains a challenge. Although
traditional methods, such as constrained decoding, alleviate this problem by
externally rejecting untypable code, the model itself does not effectively
learn type reasoning internally, which ultimately limits its overall
performance. This paper introduces TyFlow, a novel system that internalizes
type reasoning within code generation to guide the model to learn the type
system. The core of our approach is a novel type-guided program synthesis
system that maintains an isomorphism between type derivation trees and
synthesis derivation trees, enabling a new code representation based on
synthesis decision sequences rather than traditional text-based token
sequences. By offloading the complexity of type system learning to the
representation itself, models can redirect their computational resources toward
higher-level program semantics. Our evaluation shows that TyFlow not only
eliminates type errors but also significantly improves functional correctness,
highlighting the importance of aligning LMs with type systems internally.

### [709] [Old is Gold: Optimizing Single-threaded Applications with Exgen-Malloc](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10219)
*Ruihao Li,Lizy K. John,Neeraja J. Yadwadkar*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: Exgen-Malloc is a memory allocator tailored for single-threaded applications, optimizing performance and memory efficiency by simplifying metadata and control flow.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Memory allocators, despite their small code size, significantly impact datacenter efficiency. Optimizations can translate to substantial cost and energy savings, especially in hyperscale settings.

Method: Exgen-Malloc targets single-threaded applications, eliminating unnecessary metadata and simplifying control flow. It uses a centralized heap, a single free-block list, and a balanced memory management approach, integrating principles from modern multi-threaded allocators.

Result: Exgen-Malloc demonstrates speed improvements of up to 1.93x and memory savings of 25.2% in benchmarks compared to legacy allocators like dlmalloc and modern allocators like mimalloc.

Conclusion: Exgen-Malloc exemplifies how tailored, specialized designs can significantly improve allocator efficiency and reduce overhead in single-threaded environments.

Abstract: Memory allocators hide beneath nearly every application stack, yet their
performance footprint extends far beyond their code size. Even small
inefficiencies in the allocators ripple through caches and the rest of the
memory hierarchy, collectively imposing what operators often call a "datacenter
tax". At hyperscale, even a 1% improvement in allocator efficiency can unlock
millions of dollars in savings and measurable reductions in datacenter energy
consumption. Modern memory allocators are designed to optimize allocation speed
and memory fragmentation in multi-threaded environments, relying on complex
metadata and control logic to achieve high performance. However, the overhead
introduced by this complexity prompts a reevaluation of allocator design.
Notably, such overhead can be avoided in single-threaded scenarios, which
continue to be widely used across diverse application domains.
  In this paper, we introduce Exgen-Malloc, a memory allocator purpose-built
for single-threaded applications. By specializing for single-threaded
execution, Exgen-Malloc eliminates unnecessary metadata, simplifies the control
flow, thereby reducing overhead and improving allocation efficiency. Its core
design features include a centralized heap, a single free-block list, and a
balanced strategy for memory commitment and relocation. Additionally,
Exgen-Malloc incorporates design principles in modern multi-threaded
allocators, which do not exist in legacy single-threaded allocators such as
dlmalloc. We evaluate Exgen-Malloc on two Intel Xeon platforms. Across both
systems, Exgen-Malloc achieves a speedup of 1.17x, 1.10x, and 1.93x over
dlmalloc on SPEC CPU2017, redis-benchmark, and mimalloc-bench, respectively. In
addition to performance, Exgen-Malloc achieves 6.2%, 0.1%, and 25.2% memory
savings over mimalloc on SPEC CPU2017, redis-benchmark, and mimalloc-bench,
respectively.

*Hui Xu*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: This paper establishes a framework for understanding unsafe code in Rust and provides guidelines for sound encapsulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsafe code in Rust is a critical concern despite its memory safety guarantees, necessitating a deeper understanding.

Method: The paper combines a review of Rust's safety design and an analysis of real-world Rust projects to systematically understand unsafe code and undefined behavior.

Result: A framework for unsafe code and criteria for soundness in Rust code are summarized.

Conclusion: Actionable guidance for achieving sound encapsulation in Rust is derived, contributing to safer programming practices.

Abstract: Rust is a memory-safe programming language that disallows undefined behavior.
Its safety guarantees have been extensively examined by the community through
empirical studies, which has led to its remarkable success. However, unsafe
code remains a critical concern in Rust. By reviewing the safety design of Rust
and analyzing real-world Rust projects, this paper establishes a systematic
framework for understanding unsafe code and undefined behavior, and summarizes
the soundness criteria for Rust code. It further derives actionable guidance
for achieving sound encapsulation.

### [711] [ECO: Enhanced Code Optimization via Performance-Aware Prompting for Code-LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10517)
*Su-Hyeon Kim,Joonghyuk Hahn,Sooyoung Cha,Yo-Sub Han*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ECO, a framework designed to optimize code logic for faster execution by addressing inefficiencies and providing performance-aware prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Code optimization is complicated by the need to consider structural and algorithmic trade-offs, and existing methods often fail to identify causal factors driving performance improvements.

Method: ECO employs runtime optimization instructions (ROIs), symbolic bottleneck diagnosis, and ROI retrieval, combining them into performance-aware prompts for code models.

Result: Empirical evidence shows ECO-enhanced prompts improve code efficiency significantly, achieving up to 7.81x better runtimes with minimal errors.

Conclusion: ECO offers a model-agnostic and easily adoptable approach for improving code-LLMs' optimization capabilities through performance-aware guidance.

Abstract: Code runtime optimization-the task of rewriting a given code to a faster
one-remains challenging, as it requires reasoning about performance trade-offs
involving algorithmic and structural choices. Recent approaches employ
code-LLMs with slow-fast code pairs provided as optimization guidance, but such
pair-based methods obscure the causal factors of performance gains and often
lead to superficial pattern imitation rather than genuine performance
reasoning. We introduce ECO, a performance-aware prompting framework for code
optimization. ECO first distills runtime optimization instructions (ROIs) from
reference slow-fast code pairs; Each ROI describes root causes of inefficiency
and the rationales that drive performance improvements. For a given input code,
ECO in parallel employs (i) a symbolic advisor to produce a bottleneck
diagnosis tailored to the code, and (ii) an ROI retriever to return related
ROIs. These two outputs are then composed into a performance-aware prompt,
providing actionable guidance for code-LLMs. ECO's prompts are model-agnostic,
require no fine-tuning, and can be easily prepended to any code-LLM prompt. Our
empirical studies highlight that ECO prompting significantly improves
code-LLMs' ability to generate efficient code, achieving speedups of up to
7.81x while minimizing correctness loss.

*Guillaume Ambal,George Hodgkins,Mark Madler,Gregory Chockler,Brijesh Dongol,Joseph Izraelevitz,Azalea Raad,Viktor Vafeiadis*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LOCO, a library designed for building multi-node objects with RDMA, and Mowgli, a verification framework for ensuring correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in utilizing RDMA by bridging the gap between shared memory and distributed programming with a simpler, formally verified solution.

Method: Developed LOCO, a library for RDMA-based objects, and Mowgli, a modular verification framework compatible with different memory models.

Result: LOCO provides encapsulated multi-node objects with strong performance, while formal correctness is verified through Mowgli.

Conclusion: The work simplifies RDMA programming with LOCO and formal verification via Mowgli, maintaining performance while ensuring correctness.

Abstract: Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) is a memory technology that allows remote
devices to directly write to and read from each other's memory, bypassing
components such as the CPU and operating system. This enables low-latency
high-throughput networking, as required for many modern data centres, HPC
applications and AI/ML workloads. However, baseline RDMA comprises a highly
permissive weak memory model that is difficult to use in practice and has only
recently been formalised. In this paper, we introduce the Library of Composable
Objects (LOCO), a formally verified library for building multi-node objects on
RDMA, filling the gap between shared memory and distributed system programming.
LOCO objects are well-encapsulated and take advantage of the strong locality
and the weak consistency characteristics of RDMA. They have performance
comparable to custom RDMA systems (e.g. distributed maps), but with a far
simpler programming model amenable to formal proofs of correctness. To support
verification, we develop a novel modular declarative verification framework,
called Mowgli, that is flexible enough to model multinode objects and is
independent of a memory consistency model. We instantiate Mowgli with the RDMA
memory model, and use it to verify correctness of LOCO libraries.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a string-interval abstract domain leveraging word equations and disequalities for program analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the analysis of JavaScript string-manipulating programs by introducing a precise and efficient abstract domain.

Method: The authors employed a lattice structure of string intervals and utilized a reduced product approach on a string property semilattice with specific morphisms. Reduction strategies were applied to maintain the lattice structure.

Result: Defined abstract string operations aim to be computationally efficient and applicable to JavaScript string program analysis.

Conclusion: The string-interval abstract domain provides an effective framework for analyzing properties of JavaScript string manipulation programs, optimizing computation.

Abstract: We introduce a string-interval abstract domain, where string intervals are
characterized by systems of word equations (encoding lower bounds on string
values) and word disequalities (encoding upper bounds). Building upon the
lattice structure of string intervals, we define an abstract string object as a
reduced product on a string property semilattice, determined by
length-non-increasing morphisms. We consider several reduction strategies for
abstract string objects and show that upon these strategies the string object
domain forms a lattice. We define basic abstract string operations on the
domain, aiming to minimize computational overheads on the reduction, and show
how the domain can be used to analyse properties of JavaScript string
manipulating programs.

TL;DR: HUGR introduces a new graph-based intermediate representation for mixed quantum-classical programs, focusing on extensibility, expressivity, safety guarantees, and machine-friendliness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for an intermediate representation that can capture the complexity of near-term and future quantum computing devices, as well as evolving quantum programming paradigms.

Method: HUGR uses a hierarchical, extensible, and machine-friendly graph-based design, inspired by MLIR, with built-in safety features such as strict, static typing and linear quantum types.

Result: The paper provides an open-source specification and reference implementation of HUGR, showcasing its capabilities for handling mixed quantum-classical programming and supporting compilation tooling.

Conclusion: HUGR enables efficient and safe compilation for quantum programs at multiple abstraction levels, facilitating the development of tooling and support for advanced quantum computing paradigms.

Abstract: We introduce the Hierarchical Unified Graph Representation (HUGR): a novel
graph based intermediate representation for mixed quantum-classical programs.
HUGR's design features high expressivity and extensibility to capture the
capabilities of near-term and forthcoming quantum computing devices, as well as
new and evolving abstractions from novel quantum programming paradigms. The
graph based structure is machine-friendly and supports powerful pattern
matching based compilation techniques. Inspired by MLIR, HUGR's extensibility
further allows compilation tooling to reason about programs at multiple levels
of abstraction, lowering smoothly between them. Safety guarantees in the
structure including strict, static typing and linear quantum types allow rapid
development of compilation tooling without fear of program invalidation. A full
specification of HUGR and reference implementation are open-source and
available online.

### [715] [(Dis)Proving Spectre Security with Speculation-Passing Style](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11573)
*Santiago Arranz-Olmos,Gilles Barthe,Lionel Blatter,Xingyu Xie,Zhiyuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel methodology (Speculation-Passing Style, SPS) to adapt constant-time (CT) verification tools for detecting speculative constant-time (SCT) vulnerabilities by formalizing the lifting process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of formal foundations in lifting CT verification tools for SCT vulnerability detection and demonstrate practical benefits.

Method: Develop a program transformation called Speculation-Passing Style (SPS) that modifies the program to follow attacker-controlled predictions, allowing SCT verification to be reduced to CT verification.

Result: Demonstrated that SPS is sound and complete for SCT detection by adapting CT verification methods using three tools (EasyCrypt, BINSEC, ctgrind) and evaluating them on Kocher's Spectre-v1 benchmarks.

Conclusion: The SPS approach enables leveraging existing CT tools for SCT verification, with potential extensions to other Spectre variants and leakage models.

Abstract: Constant-time (CT) verification tools are commonly used for detecting
potential side-channel vulnerabilities in cryptographic libraries. Recently, a
new class of tools, called speculative constant-time (SCT) tools, has also been
used for detecting potential Spectre vulnerabilities. In many cases, these SCT
tools have emerged as liftings of CT tools. However, these liftings are seldom
defined precisely and are almost never analyzed formally. The goal of this
paper is to address this gap, by developing formal foundations for these
liftings, and to demonstrate that these foundations can yield practical
benefits.
  Concretely, we introduce a program transformation, coined Speculation-Passing
Style (SPS), for reducing SCT verification to CT verification. Essentially, the
transformation instruments the program with a new input that corresponds to
attacker-controlled predictions and modifies the program to follow them. This
approach is sound and complete, in the sense that a program is SCT if and only
if its SPS transform is CT. Thus, we can leverage existing CT verification
tools to prove SCT; we illustrate this by combining SPS with three standard
methodologies for CT verification, namely reducing it to non-interference,
assertion safety and dynamic taint analysis. We realize these combinations with
three existing tools, EasyCrypt, BINSEC, and ctgrind, and we evaluate them on
Kocher's benchmarks for Spectre-v1. Our results focus on Spectre-v1 in the
standard CT leakage model; however, we also discuss applications of our method
to other variants of Spectre and other leakage models.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CFG-DP significantly improves humanoid robots' performance in sequential tasks by integrating Classifier-Free Guidance for better temporal coherence and action accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like DP and ACT often fail in sequential tasks for humanoid robots due to limited temporal context, leading to inefficiencies and repetitive actions.

Method: The paper proposes CFG-DP, which combines Diffusion Policy with Classifier-Free Guidance using conditional and unconditional models with dynamic timestep-based adjustments.

Result: Experiments with real-world humanoid robots indicated high success rates and reduced repetitive actions during sequential tasks.

Conclusion: CFG-DP enhances deterministic control and execution reliability, making it a robust framework for sequential robotic tasks.

Abstract: Temporal sequential tasks challenge humanoid robots, as existing Diffusion
Policy (DP) and Action Chunking with Transformers (ACT) methods often lack
temporal context, resulting in local optima traps and excessive repetitive
actions. To address these issues, this paper introduces a Classifier-Free
Guidance-Based Diffusion Policy (CFG-DP), a novel framework to enhance DP by
integrating Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) with conditional and unconditional
models. Specifically, CFG leverages timestep inputs to track task progression
and ensure precise cycle termination. It dynamically adjusts action predictions
based on task phase, using a guidance factor tuned to balance temporal
coherence and action accuracy. Real-world experiments on a humanoid robot
demonstrate high success rates and minimal repetitive actions. Furthermore, we
assessed the model's ability to terminate actions and examined how different
components and parameter adjustments affect its performance. This framework
significantly enhances deterministic control and execution reliability for
sequential robotic tasks.

TL;DR: The paper presents two methods, Touch2Touch and T2D2, for generating cross-sensor tactile images, enabling the use of visuo-tactile models across different sensors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing general-purpose tactile representations is challenging due to models being specific to certain sensor designs. This research aims to address this limitation.

Method: Two methods are proposed: Touch2Touch for paired data and T2D2 for building intermediate depth representations without needing paired data.

Result: The study demonstrates the effectiveness of these methods in tasks such as in-hand pose estimation and behavior cloning, allowing models to transfer between different sensors.

Conclusion: The proposed frameworks offer flexible and effective solutions for cross-sensor tactile data generation, meeting diverse application needs and data constraints.

Abstract: Today's visuo-tactile sensors come in many shapes and sizes, making it
challenging to develop general-purpose tactile representations. This is because
most models are tied to a specific sensor design. To address this challenge, we
propose two approaches to cross-sensor image generation. The first is an
end-to-end method that leverages paired data (Touch2Touch). The second method
builds an intermediate depth representation and does not require paired data
(T2D2: Touch-to-Depth-to-Touch). Both methods enable the use of sensor-specific
models across multiple sensors via the cross-sensor touch generation process.
Together, these models offer flexible solutions for sensor translation,
depending on data availability and application needs. We demonstrate their
effectiveness on downstream tasks such as in-hand pose estimation and behavior
cloning, successfully transferring models trained on one sensor to another.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to accurately and promptly update maps in environments where robots operate repeatedly to avoid issues like poor localization and inefficient operations.

Method: The system uses a hybrid 3D representation with TSDF-based voxel maps for detecting changes, and a variation-aware density control strategy to manage Gaussian primitives in regions with changes.

Result: Experiments prove that VG-Mapping improves both rendering quality and map update efficiency in semi-static scenes.

Conclusion: VG-Mapping effectively and efficiently updates maps in semi-static environments, making it a reliable tool for robotic operations. A benchmark dataset is also provided.

Abstract: Maintaining an up-to-date map that accurately reflects recent changes in the
environment is crucial, especially for robots that repeatedly traverse the same
space. Failing to promptly update the changed regions can degrade map quality,
resulting in poor localization, inefficient operations, and even lost robots.
3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently seen widespread adoption in online
map reconstruction due to its dense, differentiable, and photorealistic
properties, yet accurately and efficiently updating the regions of change
remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose VG-Mapping, a novel online
3DGS-based mapping system tailored for such semi-static scenes. Our approach
introduces a hybrid representation that augments 3DGS with a TSDF-based voxel
map to efficiently identify changed regions in a scene, along with a
variation-aware density control strategy that inserts or deletes Gaussian
primitives in regions undergoing change. Furthermore, to address the absence of
public benchmarks for this task, we construct a RGB-D dataset comprising both
synthetic and real-world semi-static environments. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method substantially improves the rendering quality and
map update efficiency in semi-static scenes. The code and dataset are available

### [719] [LLM-HBT: Dynamic Behavior Tree Construction for Adaptive Coordination in Heterogeneous Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09963)
*Chaoran Wang,Jingyuan Sun,Yanhui Zhang,Mingyu Zhang,Changju Wu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for creating dynamic behavior trees (BTs) in multi-robot systems using large language models (LLMs) to improve adaptability and robustness in challenging scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional robots struggle to adapt to task failures and dynamically changing environments due to their fixed functional attributes.

Method: The framework integrates LLMs for dynamic BT generation with modules for task initialization, task assignment, BT updates, and failure node detection. This allows robots to adapt locally or through a centralized virtual coordinator.

Result: The framework was validated on 60 tasks across simulated and real-world environments, outperforming baselines in terms of task success rate, robustness, and scalability.

Conclusion: The proposed system effectively enhances multi-robot collaboration in complex and dynamic environments, leveraging LLMs and BTs for robustness and adaptability.

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for automatic behavior tree (BT) construction
in heterogeneous multi-robot systems, designed to address the challenges of
adaptability and robustness in dynamic environments. Traditional robots are
limited by fixed functional attributes and cannot efficiently reconfigure their
strategies in response to task failures or environmental changes. To overcome
this limitation, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate and
extend BTs dynamically, combining the reasoning and generalization power of
LLMs with the modularity and recovery capability of BTs. The proposed framework
consists of four interconnected modules task initialization, task assignment,
BT update, and failure node detection which operate in a closed loop. Robots
tick their BTs during execution, and upon encountering a failure node, they can
either extend the tree locally or invoke a centralized virtual coordinator
(Alex) to reassign subtasks and synchronize BTs across peers. This design
enables long-term cooperative execution in heterogeneous teams. We validate the
framework on 60 tasks across three simulated scenarios and in a real-world cafe
environment with a robotic arm and a wheeled-legged robot. Results show that
our method consistently outperforms baseline approaches in task success rate,
robustness, and scalability, demonstrating its effectiveness for multi-robot
collaboration in complex scenarios.

### [720] [FORM: Fixed-Lag Odometry with Reparative Mapping utilizing Rotating LiDAR Sensors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09966)
*Easton R. Potokar,Taylor Pool,Daniel McGann,Michael Kaess*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces FORM, a real-time LiDAR Odometry (LO) method that actively refines local maps and achieves smooth trajectory estimates, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most LO methods rely on submaps that propagate pose estimation errors, leading to degraded performance and jittery trajectories. The paper aims to address these shortcomings.

Method: The proposed method, FORM, utilizes a fixed-lag smoothing approach with a densely connected factor graph and a single iterative map for real-time matching and map correction.

Result: FORM demonstrates robustness, accuracy, and smooth trajectory estimates across various datasets, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: FORM successfully combines real-time processing with reparative mapping, providing superior performance and trajectory smoothness for LiDAR Odometry tasks.

Abstract: Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors have become a de-facto sensor for
many robot state estimation tasks, spurring development of many LiDAR Odometry
(LO) methods in recent years. While some smoothing-based LO methods have been
proposed, most require matching against multiple scans, resulting in
sub-real-time performance. Due to this, most prior works estimate a single
state at a time and are ``submap''-based. This architecture propagates any
error in pose estimation to the fixed submap and can cause jittery trajectories
and degrade future registrations. We propose Fixed-Lag Odometry with Reparative
Mapping (FORM), a LO method that performs smoothing over a densely connected
factor graph while utilizing a single iterative map for matching. This allows
for both real-time performance and active correction of the local map as pose
estimates are further refined. We evaluate on a wide variety of datasets to
show that FORM is robust, accurate, real-time, and provides smooth trajectory
estimates when compared to prior state-of-the-art LO methods.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces ATRos, a reinforcement learning framework for wheeled-legged robots to coordinate wheel and leg movements for hybrid locomotion across various terrains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wheeled-legged robots combine leg agility and wheel efficiency, but achieving effective control in hybrid locomotion remains a challenge.

Method: The framework uses reinforcement learning with a prediction policy network to estimate environmental states and an actor-critic network to generate optimal joint commands for robot movements.

Result: Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrated the system's adaptability and efficiency across diverse terrains, including flat ground, stairs, and grasses.

Conclusion: The proposed RL-based hybrid locomotion framework exhibits strong generalization and robust performance on unseen terrains, showcasing its feasibility for diverse applications.

Abstract: Hybrid locomotion of wheeled-legged robots has recently attracted increasing
attention due to their advantages of combining the agility of legged locomotion
and the efficiency of wheeled motion. But along with expanded performance, the
whole-body control of wheeled-legged robots remains challenging for hybrid
locomotion. In this paper, we present ATRos, a reinforcement learning
(RL)-based hybrid locomotion framework to achieve hybrid walking-driving
motions on the wheeled-legged robot. Without giving predefined gait patterns,
our planner aims to intelligently coordinate simultaneous wheel and leg
movements, thereby achieving improved terrain adaptability and improved energy
efficiency. Based on RL techniques, our approach constructs a prediction policy
network that could estimate external environmental states from proprioceptive
sensory information, and the outputs are then fed into an actor critic network
to produce optimal joint commands. The feasibility of the proposed framework is
validated through both simulations and real-world experiments across diverse
terrains, including flat ground, stairs, and grassy surfaces. The hybrid
locomotion framework shows robust performance over various unseen terrains,
highlighting its generalization capability.

*Shahid Ansari,Vivek Gupta,Bishakh Bhattacharya*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a soft-rigid hybrid robotic gripper for tomato harvesting designed to enhance efficiency and reduce crop damage through innovative auxetic lattice orientations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses inefficiencies and post-harvest losses in manual fruit and vegetable handling within agriculture by investigating automation through soft robotics.

Method: Introduced a hybrid gripper with a soft auxetic lattice and a six-finger 3D caging-effect design, experimentally validating auxetic lattice orientations using 2D Digital Image Correlation (DIC) and nonlinear finite element analysis (FEA).

Result: Auxetic lattice orientation significantly affects compliance, contact forces, and energy efficiency, with the study systematically comparing inclinations of 0°, 30°, 45°, and 60°.

Conclusion: The tailored auxetic geometries optimize robotic gripper performance, providing valuable insights for precision agriculture automation with minimized crop damage.

Abstract: The agricultural sector is rapidly evolving to meet growing global food
demands, yet tasks like fruit and vegetable handling remain labor-intensive,
causing inefficiencies and post-harvest losses. Automation, particularly
selective harvesting, offers a viable solution, with soft robotics emerging as
a key enabler. This study introduces a novel hybrid gripper for tomato
harvesting, incorporating a rigid outer frame with a soft auxetic internal
lattice. The six-finger, 3D caging-effect design enables gentle yet secure
grasping in unstructured environments. Uniquely, the work investigates the
effect of auxetic lattice orientation on grasping conformability, combining
experimental validation with 2D Digital Image Correlation (DIC) and nonlinear
finite element analysis (FEA). Auxetic configurations with unit cell
inclinations of 0 deg, 30 deg, 45 deg, and 60 deg are evaluated, and their
grasping forces, deformation responses, and motor torque requirements are
systematically compared. Results demonstrate that lattice orientation strongly
influences compliance, contact forces, and energy efficiency, with distinct
advantages across configurations. This comparative framework highlights the
novelty of tailoring auxetic geometries to optimize robotic gripper
performance. The findings provide new insights into soft-rigid hybrid gripper
design, advancing automation strategies for precision agriculture while
minimizing crop damage.

*Mingke Lu,Shuaikang Wang,Meng Guo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces LOMORO, an online coordination system for fleets of autonomous robots tasked with monitoring dynamic targets, addressing resource constraints and unpredictable conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve efficiency and reliability in monitoring dynamic targets using fleets of robots, addressing challenges like limited perception, unknown target behaviors, and resource constraints.

Method: The method involves a coordination scheme with three core components: modeling the multi-robot task assignment, a resource-aware task coordination algorithm, and an online adaptation mechanism.

Result: LOMORO demonstrated effectiveness in simulations by ensuring upper-bounded monitoring intervals and lower-bounded resource levels, while minimizing active robots compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed system enhances collaborative robotic monitoring by ensuring target coverage and resource adequacy, while optimizing robot utilization.

Abstract: Long-term monitoring of numerous dynamic targets can be tedious for a human
operator and infeasible for a single robot, e.g., to monitor wild flocks,
detect intruders, search and rescue. Fleets of autonomous robots can be
effective by acting collaboratively and concurrently. However, the online
coordination is challenging due to the unknown behaviors of the targets and the
limited perception of each robot. Existing work often deploys all robots
available without minimizing the fleet size, or neglects the constraints on
their resources such as battery and memory. This work proposes an online
coordination scheme called LOMORO for collaborative target monitoring, path
routing and resource charging. It includes three core components: (I) the
modeling of multi-robot task assignment problem under the constraints on
resources and monitoring intervals; (II) the resource-aware task coordination
algorithm iterates between the high-level assignment of dynamic targets and the
low-level multi-objective routing via the Martin's algorithm; (III) the online
adaptation algorithm in case of unpredictable target behaviors and robot
failures. It ensures the explicitly upper-bounded monitoring intervals for all
targets and the lower-bounded resource levels for all robots, while minimizing
the average number of active robots. The proposed methods are validated
extensively via large-scale simulations against several baselines, under
different road networks, robot velocities, charging rates and monitoring
intervals.

*Keidai Iiyama,Grace Gao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This study examines errors caused by ionospheric and plasmaspheric delays in exploiting terrestrial GNSS signals for lunar navigation, using simulations to quantify impacts on signal propagation and accuracy under varying conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With lunar exploration advancing, there's a need for accurate positioning, navigation, and timing systems on the Moon. This paper addresses the significant error source from ionospheric and plasmaspheric delays while utilizing terrestrial GNSS for lunar navigation.

Method: The study leverages the Global Core Plasma Model (GCPM) alongside a custom ray-tracing algorithm to analyze GNSS signal distortions. Simulations assess group delays up to the third order and excess path length caused by signal bending under various solar and geomagnetic conditions.

Result: Findings reveal that group delays can average around 1m but may exceed 100m during high solar activity for low-altitude paths. Bending delays are smaller yet notable for such paths. Signal frequency, geomagnetic $K_p$, and solar R12 index were found to impact delay magnitudes.

Conclusion: This research provides insights into mitigating errors from ionospheric and plasmaspheric influences, aiding the development of robust lunar GNSS-based navigation and timing algorithms.

Abstract: Recent advancements in lunar positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) have
demonstrated that terrestrial GNSS signals, including weak sidelobe
transmissions, can be exploited for lunar spacecraft positioning and timing.
While GNSS-based navigation at the Moon has been validated recently, unmodeled
ionospheric and plasmaspheric delays remain a significant error source,
particularly given the unique signal geometry and extended propagation paths.
This paper characterizes these delays using the Global Core Plasma Model (GCPM)
and a custom low-cost ray-tracing algorithm that iteratively solves for bent
signal paths. We simulate first-, second-, and third-order group delays, as
well as excess path length from ray bending, for GNSS signals received at both
lunar orbit and the lunar south pole under varying solar and geomagnetic
conditions. Results show that mean group delays are typically on the order of 1
m, but can exceed 100 m for low-altitude ray paths during high solar activity,
while bending delays are generally smaller but non-negligible for low-altitude
ray paths. We also quantify the influence of signal frequency, geomagnetic
$K_p$ index, and solar R12 index. These findings inform the design of robust
positioning and timing algorithms that utilize terrestrial GNSS signals.

*Feifei Liu,Haozhe Wang,Zejun Wei,Qirong Lu,Yiyang Wen,Xiaoyu Tang,Jingyan Jiang,Zhijian He*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper critiques current metrics for evaluating autonomous driving prediction models and introduces a new framework focusing on nuanced, scenario-aware performance evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current simplistic metrics like ADE and FDE fail to adequately assess prediction models in complex driving scenarios, leading to a gap in identifying model vulnerabilities and failure-prone cases.

Method: The authors propose a novel testing framework that evaluates prediction models by factoring in diverse scene structures, such as map context, agent density, proximity, and spatial distribution.

Result: Empirical analysis revealed that agent proximity significantly impacts prediction accuracy and exposed failure cases that traditional metrics overlook.

Conclusion: The proposed framework emphasizes scenario-aware evaluation to identify vulnerabilities in current models and serves as a basis for building robust and certifiable prediction systems for autonomous vehicles.

Abstract: Current evaluation methods for autonomous driving prediction models rely
heavily on simplistic metrics such as Average Displacement Error (ADE) and
Final Displacement Error (FDE). While these metrics offer basic performance
assessments, they fail to capture the nuanced behavior of prediction modules
under complex, interactive, and safety-critical driving scenarios. For
instance, existing benchmarks do not distinguish the influence of nearby versus
distant agents, nor systematically test model robustness across varying
multi-agent interactions. This paper addresses this critical gap by proposing a
novel testing framework that evaluates prediction performance under diverse
scene structures, saying, map context, agent density and spatial distribution.
Through extensive empirical analysis, we quantify the differential impact of
agent proximity on target trajectory prediction and identify scenario-specific
failure cases that are not exposed by traditional metrics. Our findings
highlight key vulnerabilities in current state-of-the-art prediction models and
demonstrate the importance of scenario-aware evaluation. The proposed framework
lays the groundwork for rigorous, safety-driven prediction validation,
contributing significantly to the identification of failure-prone corner cases
and the development of robust, certifiable prediction systems for autonomous
vehicles.

*Yanjiang Guo,Lucy Xiaoyang Shi,Jianyu Chen,Chelsea Finn*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in evaluating and improving the adaptability of generalist robot policies to unfamiliar scenarios by introducing a controllable multi-view world model that supports long-horizon interactions and action precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalist robot policies face difficulties when tested with unfamiliar objects and instructions due to the inefficiencies of real-world evaluations and improvements. World models present a scalable solution, but existing models are not compatible with modern policies.

Method: The paper introduces a multi-view world model with long-horizon consistency via pose-conditioned memory retrieval and precise action control through frame-level action conditioning, trained on the DROID dataset.

Result: The model generates consistent multi-step trajectories in new scenarios and can rank policy performance accurately without real-world rollouts. Additionally, synthesizing and fine-tuning with successful imagined trajectories improves policy success by 44.7%.

Conclusion: The proposed world model can effectively evaluate and improve generalist robot policies in a scalable way, reducing the reliance on costly real-world rollouts.

Abstract: Generalist robot policies can now perform a wide range of manipulation
skills, but evaluating and improving their ability with unfamiliar objects and
instructions remains a significant challenge. Rigorous evaluation requires a
large number of real-world rollouts, while systematic improvement demands
additional corrective data with expert labels. Both of these processes are
slow, costly, and difficult to scale. World models offer a promising, scalable
alternative by enabling policies to rollout within imagination space. However,
a key challenge is building a controllable world model that can handle
multi-step interactions with generalist robot policies. This requires a world
model compatible with modern generalist policies by supporting multi-view
prediction, fine-grained action control, and consistent long-horizon
interactions, which is not achieved by previous works. In this paper, we make a
step forward by introducing a controllable multi-view world model that can be
used to evaluate and improve the instruction-following ability of generalist
robot policies. Our model maintains long-horizon consistency with a
pose-conditioned memory retrieval mechanism and achieves precise action control
through frame-level action conditioning. Trained on the DROID dataset (95k
trajectories, 564 scenes), our model generates spatially and temporally
consistent trajectories under novel scenarios and new camera placements for
over 20 seconds. We show that our method can accurately rank policy performance
without real-world robot rollouts. Moreover, by synthesizing successful
trajectories in imagination and using them for supervised fine-tuning, our
approach can improve policy success by 44.7\%.

*LinFeng Li,Jian Zhao,Yuan Xie,Xin Tan,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a new paradigm for training Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in navigation, shifting from Path Imitation to Decision Understanding. It introduces a novel dataset (Compass-Data-22k) and designs a unique reward function for improved goal navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for training LVLMs in navigation rely too heavily on replicating expert paths, limiting exploration and generalization. This paper aims to develop agents that truly understand navigation by focusing on decision-making and goal-oriented actions.

Method: The paper introduces Compass-Data-22k to provide comprehensive decision annotations, including geodesic distances. It also proposes a hybrid reward function to dynamically adapt feedback and integrates this into a novel training recipe combining Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning.

Result: The proposed CompassNav agent outperforms state-of-the-art models in goal navigation benchmarks and even works effectively in real-world robotic navigation scenarios, beating larger proprietary models.

Conclusion: Training LVLMs with decision understanding rather than path imitation offers superior navigation capabilities. The CompassNav agent demonstrates the potential for more generalized and effective navigation in both simulated and real-world environments.

Abstract: The dominant paradigm for training Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in
navigation relies on imitating expert trajectories. This approach reduces the
complex navigation task to a sequence-to-sequence replication of a single
correct path, fundamentally limiting the agent's ability to explore and
generalize. In this work, we argue for and introduce a new paradigm: a shift
from Path Imitation to Decision Understanding. The goal of this paradigm is to
build agents that do not just follow, but truly understand how to navigate. We
materialize this through two core contributions: first, we introduce
Compass-Data-22k, a novel 22k-trajectory dataset.Its Reinforcement Fine-Tuning
(RFT) subset provides a panoramic view of the decision landscape by annotating
all feasible actions with A* geodesic distances. Second, we design a novel
gap-aware hybrid reward function that dynamically adapts its feedback to
decision certainty, shifting between decisive signals for optimal actions and
nuanced scores to encourage exploration. Integrated into an SFT-then-RFT
recipe, our CompassNav agent is trained not to memorize static routes, but to
develop an internal ``compass'' that constantly intuits the direction to the
goal by evaluating the relative quality of all possible moves. This approach
enables our 7B agent to set a new state-of-the-art on Goal navigation
benchmarks, outperforming even larger proprietary models, and achieve robust
real-world goal navigation on a physical robot.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework called Dejavu allowing embodied agents to adapt and improve post-deployment by using past successful experiences to guide actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Embodied agents lack the ability to acquire new knowledge and improve performance autonomously after deployment.

Method: The paper proposes Dejavu, a framework that uses an Experience Feedback Network (EFN) to reference past successful action experiences, combined with reinforcement learning based on semantic similarity rewards.

Result: EFN enables "learning from experience" by continually updating trajectories, achieving improved adaptability, robustness, and success rates in embodied tasks.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the potential for creating embodied agents capable of refining behavior and performance continually even after deployment.

Abstract: Embodied agents face a fundamental limitation: once deployed in real-world
environments to perform specific tasks, they are unable to acquire new useful
knowledge to enhance task performance. In this paper, we propose a general
post-deployment learning framework called Dejavu, which employs an Experience
Feedback Network (EFN) and augments the frozen Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
policy with retrieved execution memories. EFN automatically identifies
contextually successful prior action experiences and conditions action
prediction on this retrieved guidance. We adopt reinforcement learning with
semantic similarity rewards on EFN to ensure that the predicted actions align
with past successful behaviors under current observations. During deployment,
EFN continually enriches its memory with new trajectories, enabling the agent
to exhibit "learning from experience" despite fixed weights. Experiments across
diverse embodied tasks show that EFN significantly improves adaptability,
robustness, and success rates over frozen baselines. These results highlight a
promising path toward embodied agents that continually refine their behavior
after deployment.

*Zuhong Liu,Junhao Ge,Minhao Xiong,Jiahao Gu,Bowei Tang,Wei Jing,Siheng Chen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Harmanoid introduces a dual-humanoid motion imitation system that enables realistic whole-body interactions by carefully modeling inter-agent dynamics and contact fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of single-humanoid frameworks that overlook the complexities of inter-agent dynamics in physically and socially meaningful interactions.

Method: The framework employs two components: a contact-aware motion retargeting system aligning humanoid interactions with robots, and an interaction-driven motion controller using rewards for coordinated and realistic robot behaviors.

Result: Harmanoid achieves superior performance in interactive motion imitation compared to single-humanoid frameworks.

Conclusion: This dual-humanoid approach is effective at preserving both kinematic fidelity and physical realism in coordinated humanoid interactions.

Abstract: The true promise of humanoid robotics lies beyond single-agent autonomy: two
or more humanoids must engage in physically grounded, socially meaningful
whole-body interactions that echo the richness of human social interaction.
However, single-humanoid methods suffer from the isolation issue, ignoring
inter-agent dynamics and causing misaligned contacts, interpenetrations, and
unrealistic motions. To address this, we present Harmanoid , a dual-humanoid
motion imitation framework that transfers interacting human motions to two
robots while preserving both kinematic fidelity and physical realism. Harmanoid
comprises two key components: (i) contact-aware motion retargeting, which
restores inter-body coordination by aligning SMPL contacts with robot vertices,
and (ii) interaction-driven motion controller, which leverages
interaction-specific rewards to enforce coordinated keypoints and physically
plausible contacts. By explicitly modeling inter-agent contacts and
interaction-aware dynamics, Harmanoid captures the coupled behaviors between
humanoids that single-humanoid frameworks inherently overlook. Experiments
demonstrate that Harmanoid significantly improves interactive motion imitation,
surpassing existing single-humanoid frameworks that largely fail in such
scenarios.

*Hyogo Hiruma,Hiroshi Ito,Tetsuya Ogata*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces UF-RNN, a model that uses uncertainty foresight to improve robot performance in ambiguous environments, outperforming standard methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots struggle to operate in uncertain environments, where properties of objects or interactions are unpredictable, and current methods often overlook failure scenarios.

Method: The UF-RNN model was developed, combining time-series prediction with a 'Foresight' module that minimizes predicted variance using future trajectory simulations.

Result: UF-RNN showed superior results in both simulated and real robotic door-opening tasks, promoting effective exploratory behaviors in high-uncertainty scenarios.

Conclusion: Incorporating uncertainty-driven foresight into robotics imitation learning enhances adaptability and success in unpredictable environments.

Abstract: Training robots to operate effectively in environments with uncertain states,
such as ambiguous object properties or unpredictable interactions, remains a
longstanding challenge in robotics. Imitation learning methods typically rely
on successful examples and often neglect failure scenarios where uncertainty is
most pronounced. To address this limitation, we propose the Uncertainty-driven
Foresight Recurrent Neural Network (UF-RNN), a model that combines standard
time-series prediction with an active "Foresight" module. This module performs
internal simulations of multiple future trajectories and refines the hidden
state to minimize predicted variance, enabling the model to selectively explore
actions under high uncertainty. We evaluate UF-RNN on a door-opening task in
both simulation and a real-robot setting, demonstrating that, despite the
absence of explicit failure demonstrations, the model exhibits robust
adaptation by leveraging self-induced chaotic dynamics in its latent space.
When guided by the Foresight module, these chaotic properties stimulate
exploratory behaviors precisely when the environment is ambiguous, yielding
improved success rates compared to conventional stochastic RNN baselines. These
findings suggest that integrating uncertainty-driven foresight into imitation
learning pipelines can significantly enhance a robot's ability to handle
unpredictable real-world conditions.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study introduces an $A^3 RNN$ attention model to explore how human-like attention behaviors develop in robotic learning through the interaction of top-down (TD) and bottom-up (BU) visual attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to understand the emergence of structured, dynamic attentional behaviors in robotic systems via the interplay of TD and BU mechanisms.

Method: A novel bi-directional attention model, $A^3 RNN$, is designed to integrate predictive TD signals and saliency-based BU cues and evaluated through robotic manipulation tasks using imitation learning.

Result: Experimental findings reveal an evolution from saliency-driven exploration to prediction-driven attention direction during training, aligning with cognitive science principles.

Conclusion: The proposed model shows coherent and interpretable attention patterns, implying that developmental mechanisms foster robust attention formation in robotic learning.

Abstract: This study investigates the developmental interaction between top-down (TD)
and bottom-up (BU) visual attention in robotic learning. Our goal is to
understand how structured, human-like attentional behavior emerges through the
mutual adaptation of TD and BU mechanisms over time. To this end, we propose a
novel attention model $A^3 RNN$ that integrates predictive TD signals and
saliency-based BU cues through a bi-directional attention architecture.
  We evaluate our model in robotic manipulation tasks using imitation learning.
Experimental results show that attention behaviors evolve throughout training,
from saliency-driven exploration to prediction-driven direction. Initially, BU
attention highlights visually salient regions, which guide TD processes, while
as learning progresses, TD attention stabilizes and begins to reshape what is
perceived as salient. This trajectory reflects principles from cognitive
science and the free-energy framework, suggesting the importance of
self-organizing attention through interaction between perception and internal
prediction. Although not explicitly optimized for stability, our model exhibits
more coherent and interpretable attention patterns than baselines, supporting
the idea that developmental mechanisms contribute to robust attention
formation.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a simulation model for the PAL Robotics TIAGo++ Omni mobile manipulator in Isaac Sim, catering specifically to its omnidirectional drive dynamics, which includes accurate and lightweight control models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There was no existing Isaac Sim model of the PAL Robotics TIAGo++ Omni, a versatile and widely applicable mobile manipulator, preventing simulation-driven studies and progress.

Method: The authors developed and calibrated two control models for the robot's omnidirectional drive: a physically accurate wheel dynamics model and a lightweight velocity-based model. They also used a learning-based calibration method to approximate the real robot's velocity profile using minimal data.

Result: The proposed simulation effectively mimics the real robot’s behavior, especially its omnidirectional drive dynamics. These models can help perform efficient simulation and learning-based controls.

Conclusion: The introduced TIAGo++ Omni model in Isaac Sim enables researchers to experiment and conduct learning-based applications with an accurate and versatile setup, made publicly available online.

Abstract: Efficient physics simulation has significantly accelerated research progress
in robotics applications such as grasping and assembly. The advent of
GPU-accelerated simulation frameworks like Isaac Sim has particularly empowered
learning-based methods, enabling them to tackle increasingly complex tasks. The
PAL Robotics TIAGo++ Omni is a versatile mobile manipulator equipped with a
mecanum-wheeled base, allowing omnidirectional movement and a wide range of
task capabilities. However, until now, no model of the robot has been available
in Isaac Sim. In this paper, we introduce such a model, calibrated to
approximate the behavior of the real robot, with a focus on its omnidirectional
drive dynamics. We present two control models for the omnidirectional drive: a
physically accurate model that replicates real-world wheel dynamics and a
lightweight velocity-based model optimized for learning-based applications.
With these models, we introduce a learning-based calibration approach to
approximate the real robot's S-shaped velocity profile using minimal trajectory
data recordings. This simulation should allow researchers to experiment with

Conclusion: X-VLA proves to be a scalable and simple architecture that effectively addresses cross-embodiment challenges in VLA tasks while achieving superior performance and adaptability.

Abstract: Successful generalist Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models rely on effective
training across diverse robotic platforms with large-scale, cross-embodiment,
heterogeneous datasets. To facilitate and leverage the heterogeneity in rich,
diverse robotic data sources, we propose a novel Soft Prompt approach with
minimally added parameters, by infusing prompt learning concepts into
cross-embodiment robot learning and introducing separate sets of learnable
embeddings for each distinct data source. These embeddings serve as
embodiment-specific prompts, which in unity empower VLA models with effective
exploitation of varying cross-embodiment features. Our new X-VLA, a neat
flow-matching-based VLA architecture, relies exclusively on soft-prompted
standard Transformer encoders, enjoying both scalability and simplicity.
Evaluated across 6 simulations as well as 3 real-world robots, our 0.9B

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deep reinforcement learning framework using SAC for safe navigation of double-Ackermann-steering mobile robots in cluttered environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DASMRs, due to their complex kinematics, struggle with classical planning approaches, especially in obstructed scenarios, motivating the need for a robust navigation framework.

Method: The framework combines Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) with Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) and CrossQ overlay to train the robot policy for efficient and obstacle-free navigation.

Result: In simulation on a heavy four-wheel-steering rover, the trained policy achieved a 97% success rate in reaching target positions while avoiding obstacles.

Conclusion: The framework offers reliable navigation without requiring handcrafted trajectories or expert demonstrations, demonstrating its potential effectiveness for real-world applications.

Abstract: We present a deep reinforcement learning framework based on Soft Actor-Critic
(SAC) for safe and precise maneuvering of double-Ackermann-steering mobile
robots (DASMRs). Unlike holonomic or simpler non-holonomic robots such as
differential-drive robots, DASMRs face strong kinematic constraints that make
classical planners brittle in cluttered environments. Our framework leverages
the Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) and the CrossQ overlay to encourage
maneuvering efficiency while avoiding obstacles. Simulation results with a
heavy four-wheel-steering rover show that the learned policy can robustly reach
up to 97% of target positions while avoiding obstacles. Our framework does not
rely on handcrafted trajectories or expert demonstrations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Historically, chemistry has relied on manual processes that are often time-consuming. Automation has been limited, and there is a drive to improve adaptability, reproducibility, and safety in chemical experimentation.

Conclusion: The future of chemistry is envisioned as a partnership between human expertise and robotic precision, fostering greater efficiency and innovative breakthroughs in the discipline.

Abstract: Chemistry, a long-standing discipline, has historically relied on manual and
often time-consuming processes. While some automation exists, the field is now
on the cusp of a significant evolution driven by the integration of robotics
and artificial intelligence (AI), giving rise to the concept of the
robochemist: a new paradigm where autonomous systems assist in designing,
executing, and analyzing experiments. Robochemists integrate mobile
manipulators, advanced perception, teleoperation, and data-driven protocols to
execute experiments with greater adaptability, reproducibility, and safety.
Rather than a fully automated replacement for human chemists, we envisioned the
robochemist as a complementary partner that works collaboratively to enhance
discovery, enabling a more efficient exploration of chemical space and
accelerating innovation in pharmaceuticals, materials science, and sustainable
manufacturing. This article traces the technologies, applications, and
challenges that define this transformation, highlighting both the opportunities
and the responsibilities that accompany the emergence of the robochemist.
Ultimately, the future of chemistry is argued to lie in a symbiotic partnership
where human intuition and expertise is amplified by robotic precision and
AI-driven insight.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces and open-sources sqrtVINS, an ultra-fast visual-inertial navigation system (VINS) that utilizes a square-root filter (SRF) for enhanced numerical stability, dynamic initialization, and resource efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address numerical instability and resource constraints in embedded robotic VINS systems, which often struggle with limited precision and memory usage.

Method: The proposed method leverages a novel Cholesky decomposition-based SRF update to enhance numerical stability and efficiency. It also incorporates a fast initialization process that bypasses 3D feature triangulation and employs iterative SRF updates for refined state estimation.

Result: Experimental tests demonstrate superior performance on 32-bit single-precision floats, with sqrtVINS achieving double the speed of SOTA methods and robust initialization within 100 ms under challenging conditions.

Conclusion: The sqrtVINS system showcases strong efficiency, robustness, and reliability across various scenarios and environments, making it highly valuable for research and applications. The open-source release promotes future development in the field.

Abstract: In this paper, we develop and open-source, for the first time, a square-root
filter (SRF)-based visual-inertial navigation system (VINS), termed sqrtVINS,
which is ultra-fast, numerically stable, and capable of dynamic initialization
even under extreme conditions (i.e., extremely small time window). Despite
recent advancements in VINS, resource constraints and numerical instability on
embedded (robotic) systems with limited precision remain critical challenges. A
square-root covariance-based filter offers a promising solution by providing
numerical stability, efficient memory usage, and guaranteed positive
semi-definiteness. However, canonical SRFs suffer from inefficiencies caused by
disruptions in the triangular structure of the covariance matrix during
updates. The proposed method significantly improves VINS efficiency with a
novel Cholesky decomposition (LLT)-based SRF update, by fully exploiting the
system structure to preserve the structure. Moreover, we design a fast, robust,
dynamic initialization method, which first recovers the minimal states without
triangulating 3D features and then efficiently performs iterative SRF update to
refine the full states, enabling seamless VINS operation. The proposed
LLT-based SRF is extensively verified through numerical studies, demonstrating
superior numerical stability and achieving robust efficient performance on
32-bit single-precision floats, operating at twice the speed of
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Our initialization method, tested on both
mobile workstations and Jetson Nano computers, achieving a high success rate of
initialization even within a 100 ms window under minimal conditions. Finally,
the proposed sqrtVINS is extensively validated across diverse scenarios,
demonstrating strong efficiency, robustness, and reliability. The full
open-source implementation is released to support future research and
applications.

### [737] [Learning to Throw-Flip](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10357)
*Yang Liu,Bruno Da Costa,Aude Billard*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a method enabling robots to throw objects to desired positions and orientations with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Logistic operations can be sped up by enabling robots to perform dynamic manipulation tasks, but current methods don't effectively control the final alignment of objects.

Method: Combines impulse-momentum principles to decouple unwanted rotations during throws and uses physics-based models alongside regression learning to handle unmodeled effects.

Result: The proposed method allows robots to throw objects with a high degree of accuracy, achieving landing pose errors of up to ±5 cm and ±45 degrees with reduced sample complexity.

Conclusion: The approach outperforms traditional techniques by reducing learning complexity and reusing past knowledge, paving the way for efficient dynamic manipulation in robotics.

Abstract: Dynamic manipulation, such as robot tossing or throwing objects, has recently
gained attention as a novel paradigm to speed up logistic operations. However,
the focus has predominantly been on the object's landing location, irrespective
of its final orientation. In this work, we present a method enabling a robot to
accurately "throw-flip" objects to a desired landing pose (position and
orientation). Conventionally, objects thrown by revolute robots suffer from
parasitic rotation, resulting in highly restricted and uncontrollable landing
poses. Our approach is based on two key design choices: first, leveraging the
impulse-momentum principle, we design a family of throwing motions that
effectively decouple the parasitic rotation, significantly expanding the
feasible set of landing poses. Second, we combine a physics-based model of free
flight with regression-based learning methods to account for unmodeled effects.
Real robot experiments demonstrate that our framework can learn to throw-flip
objects to a pose target within ($\pm$5 cm, $\pm$45 degrees) threshold in
dozens of trials. Thanks to data assimilation, incorporating projectile
dynamics reduces sample complexity by an average of 40% when throw-flipping to
unseen poses compared to end-to-end learning methods. Additionally, we show
that past knowledge on in-hand object spinning can be effectively reused,
accelerating learning by 70% when throwing a new object with a Center of Mass
(CoM) shift. A video summarizing the proposed method and the hardware
experiments is available at https://youtu.be/txYc9b1oflU.

across robots deployed as containerized services to simplify fleet scaling and
management. The framework maintains a shared declarative world state and
two-way communication for task execution and replanning. By modularizing each
layer of the autonomy stack and using LLMs for open-world reasoning, RobotFleet
lowers the barrier to building scalable multi-robot systems. The code can be

*Junbin Yuan,Brady Moon,Muqing Cao,Sebastian Scherer*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a hierarchical planner for multi-target tracking with an aerial vehicle, which addresses challenges in large-scale environments by incorporating motion models and uncertainty propagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in persistent tracking of multiple dynamic targets using single-robot systems in large-scale environments due to constrained sensing and short planning horizons.

Method: The method involves decomposing the tracking task into sub-tasks of detecting single targets, using a novel low-level coverage planner for searching in evolving belief areas, and converting the tracking task into an MDP. This MDP is solved with a tree-based algorithm.

Result: The approach was validated in simulations, demonstrating a reduction of 11-70% in final uncertainty compared to existing planners across different environments.

Conclusion: The proposed hierarchical planner significantly improves multi-target tracking performance in large-scale environments versus prior methods.

Abstract: Achieving persistent tracking of multiple dynamic targets over a large
spatial area poses significant challenges for a single-robot system with
constrained sensing capabilities. As the robot moves to track different
targets, the ones outside the field of view accumulate uncertainty, making them
progressively harder to track. An effective path planning algorithm must manage
uncertainty over a long horizon and account for the risk of permanently losing
track of targets that remain unseen for too long. However, most existing
approaches rely on short planning horizons and assume small, bounded
environments, resulting in poor tracking performance and target loss in
large-scale scenarios. In this paper, we present a hierarchical planner for
tracking multiple moving targets with an aerial vehicle. To address the
challenge of tracking non-static targets, our method incorporates motion models
and uncertainty propagation during path execution, allowing for more informed
decision-making. We decompose the multi-target tracking task into sub-tasks of
single target search and detection, and our proposed pipeline consists a novel
low-level coverage planner that enables searching for a target in an evolving
belief area, and an estimation method to assess the likelihood of success for
each sub-task, making it possible to convert the active target tracking task to
a Markov decision process (MDP) that we solve with a tree-based algorithm to
determine the sequence of sub-tasks. We validate our approach in simulation,
demonstrating its effectiveness compared to existing planners for active target
tracking tasks, and our proposed planner outperforms existing approaches,
achieving a reduction of 11-70% in final uncertainty across different
environments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a reinforcement learning framework using symmetry-guided rewards to generate versatile quadrupedal gaits, eliminating the need for extensive manual tuning or predefined trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To eliminate laborious manual tuning of variables when generating quadrupedal robot gaits and enable dynamic transitions between locomotion patterns.

Method: The method uses symmetry-guided reward functions that leverage temporal, morphological, and time-reversal symmetries, allowing natural dynamic transitions without predefined trajectories.

Result: The proposed framework demonstrated robust versatility in generating gaits like trotting, bounding, and galloping on the Unitree Go2 robot across simulations and hardware tests.

Conclusion: The study highlights the role of symmetries in enhancing quadrupedal gait adaptability and offers insights into dynamic robotic locomotion strategies.

Abstract: Quadrupedal robots exhibit a wide range of viable gaits, but generating
specific footfall sequences often requires laborious expert tuning of numerous
variables, such as touch-down and lift-off events and holonomic constraints for
each leg. This paper presents a unified reinforcement learning framework for
generating versatile quadrupedal gaits by leveraging the intrinsic symmetries
and velocity-period relationship of dynamic legged systems. We propose a
symmetry-guided reward function design that incorporates temporal,
morphological, and time-reversal symmetries. By focusing on preserved
symmetries and natural dynamics, our approach eliminates the need for
predefined trajectories, enabling smooth transitions between diverse locomotion
patterns such as trotting, bounding, half-bounding, and galloping. Implemented
on the Unitree Go2 robot, our method demonstrates robust performance across a
range of speeds in both simulations and hardware tests, significantly improving
gait adaptability without extensive reward tuning or explicit foot placement
control. This work provides insights into dynamic locomotion strategies and
underscores the crucial role of symmetries in robotic gait design.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Galilean symmetry to the robotics field, connecting it to established rigid-body transformations and showing its utility through examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bring the underexplored concept of Galilean symmetry into robotics, where rigid-body symmetry is fundamental, filling a gap in existing literature tailored for a robotics audience.

Method: The paper uses a robotics-focused explanation of Galilean symmetry, leveraging the community's familiar pose representations, and demonstrates its applications through examples like inertial navigation, kinematics, and sensor fusion.

Result: The Galilean matrix Lie group is identified as a tool for describing pose representations and solving robotics problems more insightfully in cases like navigation, kinematics, and data fusion under uncertainty.

Conclusion: Introducing Galilean symmetry to robotics holds substantial benefits, and now is an opportune time for the community to adapt and extend this classical concept to modern challenges.

Abstract: Galilean symmetry is the natural symmetry of inertial motion that underpins
Newtonian physics. Although rigid-body symmetry is one of the most established
and fundamental tools in robotics, there appears to be no comparable treatment
of Galilean symmetry for a robotics audience. In this paper, we present a
robotics-tailored exposition of Galilean symmetry that leverages the
community's familiarity with and understanding of rigid-body transformations
and pose representations. Our approach contrasts with common treatments in the
physics literature that introduce Galilean symmetry as a stepping stone to
Einstein's relativity. A key insight is that the Galilean matrix Lie group can
be used to describe two different pose representations, Galilean frames, that
use inertial velocity in the state definition, and extended poses, that use
coordinate velocity. We provide three examples where applying the Galilean
matrix Lie-group algebra to robotics problems is straightforward and yields
significant insights: inertial navigation above the rotating Earth, manipulator
kinematics, and sensor data fusion under temporal uncertainty. We believe that
the time is right for the robotics community to benefit from rediscovering and
extending this classical material and applying it to modern problems.

*Kush Garg,Akshat Dave*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents SuperEx, a framework that uses non-line-of-sight (NLOS) sensing to improve robotic exploration and mapping in unknown indoor environments, achieving higher mapping accuracy and efficiency compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring and mapping unknown indoor environments efficiently is critical, especially in time-sensitive scenarios. Traditional line-of-sight sensing limits visibility to occluded regions, leading to inefficiencies when navigating unfamiliar layouts.

Method: The authors leverage portable single-photon LiDARs for NLOS sensing and introduce SuperEx, which integrates NLOS cues into the mapping and exploration process. The framework uses a combination of physics-based empty region carving and data-driven reconstruction of hidden structures from timing histograms.

Result: Simulation and real-world evaluations demonstrate a 12% improvement in mapping accuracy with less than 30% environmental coverage, alongside greater exploration efficiency compared to baseline systems relying only on line-of-sight sensing.

Conclusion: SuperEx showcases the feasibility and advantages of incorporating NLOS sensing into robotic exploration. This innovation improves mapping accuracy and efficiency in challenging environments, paving the way for broader applicability of NLOS sensing outside controlled settings.

Abstract: Efficient exploration and mapping in unknown indoor environments is a
fundamental challenge, with high stakes in time-critical settings. In current
systems, robot perception remains confined to line-of-sight; occluded regions
remain unknown until physically traversed, leading to inefficient exploration
when layouts deviate from prior assumptions. In this work, we bring
non-line-of-sight (NLOS) sensing to robotic exploration. We leverage
single-photon LiDARs, which capture time-of-flight histograms that encode the
presence of hidden objects - allowing robots to look around blind corners.
Recent single-photon LiDARs have become practical and portable, enabling
deployment beyond controlled lab settings. Prior NLOS works target 3D
reconstruction in static, lab-based scenarios, and initial efforts toward
NLOS-aided navigation consider simplified geometries. We introduce SuperEx, a
framework that integrates NLOS sensing directly into the mapping-exploration
loop. SuperEx augments global map prediction with beyond-line-of-sight cues by
(i) carving empty NLOS regions from timing histograms and (ii) reconstructing
occupied structure via a two-step physics-based and data-driven approach that
leverages structural regularities. Evaluations on complex simulated maps and
the real-world KTH Floorplan dataset show a 12% gain in mapping accuracy under
< 30% coverage and improved exploration efficiency compared to line-of-sight
baselines, opening a path to reliable mapping beyond direct visibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic control often involves high-dimensional, continuous tasks that require both high performance and low energy consumption, an unmet need for resource-constrained environments where traditional Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) solutions are too computationally expensive.

Method: The study introduces a framework combining population-coded Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with DRL, specifically using a Population-coded Spiking Actor Network (PopSAN) for encoding observations into neural activities and optimizing policies through gradient-based updates. Evaluations were conducted on a robotic manipulation benchmark using the Isaac Gym platform.

Result: Experimental results demonstrated energy savings of up to 96.10% compared to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) while maintaining comparable robotic control performance, including stable and precise manipulative operations using a Franka robotic arm.

Conclusion: The integration of population-coded SNNs with DRL offers a viable solution for energy-efficient, high-performance robotic control, offering significant promise for scalable real-world applications in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Energy-efficient and high-performance motor control remains a critical
challenge in robotics, particularly for high-dimensional continuous control
tasks with limited onboard resources. While Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
has achieved remarkable results, its computational demands and energy
consumption limit deployment in resource-constrained environments. This paper
introduces a novel framework combining population-coded Spiking Neural Networks
(SNNs) with DRL to address these challenges. Our approach leverages the
event-driven, asynchronous computation of SNNs alongside the robust policy
optimization capabilities of DRL, achieving a balance between energy efficiency
and control performance. Central to this framework is the Population-coded
Spiking Actor Network (PopSAN), which encodes high-dimensional observations
into neuronal population activities and enables optimal policy learning through
gradient-based updates. We evaluate our method on the Isaac Gym platform using
the PixMC benchmark with complex robotic manipulation tasks. Experimental
results on the Franka robotic arm demonstrate that our approach achieves energy
savings of up to 96.10% compared to traditional Artificial Neural Networks
(ANNs) while maintaining comparable control performance. The trained SNN
policies exhibit robust finger position tracking with minimal deviation from
commanded trajectories and stable target height maintenance during
pick-and-place operations. These results position population-coded SNNs as a
promising solution for energy-efficient, high-performance robotic control in
resource-constrained applications, paving the way for scalable deployment in
real-world robotics systems.

Motivation: To improve remote-control operability in contact-rich tasks by synchronizing positions and forces of manipulators and enabling intuitive, adaptable control in the Cartesian coordinate system.

Method: A 4-channel bilateral control method was proposed, specifically designed to decouple each dimension in the Cartesian coordinate system, regardless of the scaling factor.

Result: A novel control approach was developed to enhance compatibility and dynamics adjustment in remote manipulation systems.

Conclusion: The proposed 4-channel bilateral control provides improved operability, dynamics adjustment, and usability in the Cartesian coordinate system, making it suitable for a wide range of manipulators with varied structures.

Abstract: Four-channel bilateral control is a method for achieving remote control with
force feedback and adjustment operability by synchronizing the positions and
forces of two manipulators. This is expected to significantly improve the
operability of the remote control in contact-rich tasks. Among these, 4-channel
bilateral control on the Cartesian coordinate system is advantageous owing to
its suitability for manipulators with different structures and because it
allows the dynamics in the Cartesian coordinate system to be adjusted by
adjusting the control parameters, thus achieving intuitive operability for
humans. This paper proposes a 4-channel bilateral control method that achieves
the desired dynamics by decoupling each dimension in the Cartesian coordinate
system regardless of the scaling factor.

*Alexander Langmann,Yevhenii Tokarev,Mattia Piccinini,Korbinian Moller,Johannes Betz*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to dynamically adjust cost function parameters of a trajectory planner for autonomous racing, improving both safety and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sampling-based trajectory planners rely on static weights in cost functions, limiting their adaptability across diverse autonomous racing scenarios.

Method: Reinforcement Learning is used as a high-level selector to adjust cost function parameters dynamically during runtime in a low-level trajectory planner.

Result: The approach achieved a 0% collision rate and reduced overtaking time by up to 60% in simulation, compared to static planners.

Conclusion: Integrating RL enables dynamic behavior switching, improving safety and competitiveness, and offers an adaptive and interpretable solution for motion planning in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Sampling-based trajectory planners are widely used for agile autonomous
driving due to their ability to generate fast, smooth, and kinodynamically
feasible trajectories. However, their behavior is often governed by a cost
function with manually tuned, static weights, which forces a tactical
compromise that is suboptimal across the wide range of scenarios encountered in
a race. To address this shortcoming, we propose using a Reinforcement Learning
(RL) agent as a high-level behavioral selector that dynamically switches the
cost function parameters of an analytical, low-level trajectory planner during
runtime. We show the effectiveness of our approach in simulation in an
autonomous racing environment where our RL-based planner achieved 0% collision
rate while reducing overtaking time by up to 60% compared to state-of-the-art
static planners. Our new agent now dynamically switches between aggressive and
conservative behaviors, enabling interactive maneuvers unattainable with static
configurations. These results demonstrate that integrating reinforcement
learning as a high-level selector resolves the inherent trade-off between
safety and competitiveness in autonomous racing planners. The proposed
methodology offers a pathway toward adaptive yet interpretable motion planning
for broader autonomous driving applications.

enhancing operational efficiency. Vision-based navigation relying on
traditional CCD or CMOS cameras faces major challenges when complex
illumination conditions are paired with motion, limiting the range and
accessibility of mobile planetary robots. In this study, we propose a novel
approach to planetary navigation that leverages the unique imaging capabilities
of Single-Photon Avalanche Diode (SPAD) cameras. We present the first
comprehensive evaluation of single-photon imaging as an alternative passive
sensing technology for robotic exploration missions targeting perceptually
challenging locations, with a special emphasis on high-latitude lunar regions.
We detail the operating principles and performance characteristics of SPAD
cameras, assess their advantages and limitations in addressing key perception
challenges of upcoming exploration missions to the Moon, and benchmark their
performance under representative illumination conditions.

*Zhuoheng Gao,Jiyao Zhang,Zhiyong Xie,Hao Dong,Zhaofei Yu,Rongmei Chen,Guozhang Chen,Tiejun Huang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SpikeGrasp is a neuro-inspired robotic grasping system that bypasses the need for 3D point clouds by processing raw event data from spike cameras, achieving superior efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a robotic grasping system inspired by biological intelligence that does not require computationally expensive 3D point cloud reconstruction.

Method: SpikeGrasp processes asynchronous event data from stereo spike cameras using a recurrent spiking neural network to infer grasp poses without constructing point clouds.

Result: SpikeGrasp outperforms traditional point-cloud-based baselines in complex environments like cluttered or textureless scenes, while also showing higher data efficiency.

Conclusion: This neuro-inspired method demonstrates that robotic grasping systems can achieve biological-like efficiency and dexterity, especially with dynamic objects, opening new horizons for robotics.

Abstract: Most robotic grasping systems rely on converting sensor data into explicit 3D
point clouds, which is a computational step not found in biological
intelligence. This paper explores a fundamentally different, neuro-inspired
paradigm for 6-DoF grasp detection. We introduce SpikeGrasp, a framework that
mimics the biological visuomotor pathway, processing raw, asynchronous events
from stereo spike cameras, similarly to retinas, to directly infer grasp poses.
Our model fuses these stereo spike streams and uses a recurrent spiking neural
network, analogous to high-level visual processing, to iteratively refine grasp
hypotheses without ever reconstructing a point cloud. To validate this
approach, we built a large-scale synthetic benchmark dataset. Experiments show
that SpikeGrasp surpasses traditional point-cloud-based baselines, especially
in cluttered and textureless scenes, and demonstrates remarkable data
efficiency. By establishing the viability of this end-to-end, neuro-inspired
approach, SpikeGrasp paves the way for future systems capable of the fluid and
efficient manipulation seen in nature, particularly for dynamic objects.

*Haoyu Zhao,Cheng Zeng,Linghao Zhuang,Yaxi Zhao,Shengke Xue,Hao Wang,Xingyue Zhao,Zhongyu Li,Kehan Li,Siteng Huang,Mingxiu Chen,Xin Li,Deli Zhao,Hua Zou*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RoboSimGS is proposed as a Real2Sim2Real framework for robotic learning, leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting for appearance, mesh primitives for physics, and a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) to automate the creation of interactive simulation assets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic learning is limited by the high cost of real-world data collection and the lack of generalizability of simulated data to real-world scenarios.

Method: RoboSimGS reconstructs simulation environments by combining 3D Gaussian Splatting for photorealism, mesh primitives for physics interaction, and MLLM to infer physical and kinematic object properties.

Result: RoboSimGS enables zero-shot sim-to-real transfer for robotic tasks and enhances the performance of state-of-the-art methods using its data.

Conclusion: The framework effectively bridges the sim-to-real gap, offering a scalable and powerful solution for robotic manipulation tasks.

Abstract: The scalability of robotic learning is fundamentally bottlenecked by the
significant cost and labor of real-world data collection. While simulated data
offers a scalable alternative, it often fails to generalize to the real world
due to significant gaps in visual appearance, physical properties, and object
interactions. To address this, we propose RoboSimGS, a novel Real2Sim2Real
framework that converts multi-view real-world images into scalable,
high-fidelity, and physically interactive simulation environments for robotic
manipulation. Our approach reconstructs scenes using a hybrid representation:
3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) captures the photorealistic appearance of the
environment, while mesh primitives for interactive objects ensure accurate
physics simulation. Crucially, we pioneer the use of a Multi-modal Large
Language Model (MLLM) to automate the creation of physically plausible,
articulated assets. The MLLM analyzes visual data to infer not only physical
properties (e.g., density, stiffness) but also complex kinematic structures
(e.g., hinges, sliding rails) of objects. We demonstrate that policies trained
entirely on data generated by RoboSimGS achieve successful zero-shot
sim-to-real transfer across a diverse set of real-world manipulation tasks.
Furthermore, data from RoboSimGS significantly enhances the performance and
generalization capabilities of SOTA methods. Our results validate RoboSimGS as
a powerful and scalable solution for bridging the sim-to-real gap.

*Jianke Zhang,Yucheng Hu,Yanjiang Guo,Xiaoyu Chen,Yichen Liu,Wenna Chen,Chaochao Lu,Jianyu Chen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: UniCoD aims to build generalist robot policies by combining vision-language comprehension and visual dynamics modeling through pretraining on internet-scale videos and fine-tuning on robotic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to develop robotic policies capable of handling diverse tasks by leveraging the strengths of both vision-language understanding and visual-dynamics modeling.

Method: The approach, named UniCoD, pretrains on over 1M instructional manipulation videos to model high-dimensional visual features and fine-tunes on robotic embodiment data to map predictive representations to action tokens.

Result: UniCoD outperforms baseline methods, improving performance by 9% in simulation environments and 12% in real-world, out-of-distribution tasks.

Conclusion: Combining comprehension, planning, and continuous visual representation learning through pretraining benefits robotic policy learning in diverse tasks and environments.

Abstract: Building generalist robot policies that can handle diverse tasks in
open-ended environments is a central challenge in robotics. To leverage
knowledge from large-scale pretraining, prior work has typically built
generalist policies either on top of vision-language understanding models
(VLMs) or generative models. However, both semantic understanding from
vision-language pretraining and visual dynamics modeling from visual-generation
pretraining are crucial for embodied robots. Recent unified models of
generation and understanding have demonstrated strong capabilities in both
comprehension and generation through large-scale pretraining. We posit that
robotic policy learning can likewise benefit from the combined strengths of
understanding, planning and continuous future representation learning. Building
on this insight, we introduce UniCoD, which acquires the ability to dynamically
model high-dimensional visual features through pretraining on over 1M
internet-scale instructional manipulation videos. Subsequently, UniCoD is
fine-tuned on data collected from the robot embodiment, enabling the learning
of mappings from predictive representations to action tokens. Extensive
experiments show our approach consistently outperforms baseline methods in
terms of 9\% and 12\% across simulation environments and real-world
out-of-distribution tasks.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DINOS-R is a new mission planning and execution software for AUVs, which integrates symbolic decision-making, machine learning, and reactive behaviors. Tested on AUV Sentry, the software is designed for modularity, extensibility, and user accessibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To replace the legacy MC architecture with a modern system that integrates advanced planning and AI techniques for improved AUV mission planning and execution.

Method: DINOS-R combines symbolic decision-making, machine learning, and reactive behaviors into a cohesive system. It's implemented in Python3, designed to be modular, extensible, and user-friendly, with flexible mission and behavior specification options. Real-world tests and simulations were conducted.

Result: The software was successfully tested on the AUV Sentry, demonstrating its capabilities in real-world and simulated scenarios.

Conclusion: DINOS-R bridges a gap in AUV mission planning by unifying advanced decision-making tools and is a promising platform for future oceanographic research and robotics algorithms.

Abstract: A new AUV mission planning and execution software has been tested on AUV
Sentry. Dubbed DINOS-R, it draws inspiration from cognitive architectures and
AUV control systems to replace the legacy MC architecture. Unlike these
existing architectures, however, DINOS-R is built from the ground-up to unify
symbolic decision making (for understandable, repeatable, provable behavior)
with machine learning techniques and reactive behaviors, for field-readiness
across oceanographic platforms. Implemented primarily in Python3, DINOS-R is
extensible, modular, and reusable, with an emphasis on non-expert use as well
as growth for future research in oceanography and robot algorithms. Mission
specification is flexible, and can be specified declaratively. Behavior
specification is similarly flexible, supporting simultaneous use of real-time
task planning and hard-coded user specified plans. These features were
demonstrated in the field on Sentry, in addition to a variety of simulated
cases. These results are discussed, and future work is outlined.

### [752] [Controllable Generative Trajectory Prediction via Weak Preference Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10731)
*Yongxi Cao,Julian F. Schumann,Jens Kober,Joni Pajarinen,Arkady Zgonnikov*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces PrefCVAE, an augmented framework for generating controllable and semantically meaningful trajectory predictions using conditional variational autoencoders, aimed at improving safety in autonomous vehicle planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing trajectory prediction methods for autonomous vehicles focus primarily on accuracy but lack controllable diversity in predictions, which is key for accounting for uncertainty in human behaviors.

Method: PrefCVAE incorporates weakly labeled preference pairs into a CVAE framework to imbue latent variables with semantic attributes, enabling controllable and semantically meaningful output.

Result: Using average velocity as an attribute, PrefCVAE demonstrated controlled and meaningful trajectory predictions without compromising accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed approach leverages preference supervision effectively, providing an economically viable solution for enhancing diversity and semantics in deep generative models for trajectory prediction.

Abstract: Deep generative models such as conditional variational autoencoders (CVAEs)
have shown great promise for predicting trajectories of surrounding agents in
autonomous vehicle planning. State-of-the-art models have achieved remarkable
accuracy in such prediction tasks. Besides accuracy, diversity is also crucial
for safe planning because human behaviors are inherently uncertain and
multimodal. However, existing methods generally lack a scheme to generate
controllably diverse trajectories, which is arguably more useful than randomly
diversified trajectories, to the end of safe planning. To address this, we
propose PrefCVAE, an augmented CVAE framework that uses weakly labeled
preference pairs to imbue latent variables with semantic attributes. Using
average velocity as an example attribute, we demonstrate that PrefCVAE enables
controllable, semantically meaningful predictions without degrading baseline
accuracy. Our results show the effectiveness of preference supervision as a
cost-effective way to enhance sampling-based generative models.

### [753] [Gain Tuning Is Not What You Need: Reward Gain Adaptation for Constrained Locomotion Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10759)
*Arthicha Srisuchinnawong,Poramate Manoonpong*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ROGER introduces online reward-weighting gains adaption to solve constraint violations and offline tuning issues in robot locomotion learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the constraints violation issues and dependence on offline reward weighting gains tuning in existing robot locomotion learning techniques.

Method: Developed an adaptive online system (ROGER) that adjusts reward-weighting gains based on penalties received during the interaction process.

Result: ROGER ensured near-zero constraint violations, achieved significantly higher performance metrics, and reduced torque usage in various benchmarks.

Conclusion: ROGER simplifies robot locomotion learning by removing the need for manual reward tuning and enabling real-world implementation without constraint violations.

Abstract: Existing robot locomotion learning techniques rely heavily on the offline
selection of proper reward weighting gains and cannot guarantee constraint
satisfaction (i.e., constraint violation) during training. Thus, this work aims
to address both issues by proposing Reward-Oriented Gains via Embodied
Regulation (ROGER), which adapts reward-weighting gains online based on
penalties received throughout the embodied interaction process. The ratio
between the positive reward (primary reward) and negative reward (penalty)
gains is automatically reduced as the learning approaches the constraint
thresholds to avoid violation. Conversely, the ratio is increased when learning
is in safe states to prioritize performance. With a 60-kg quadruped robot,
ROGER achieved near-zero constraint violation throughout multiple learning
trials. It also achieved up to 50% more primary reward than the equivalent
state-of-the-art techniques. In MuJoCo continuous locomotion benchmarks,
including a single-leg hopper, ROGER exhibited comparable or up to 100% higher
performance and 60% less torque usage and orientation deviation compared to
those trained with the default reward function. Finally, real-world locomotion
learning of a physical quadruped robot was achieved from scratch within one
hour without any falls. Therefore, this work contributes to
constraint-satisfying real-world continual robot locomotion learning and
simplifies reward weighting gain tuning, potentially facilitating the
development of physical robots and those that learn in the real world.

*Christopher D. Hsu,Pratik Chaudhari*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes using the Universal Scene Description (USD) language as a general representation for geometric, photometric, and semantic information in environments to enhance large language model (LLM)-based robotics tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots need natural language-based priors for reasoning about abstract task specifications, but existing approaches are tailored to specific tasks. The authors aim to develop a more universal and flexible representation.

Method: They demonstrate a system called 'Real to USD,' which uses a quadruped robot equipped with LiDAR and an RGB camera to create USD-based representations of indoor environments. Google's Gemini is used for parsing the USD representation for scene understanding and planning.

Result: Their system successfully builds USD representations of complex indoor environments and performs scene understanding and planning. They evaluated it further in simulated settings like warehouses and hospitals using Nvidia's Isaac Sim.

Conclusion: The USD language is an effective, human- and LLM-readable tool for robotics tasks, offering versatility for diverse applications beyond task-specific solutions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can help robots reason about abstract task
specifications. This requires augmenting classical representations of the
environment used by robots with natural language-based priors. There are a
number of existing approaches to doing so, but they are tailored to specific
tasks, e.g., visual-language models for navigation, language-guided neural
radiance fields for mapping, etc. This paper argues that the Universal Scene
Description (USD) language is an effective and general representation of
geometric, photometric and semantic information in the environment for
LLM-based robotics tasks. Our argument is simple: a USD is an XML-based scene
graph, readable by LLMs and humans alike, and rich enough to support
essentially any task -- Pixar developed this language to store assets, scenes
and even movies. We demonstrate a ``Real to USD'' system using a Unitree Go2
quadruped robot carrying LiDAR and a RGB camera that (i) builds an explicit USD
representation of indoor environments with diverse objects and challenging
settings with lots of glass, and (ii) parses the USD using Google's Gemini to
demonstrate scene understanding, complex inferences, and planning. We also
study different aspects of this system in simulated warehouse and hospital
settings using Nvidia's Issac Sim. Code is available at

*Douglas Hutchings,Luai Abuelsamen,Karthik Rajgopal*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a two-layer Voronoi coverage control system for hybrid aerial-ground robotic coordination, improving response times in hazardous material emergencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of traditional Voronoi coverage control in hazardous material emergencies, including heterogeneity of agent speeds, inefficient clustered deployments, and stringent time constraints.

Method: A decoupled two-layer architecture optimizes aerial and ground robot tasks separately. Aerial agents prioritize high-urgency areas by delivering ground sensors via airdrops, incorporating bounded Voronoi computations and robust control strategies.

Result: The proposed approach significantly reduces response time by 88%, from an average of 220 seconds to 25 seconds, achieving efficient sensor coverage.

Conclusion: The method is effective for emergency contexts with hybrid robotic teams, offering a faster and more efficient solution for hazardous material response scenarios.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive two-layer Voronoi coverage control approach for
coordinating hybrid aerial-ground robot teams in hazardous material emergency
response scenarios. Traditional Voronoi coverage control methods face three
critical limitations in emergency contexts: heterogeneous agent capabilities
with vastly different velocities, clustered initial deployment configurations,
and urgent time constraints requiring rapid response rather than eventual
convergence. Our method addresses these challenges through a decoupled
two-layer architecture that separately optimizes aerial and ground robot
positioning, with aerial agents delivering ground sensors via airdrop to
high-priority locations. We provide detailed implementation of bounded Voronoi
cell computation, efficient numerical integration techniques for
importance-weighted centroids, and robust control strategies that prevent agent
trapping. Simulation results demonstrate an 88% reduction in response time,
achieving target sensor coverage (18.5% of initial sensor loss) in 25 seconds
compared to 220 seconds for ground-only deployment. Complete implementation
code is available at https://github.com/dHutchings/ME292B.

*Alessandro Albini,Mohsen Kaboli,Giorgio Cannata,Perla Maiolino*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper focuses on how tactile data should be structured for robotic tactile perception, with six common representations identified.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic tactile perception involves integrating tactile sensor data with mechanical and computational processes, requiring tailored representations for efficient data processing.

Method: The authors surveyed past studies, analyzing relationships among hardware, data representations, and computational methods in tactile perception. They identified six commonly used data structures.

Result: Six data representation methods commonly used for tactile data were identified, along with guidelines for choosing the appropriate one based on hardware, task requirements, and encoded information.

Conclusion: A clear framework for selecting tactile data representations was established, supporting improved integration between sensors, hardware, and computational processes for task execution.

Abstract: Robotic tactile perception is a complex process involving several
computational steps performed at different levels. Tactile information is
shaped by the interplay of robot actions, the mechanical properties of its
body, and the software that processes the data. In this respect, high-level
computation, required to process and extract information, is commonly performed
by adapting existing techniques from other domains, such as computer vision,
which expects input data to be properly structured. Therefore, it is necessary
to transform tactile sensor data to match a specific data structure. This
operation directly affects the tactile information encoded and, as a
consequence, the task execution. This survey aims to address this specific
aspect of the tactile perception pipeline, namely Data Representation. The
paper first clearly defines its contributions to the perception pipeline and
then reviews how previous studies have dealt with the problem of representing
tactile information, investigating the relationships among hardware,
representations, and high-level computation methods. The analysis has led to
the identification of six structures commonly used in the literature to
represent data. The manuscript provides discussions and guidelines for properly
selecting a representation depending on operating conditions, including the
available hardware, the tactile information required to be encoded, and the
task at hand.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for detecting contact on robot legs using joint torque and force-torque sensors, achieving high accuracy in force measurement and contact localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve torque measurement accuracy and simplify contact detection by eliminating the need for complex friction models and using direct measurements.

Method: The method employs low-cost strain-gauge-based torque sensors and a momentum-based observer framework for detecting and localizing contact along robot legs.

Result: Simulated tests on a 2-DoF robot leg and hardware experiments on a manipulator showed sub-centimeter localization accuracy and force errors below 0.2 N.

Conclusion: The approach achieves accurate torque measurement and reliable contact localization, proving its feasibility for robotic applications.

Abstract: This paper presents a method for detecting and localizing contact along robot
legs using distributed joint torque sensors and a single hip-mounted
force-torque (FT) sensor using a generalized momentum-based observer framework.
We designed a low-cost strain-gauge-based joint torque sensor that can be
installed on every joint to provide direct torque measurements, eliminating the
need for complex friction models and providing more accurate torque readings
than estimation based on motor current. Simulation studies on a floating-based
2-DoF robot leg verified that the proposed framework accurately recovers
contact force and location along the thigh and shin links. Through a
calibration procedure, our torque sensor achieved an average 96.4% accuracy
relative to ground truth measurements. Building upon the torque sensor, we
performed hardware experiments on a 2-DoF manipulator, which showed
sub-centimeter contact localization accuracy and force errors below 0.2 N.

*Tingxuan Leng,Yushi Wang,Tinglong Zheng,Changsheng Luo,Mingguo Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a preference-conditioned multi-objective RL framework to achieve locomotion in humanoid robots that balances command tracking and compliance with external forces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches for humanoid locomotion emphasize robustness over compliance, which can lead to suboptimal maneuvers during human interaction.

Method: The authors employ a preference-conditioned multi-objective RL framework integrating command following and compliance, model external forces via velocity-resistance factors, and utilize an encoder-decoder structure for reward design and privileged feature inference.

Result: Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate improved adaptability and convergence compared to traditional methods, leading to deployable preference-conditioned locomotion policies.

Conclusion: The approach successfully addresses multi-objective balance in humanoid locomotion, enabling robust and compliant actions suitable for real-world applications.

Abstract: Humanoid locomotion requires not only accurate command tracking for
navigation but also compliant responses to external forces during human
interaction. Despite significant progress, existing RL approaches mainly
emphasize robustness, yielding policies that resist external forces but lack
compliance-particularly challenging for inherently unstable humanoids. In this
work, we address this by formulating humanoid locomotion as a multi-objective
optimization problem that balances command tracking and external force
compliance. We introduce a preference-conditioned multi-objective RL (MORL)
framework that integrates rigid command following and compliant behaviors
within a single omnidirectional locomotion policy. External forces are modeled
via velocity-resistance factor for consistent reward design, and training
leverages an encoder-decoder structure that infers task-relevant privileged
features from deployable observations. We validate our approach in both
simulation and real-world experiments on a humanoid robot. Experimental results
indicate that our framework not only improves adaptability and convergence over
standard pipelines, but also realizes deployable preference-conditioned
humanoid locomotion.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GRIP is a modular framework for robot navigation that combines perception, reasoning, and planning. It improves robustness and efficiency in navigating dynamic and complex environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing robotic navigation methods that struggle with adaptability in partially observable and semantically ambiguous environments.

Method: GRIP introduces three variants (Lightweight, Full, and Real-World) that integrate semantic occupancy grids, object grounding, symbolic planning, and hybrid policy execution for robust navigation.

Result: GRIP achieves up to 9.6% higher success rates and more than 2x improvement in path efficiency on benchmarks, while demonstrating strong generalization in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: GRIP is an effective and explainable navigation framework capable of bridging simulation results with real-world deployment, overcoming existing challenges in adaptability and uncertainty.

Abstract: Robots navigating dynamic, cluttered, and semantically complex environments
must integrate perception, symbolic reasoning, and spatial planning to
generalize across diverse layouts and object categories. Existing methods often
rely on static priors or limited memory, constraining adaptability under
partial observability and semantic ambiguity. We present GRIP, Grid-based Relay
with Intermediate Planning, a unified, modular framework with three scalable
variants: GRIP-L (Lightweight), optimized for symbolic navigation via semantic
occupancy grids; GRIP-F (Full), supporting multi-hop anchor chaining and
LLM-based introspection; and GRIP-R (Real-World), enabling physical robot
deployment under perceptual uncertainty. GRIP integrates dynamic 2D grid
construction, open-vocabulary object grounding, co-occurrence-aware symbolic
planning, and hybrid policy execution using behavioral cloning, D* search, and
grid-conditioned control. Empirical results on AI2-THOR and RoboTHOR benchmarks
show that GRIP achieves up to 9.6% higher success rates and over $2\times$
improvement in path efficiency (SPL and SAE) on long-horizon tasks. Qualitative
analyses reveal interpretable symbolic plans in ambiguous scenes. Real-world
deployment on a Jetbot further validates GRIP's generalization under sensor
noise and environmental variation. These results position GRIP as a robust,
scalable, and explainable framework bridging simulation and real-world
navigation.

*Yashom Dighe,Youngjin Kim,Karthik Dantu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to pass time-optimality insights from global planners to local planners using QuayPoints for improved decision-making in autonomous racing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Minimizing latency and improving decision-making in autonomous racing through better integration across autonomy modules.

Method: The framework introduces 'QuayPoints', regions informed by global knowledge where deviations from the optimal raceline compromise time-optimality, thereby enhancing local planner decisions.

Result: Experimental evaluation shows the integration of QuayPoints enables a planner to consistently overtake opponents traveling up to 75% of the ego vehicle's speed across multiple race tracks.

Conclusion: QuayPoints effectively enhance global decision-making in local planners, improving strategic maneuvers and time-optimal racing performance.

Abstract: Autonomous racing requires tight integration between perception, planning and
control to minimize latency as well as timely decision making. A standard
autonomy pipeline comprising a global planner, local planner, and controller
loses information as the higher-level racing context is sequentially propagated
downstream into specific task-oriented context. In particular, the global
planner's understanding of optimality is typically reduced to a sparse set of
waypoints, leaving the local planner to make reactive decisions with limited
context. This paper investigates whether additional global insights,
specifically time-optimality information, can be meaningfully passed to the
local planner to improve downstream decisions. We introduce a framework that
preserves essential global knowledge and conveys it to the local planner
through QuayPoints regions where deviations from the optimal raceline result in
significant compromises to optimality. QuayPoints enable local planners to make
more informed global decisions when deviating from the raceline, such as during
strategic overtaking. To demonstrate this, we integrate QuayPoints into an
existing planner and show that it consistently overtakes opponents traveling at
up to 75% of the ego vehicle's speed across four distinct race tracks.

*Dikshant Shehmar,Matthew E. Taylor,Ehsan Hashemi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes an adaptive control transition strategy for autonomous driving systems that dynamically adjusts based on driver performance and tracking abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for a seamless transition of control from autonomous systems to human drivers, addressing reduced driver readiness caused by out-of-the-loop situations.

Method: Control transition modeled as a cooperative differential game, employing time-varying objective functions and driver-specific state tracking matrices to adapt transitions to individual preferences.

Result: Adaptive transition strategies demonstrated reduced driver trajectory deviations and lower control effort in standardized lane change scenarios, enhancing vehicle stability.

Conclusion: Dynamic, real-time adjustment of control authority improves overall safety, car handling, and driver comfort in transitions between automated systems and human control.

Abstract: The transition of control from autonomous systems to human drivers is
critical in automated driving systems, particularly due to the out-of-the-loop
(OOTL) circumstances that reduce driver readiness and increase reaction times.
Existing takeover strategies are based on fixed time-based transitions, which
fail to account for real-time driver performance variations. This paper
proposes an adaptive transition strategy that dynamically adjusts the control
authority based on both the time and tracking ability of the driver trajectory.
Shared control is modeled as a cooperative differential game, where control
authority is modulated through time-varying objective functions instead of
blending control torques directly. To ensure a more natural takeover, a
driver-specific state-tracking matrix is introduced, allowing the transition to
align with individual control preferences. Multiple transition strategies are
evaluated using a cumulative trajectory error metric. Human-in-the-loop control
scenarios of the standardized ISO lane change maneuvers demonstrate that
adaptive transitions reduce trajectory deviations and driver control effort
compared to conventional strategies. Experiments also confirm that continuously
adjusting control authority based on real-time deviations enhances vehicle
stability while reducing driver effort during takeover.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide a broad and deep analysis of the complex field of robotic manipulation to help researchers grapple with the integration of diverse systems for real-world applications.

Method: The paper categorizes advancements in robotic manipulation with a unified taxonomy, extending classical divisions and identifying bottlenecks, all supported with datasets, benchmarks, and curated resources.

Result: It introduces an expansive taxonomy for both high-level and low-level control strategies and identifies key challenges like data handling and generalization, aiming to make the field more accessible and structured.

Conclusion: The survey serves as a comprehensive guide and resource repository for both new entrants and experienced researchers in robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Embodied intelligence has witnessed remarkable progress in recent years,
driven by advances in computer vision, natural language processing, and the
rise of large-scale multimodal models. Among its core challenges, robot
manipulation stands out as a fundamental yet intricate problem, requiring the
seamless integration of perception, planning, and control to enable interaction
within diverse and unstructured environments. This survey presents a
comprehensive overview of robotic manipulation, encompassing foundational
background, task-organized benchmarks and datasets, and a unified taxonomy of
existing methods. We extend the classical division between high-level planning
and low-level control by broadening high-level planning to include language,
code, motion, affordance, and 3D representations, while introducing a new
taxonomy of low-level learning-based control grounded in training paradigms
such as input modeling, latent learning, and policy learning. Furthermore, we

*Xinyu Shao,Yanzhe Tang,Pengwei Xie,Kaiwen Zhou,Yuzheng Zhuang,Xingyue Quan,Jianye Hao,Long Zeng,Xiu Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RoboMAP introduces adaptive affordance heatmaps for language-guided robots, enhancing spatial reasoning, task success, and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional language-guided robotic systems struggle with perceptual noise and semantic ambiguity by using discrete spatial reasoning.

Method: The framework represents spatial targets with continuous, adaptive affordance heatmaps, providing dense and informative spatial grounding.

Result: RoboMAP achieves significant improvements including a 50x speed-up, an 82% success rate in real-world manipulation, and strong zero-shot generalization.

Conclusion: RoboMAP improves task success, robustness, and interpretability in language-guided robotic systems, setting a new standard in spatial reasoning approaches.

Abstract: Many language-guided robotic systems rely on collapsing spatial reasoning
into discrete points, making them brittle to perceptual noise and semantic
ambiguity. To address this challenge, we propose RoboMAP, a framework that
represents spatial targets as continuous, adaptive affordance heatmaps. This
dense representation captures the uncertainty in spatial grounding and provides
richer information for downstream policies, thereby significantly enhancing
task success and interpretability. RoboMAP surpasses the previous
state-of-the-art on a majority of grounding benchmarks with up to a 50x speed
improvement, and achieves an 82\% success rate in real-world manipulation.
Across extensive simulated and physical experiments, it demonstrates robust
performance and shows strong zero-shot generalization to navigation. More

*Dong Hu,Fenqing Hu,Lidong Yang,Chao Huang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces GTR2L, a game-theoretic risk-shaped reinforcement learning framework aimed at improving safety, adaptability, and efficiency in autonomous driving within complex traffic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of traditional reinforcement learning methods, which neglect explicit modeling of risk and safety in dynamic and complex traffic conditions.

Method: GTR2L combines a game-theoretic world model for behavior prediction and risk assessment, with a dynamic rollout horizon that adjusts to predictive uncertainty. It introduces an uncertainty-aware barrier mechanism for safety modulation and models epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties for constrained policy optimization.

Result: Extensive evaluations demonstrate the framework's superiority over existing methods and human drivers in success rates, reduced collisions/violations, and driving efficiency in diverse, safety-critical scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed GTR2L framework provides a significant improvement in safe and efficient autonomous driving, setting a new standard for incorporating risk-aware decision-making into reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Ensuring safety in autonomous driving (AD) remains a significant challenge,
especially in highly dynamic and complex traffic environments where diverse
agents interact and unexpected hazards frequently emerge. Traditional
reinforcement learning (RL) methods often struggle to balance safety,
efficiency, and adaptability, as they primarily focus on reward maximization
without explicitly modeling risk or safety constraints. To address these
limitations, this study proposes a novel game-theoretic risk-shaped RL (GTR2L)
framework for safe AD. GTR2L incorporates a multi-level game-theoretic world
model that jointly predicts the interactive behaviors of surrounding vehicles
and their associated risks, along with an adaptive rollout horizon that adjusts
dynamically based on predictive uncertainty. Furthermore, an uncertainty-aware
barrier mechanism enables flexible modulation of safety boundaries. A dedicated
risk modeling approach is also proposed, explicitly capturing both epistemic
and aleatoric uncertainty to guide constrained policy optimization and enhance
decision-making in complex environments. Extensive evaluations across diverse
and safety-critical traffic scenarios show that GTR2L significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, including human drivers, in terms of success rate,
collision and violation reduction, and driving efficiency. The code is

### [765] [RoVer: Robot Reward Model as Test-Time Verifier for Vision-Language-Action Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10975)
*Mingtong Dai,Lingbo Liu,Yongjie Bai,Yang Liu,Zhouxia Wang,Rui SU,Chunjie Chen,Liang Lin,Xinyu Wu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces RoVer, a framework that boosts the performance of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models through a test-time scaling process, eliminating the need for extra training or architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the performance of embodied intelligence models, particularly VLAs, often involves costly methods like increasing data or model size. This paper addresses the need for a more cost-effective enhancement method.

Method: RoVer employs a Robot Process Reward Model (PRM) at inference time to assign reliability scores to candidate actions and predicts improvement directions in the action space. It leverages a shared perception cache for cost-effective and scalable action decision-making.

Result: RoVer improves the action decision-making capabilities of existing VLA models without requiring additional training data by evaluating multiple action candidates and selecting optimal ones within the same computational budget.

Conclusion: RoVer provides a generalizable, plug-and-play framework for enhancing VLA models' test-time performance, converting computational resources into better decision-making outcomes without increasing training effort.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have become a prominent paradigm for
embodied intelligence, yet further performance improvements typically rely on
scaling up training data and model size -- an approach that is prohibitively
expensive for robotics and fundamentally limited by data collection costs.We
address this limitation with $\mathbf{RoVer}$, an embodied test-time scaling
framework that uses a $\mathbf{Ro}$bot Process Reward Model (PRM) as a
Test-Time $\mathbf{Ver}$ifier to enhance the capabilities of existing VLA
models without modifying their architectures or weights. Specifically, RoVer
(i) assigns scalar-based process rewards to evaluate the reliability of
candidate actions, and (ii) predicts an action-space direction for candidate
expansion/refinement. During inference, RoVer generates multiple candidate
actions concurrently from the base policy, expands them along PRM-predicted
directions, and then scores all candidates with PRM to select the optimal
action for execution. Notably, by caching shared perception features, it can
amortize perception cost and evaluate more candidates under the same test-time
computational budget. Essentially, our approach effectively transforms
available computing resources into better action decision-making, realizing the
benefits of test-time scaling without extra training overhead. Our
contributions are threefold: (1) a general, plug-and-play test-time scaling
framework for VLAs; (2) a PRM that jointly provides scalar process rewards and
an action-space direction to guide exploration; and (3) an efficient
direction-guided sampling strategy that leverages a shared perception cache to
enable scalable candidate generation and selection during inference.

*Qizhi Guo,Siyuan Yang,Junning Lyu,Jianjun Sun,Defu Lin,Shaoming He*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes AMO-HEAD, a heading estimation approach for UAVs robust against indoor magnetic disturbances, using a modified Extended Kalman Filter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for accurate heading estimation in UAVs for indoor tasks, which is often challenging due to magnetic disturbances.

Method: The paper uses an Adaptive MARG-Only Heading estimation framework based on an Extended Kalman Filter that integrates gyroscope, accelerometer, and magnetometer data, along with adaptive noise compensation mechanisms.

Result: Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of AMO-HEAD in achieving precise heading estimation in indoor magnetically disturbed environments.

Conclusion: AMO-HEAD provides robust and accurate heading estimation for UAVs, addressing challenges from magnetic disturbances through adaptive filtering techniques.

Abstract: Accurate and robust heading estimation is crucial for unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs) when conducting indoor inspection tasks. However, the cluttered
nature of indoor environments often introduces severe magnetic disturbances,
which can significantly degrade heading accuracy. To address this challenge,
this paper presents an Adaptive MARG-Only Heading (AMO-HEAD) estimation
approach for UAVs operating in magnetically disturbed environments. AMO-HEAD is
a lightweight and computationally efficient Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)
framework that leverages inertial and magnetic sensors to achieve reliable
heading estimation. In the proposed approach, gyroscope angular rate
measurements are integrated to propagate the quaternion state, which is
subsequently corrected using accelerometer and magnetometer data. The corrected
quaternion is then used to compute the UAV's heading. An adaptive process noise
covariance method is introduced to model and compensate for gyroscope
measurement noise, bias drift, and discretization errors arising from the Euler
method integration. To mitigate the effects of external magnetic disturbances,
a scaling factor is applied based on real-time magnetic deviation detection. A
theoretical observability analysis of the proposed AMO-HEAD is performed using
the Lie derivative. Extensive experiments were conducted in real world indoor
environments with customized UAV platforms. The results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in providing precise heading estimation
under magnetically disturbed conditions.

TL;DR: The paper presents a pipeline using generative models to obtain probabilistic priors for planning under partial environmental observability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of obtaining effective priors for robotic planning under partial observability, which involves environmental uncertainty and spatio-semantic relationships.

Method: The proposed method uses a sampling-based pipeline that employs pretrained generative models to recover complete RGB-D point cloud samples conditioned on partial observations, capturing occupancy and target semantics.

Result: Experiments show that the approach retrieves commonsense spatial semantics, generates diverse and clean 3D point clouds consistent with ground truth, which are directly useful for motion planning.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of generative models as a rich source of probabilistic priors for robotic planning.

Abstract: Priors are vital for planning under partial observability, yet difficult to
obtain in practice. We present a sampling-based pipeline that leverages
large-scale pretrained generative models to produce probabilistic priors
capturing environmental uncertainty and spatio-semantic relationships in a
zero-shot manner. Conditioned on partial observations, the pipeline recovers
complete RGB-D point cloud samples with occupancy and target semantics,
formulated to be directly useful in configuration-space planning. We establish
a Matterport3D benchmark of rooms partially visible through doorways, where a
robot must navigate to an unobserved target object. Effective priors for this
setting must represent both occupancy and target-location uncertainty in
unobserved regions. Experiments show that our approach recovers commonsense
spatial semantics consistent with ground truth, yielding diverse, clean 3D
point clouds usable in motion planning, highlight the promise of generative
models as a rich source of priors for robotic planning.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Refinery," a framework that improves the robustness and success rate of simulation-based learning for robotic assembly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The researchers aim to address the high variance in robotic policy performance across diverse initial conditions, which poses a challenge to achieving industry-level reliability in contact-rich tasks.

Method: The framework employs Bayesian Optimization for fine-tuning individual policies and a Gaussian Mixture Model for selecting optimal initializations during deployment.

Result: The proposed method improves mean success rates by 10.98%, achieving a 91.51% success rate in simulated robotic assembly and attaining comparable performance in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: Refinery enhances policy reliability in robotic assembly tasks, enabling successful chaining of tasks for long-horizon applications without explicit multi-step training.

Abstract: Simulation-based learning has enabled policies for precise, contact-rich
tasks (e.g., robotic assembly) to reach high success rates (~80%) under high
levels of observation noise and control error. Although such performance may be
sufficient for research applications, it falls short of industry standards and
makes policy chaining exceptionally brittle. A key limitation is the high
variance in individual policy performance across diverse initial conditions. We
introduce Refinery, an effective framework that bridges this performance gap,
robustifying policy performance across initial conditions. We propose Bayesian
Optimization-guided fine-tuning to improve individual policies, and Gaussian
Mixture Model-based sampling during deployment to select initializations that
maximize execution success. Using Refinery, we improve mean success rates by
10.98% over state-of-the-art methods in simulation-based learning for robotic
assembly, reaching 91.51% in simulation and comparable performance in the real
world. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these fine-tuned policies can be
chained to accomplish long-horizon, multi-part
assembly$\unicode{x2013}$successfully assembling up to 8 parts without
requiring explicit multi-step training.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: XGrasp introduces a real-time grasp detection system that adapts to multiple gripper types, addressing challenges in robotic grasping for diverse end-effectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robotic grasping methods are limited to single gripper types, creating inefficiencies in real-world applications with diverse end-effectors.

Method: XGrasp utilizes a two-stage architecture: Grasp Point Predictor (GPP) identifies optimal grasp points using global and gripper-specific data; Angle-Width Predictor (AWP) refines the grasp using local data and employs contrastive learning for zero-shot generalization.

Result: The framework achieves high grasp success rates for various grippers and enhances inference speed compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: XGrasp effectively expands the versatility of grasp detection systems by supporting diverse grippers, paving the way for integration with advanced vision models and improving operational efficiency in robotics.

Abstract: Most robotic grasping methods are typically designed for single gripper
types, which limits their applicability in real-world scenarios requiring
diverse end-effectors. We propose XGrasp, a real-time gripper-aware grasp
detection framework that efficiently handles multiple gripper configurations.
The proposed method addresses data scarcity by systematically augmenting
existing datasets with multi-gripper annotations. XGrasp employs a hierarchical
two-stage architecture. In the first stage, a Grasp Point Predictor (GPP)
identifies optimal locations using global scene information and gripper
specifications. In the second stage, an Angle-Width Predictor (AWP) refines the
grasp angle and width using local features. Contrastive learning in the AWP
module enables zero-shot generalization to unseen grippers by learning
fundamental grasping characteristics. The modular framework integrates
seamlessly with vision foundation models, providing pathways for future
vision-language capabilities. The experimental results demonstrate competitive
grasp success rates across various gripper types, while achieving substantial
improvements in inference speed compared to existing gripper-aware methods.

*Shiyao Zhang,Liwei Deng,Shuyu Zhang,Weijie Yuan,Hong Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deep reinforcement learning-based framework (DRLACP) for autonomous cooperative planning in intelligent transportation systems to handle uncertainties in cooperative motion planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autonomous cooperative planning strategies struggle to address uncertainties related to perception, planning, and communication in multi-vehicle interactions.

Method: The authors propose a novel DRLACP framework using soft actor-critic (SAC) combined with gate recurrent units (GRUs) to optimize actions under imperfect state information caused by planning, communication, and perception uncertainties. Performance is demonstrated via CARLA simulations.

Result: Evaluation shows that DRLACP performs cooperative planning more effectively than baseline methods under various scenarios involving imperfect AV state information.

Conclusion: The DRLACP framework offers an effective solution for tackling uncertainties in autonomous cooperative planning, improving effectiveness and security in multi-vehicle interactions.

Abstract: In future intelligent transportation systems, autonomous cooperative planning
(ACP), becomes a promising technique to increase the effectiveness and security
of multi-vehicle interactions. However, multiple uncertainties cannot be fully
addressed for existing ACP strategies, e.g. perception, planning, and
communication uncertainties. To address these, a novel deep reinforcement
learning-based autonomous cooperative planning (DRLACP) framework is proposed
to tackle various uncertainties on cooperative motion planning schemes.
Specifically, the soft actor-critic (SAC) with the implementation of gate
recurrent units (GRUs) is adopted to learn the deterministic optimal
time-varying actions with imperfect state information occurred by planning,
communication, and perception uncertainties. In addition, the real-time actions
of autonomous vehicles (AVs) are demonstrated via the Car Learning to Act
(CARLA) simulation platform. Evaluation results show that the proposed DRLACP
learns and performs cooperative planning effectively, which outperforms other
baseline methods under different scenarios with imperfect AV state information.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of enabling humanoid robots to interact with real-world environments combining lifelike motion and reliable scene perception.

Method: The method includes a simulation training pipeline using adversarial motion prior-based policy learning and a coarse-to-fine object localization module for real-world tasks.

Result: PhysHSI was validated in simulation and real-world tasks, showing high success rates, strong generalization, and lifelike motion patterns during activities such as carrying, sitting, and standing up.

Conclusion: PhysHSI demonstrates the potential to bridge the gap between simulation-trained models and practical real-world deployments for humanoid-scene interaction tasks.

Abstract: Deploying humanoid robots to interact with real-world environments--such as
carrying objects or sitting on chairs--requires generalizable, lifelike motions
and robust scene perception. Although prior approaches have advanced each
capability individually, combining them in a unified system is still an ongoing
challenge. In this work, we present a physical-world humanoid-scene interaction
system, PhysHSI, that enables humanoids to autonomously perform diverse
interaction tasks while maintaining natural and lifelike behaviors. PhysHSI
comprises a simulation training pipeline and a real-world deployment system. In
simulation, we adopt adversarial motion prior-based policy learning to imitate
natural humanoid-scene interaction data across diverse scenarios, achieving
both generalization and lifelike behaviors. For real-world deployment, we
introduce a coarse-to-fine object localization module that combines LiDAR and
camera inputs to provide continuous and robust scene perception. We validate
PhysHSI on four representative interactive tasks--box carrying, sitting, lying,
and standing up--in both simulation and real-world settings, demonstrating
consistently high success rates, strong generalization across diverse task
goals, and natural motion patterns.

TL;DR: Flow Planner introduces innovations in trajectory tokenization, model architecture, and learning techniques to enhance autonomous driving planning in interactive scenarios, achieving state-of-the-art results on large-scale datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving planning faces challenges in modeling interactive driving behaviors in complex scenarios, compounded by the scarcity of interactive driving data and limitations of conventional learning methods.

Method: The Flow Planner utilizes fine-grained trajectory tokenization, efficient spatiotemporal fusion in architecture, and a framework with flow matching and classifier-free guidance for multi-modal behavior generation.

Result: Flow Planner outperforms other learning-based approaches and effectively facilitates interactive behaviors in challenging scenarios, as evidenced by results on the nuPlan and interPlan datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework significantly advances learning-based planning by effectively addressing data modeling and interaction challenges, showcasing enhanced autonomous driving capabilities in complex environments.

Abstract: Modeling interactive driving behaviors in complex scenarios remains a
fundamental challenge for autonomous driving planning. Learning-based
approaches attempt to address this challenge with advanced generative models,
removing the dependency on over-engineered architectures for representation
fusion. However, brute-force implementation by simply stacking transformer
blocks lacks a dedicated mechanism for modeling interactive behaviors that are
common in real driving scenarios. The scarcity of interactive driving data
further exacerbates this problem, leaving conventional imitation learning
methods ill-equipped to capture high-value interactive behaviors. We propose
Flow Planner, which tackles these problems through coordinated innovations in
data modeling, model architecture, and learning scheme. Specifically, we first
introduce fine-grained trajectory tokenization, which decomposes the trajectory
into overlapping segments to decrease the complexity of whole trajectory
modeling. With a sophisticatedly designed architecture, we achieve efficient
temporal and spatial fusion of planning and scene information, to better
capture interactive behaviors. In addition, the framework incorporates flow
matching with classifier-free guidance for multi-modal behavior generation,
which dynamically reweights agent interactions during inference to maintain
coherent response strategies, providing a critical boost for interactive
scenario understanding. Experimental results on the large-scale nuPlan dataset
and challenging interactive interPlan dataset demonstrate that Flow Planner
achieves state-of-the-art performance among learning-based approaches while
effectively modeling interactive behaviors in complex driving scenarios.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a soft knee exoskeleton for rehabilitation control using a Deep Koopman Network and Model Predictive Control (MPC), outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a more wearable, safe, and effective robotic exoskeleton for stroke rehabilitation, addressing issues with traditional rigid and soft exoskeletons.

Method: A pneumatic, origami-inspired soft exoskeleton is developed, leveraging Deep Koopman Network for modeling human-robot interaction dynamics and MPC for control, with electromyography signals incorporated for better accuracy.

Result: The integration of EMG signals into the Koopman model enhances model accuracy significantly, and a personalized Koopman model performs better than a generic one, leading to superior control compared to PID control in training modes.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers an advanced and personalized soft rehabilitation robot control approach, improving both safety and efficiency for stroke recovery.

Abstract: Effective rehabilitation methods are essential for the recovery of lower limb
dysfunction caused by stroke. Nowadays, robotic exoskeletons have shown great
potentials in rehabilitation. Nevertheless, traditional rigid exoskeletons are
usually heavy and need a lot of work to help the patients to put them on.
Moreover, it also requires extra compliance control to guarantee the safety. In
contrast, soft exoskeletons are easy and comfortable to wear and have intrinsic
compliance, but their complex nonlinear human-robot interaction dynamics would
pose significant challenges for control. In this work, based on the pneumatic
actuators inspired by origami, we design a rehabilitation exoskeleton for knee
that is easy and comfortable to wear. To guarantee the control performance and
enable a nice human-robot interaction, we first use Deep Koopman Network to
model the human-robot interaction dynamics. In particular, by viewing the
electromyography (EMG) signals and the duty cycle of the PWM wave that controls
the pneumatic robot's valves and pump as the inputs, the linear Koopman model
accurately captures the complex human-robot interaction dynamics. Next, based
on the obtained Koopman model, we further use Model Predictive Control (MPC) to
control the soft robot and help the user to do rehabilitation training in
real-time. The goal of the rehabilitation training is to track a given
reference signal shown on the screen. Experiments show that by integrating the
EMG signals into the Koopman model, we have improved the model accuracy to
great extent. In addition, a personalized Koopman model trained from the
individual's own data performs better than the non-personalized model.
Consequently, our control framework outperforms the traditional PID control in
both passive and active training modes. Hence the proposed method provides a
new control framework for soft rehabilitation robots.

TL;DR: This study evaluates SO(3) action representations for robotics control tasks using three RL algorithms, exploring their impact on exploration, stability, and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of defining effective SO(3) action representations for robotic control tasks due to their non-trivial geometry.

Method: The paper systematically evaluates different SO(3) representations across PPO, SAC, and TD3 reinforcement learning algorithms in both dense and sparse reward environments using empirical studies.

Result: The study finds that the representation-induced geometry strongly impacts exploration, stability, and optimization. Tangent vectors in the local frame yield the best performance across algorithms.

Conclusion: Tangent vector representations in the local frame are recommended for reliable SO(3) actions, providing practical implementation guidelines.

Abstract: Many robotic control tasks require policies to act on orientations, yet the
geometry of SO(3) makes this nontrivial. Because SO(3) admits no global,
smooth, minimal parameterization, common representations such as Euler angles,
quaternions, rotation matrices, and Lie algebra coordinates introduce distinct
constraints and failure modes. While these trade-offs are well studied for
supervised learning, their implications for actions in reinforcement learning
remain unclear. We systematically evaluate SO(3) action representations across
three standard continuous control algorithms, PPO, SAC, and TD3, under dense
and sparse rewards. We compare how representations shape exploration, interact
with entropy regularization, and affect training stability through empirical
studies and analyze the implications of different projections for obtaining
valid rotations from Euclidean network outputs. Across a suite of robotics
benchmarks, we quantify the practical impact of these choices and distill
simple, implementation-ready guidelines for selecting and using rotation
actions. Our results highlight that representation-induced geometry strongly
influences exploration and optimization and show that representing actions as
tangent vectors in the local frame yields the most reliable results across
algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of achieving versatile loco-manipulation tasks for humanoid robots in human environments, with a focus on autonomy and generalization.

Method: DemoHLM employs a hierarchical framework combining a whole-body controller for motion commands and manipulation policies learned in simulation via synthetic data generation and imitation learning pipelines.

Result: Experiments demonstrate how increasing synthetic data improves policy performance, and real-world testing validates the framework's sim-to-real transferability on the Unitree G1 robot across ten tasks.

Conclusion: DemoHLM showcases effectiveness and robustness in leveraging simulation-driven policies to tackle loco-manipulation tasks on real humanoid robots, marking progress in generalizable robot autonomy.

Abstract: Loco-manipulation is a fundamental challenge for humanoid robots to achieve
versatile interactions in human environments. Although recent studies have made
significant progress in humanoid whole-body control, loco-manipulation remains
underexplored and often relies on hard-coded task definitions or costly
real-world data collection, which limits autonomy and generalization. We
present DemoHLM, a framework for humanoid loco-manipulation that enables
generalizable loco-manipulation on a real humanoid robot from a single
demonstration in simulation. DemoHLM adopts a hierarchy that integrates a
low-level universal whole-body controller with high-level manipulation policies
for multiple tasks. The whole-body controller maps whole-body motion commands
to joint torques and provides omnidirectional mobility for the humanoid robot.
The manipulation policies, learned in simulation via our data generation and
imitation learning pipeline, command the whole-body controller with closed-loop
visual feedback to execute challenging loco-manipulation tasks. Experiments
show a positive correlation between the amount of synthetic data and policy
performance, underscoring the effectiveness of our data generation pipeline and
the data efficiency of our approach. Real-world experiments on a Unitree G1
robot equipped with an RGB-D camera validate the sim-to-real transferability of
DemoHLM, demonstrating robust performance under spatial variations across ten
loco-manipulation tasks.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a rotor-failure-aware quadrotor navigation system that ensures stable autonomous flight in unknown, complex environments despite rotor failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rotor failures in quadrotors lead to significant instabilities during autonomous flight, particularly in unfamiliar environments. Current approaches lack comprehensive integration of detection, planning, and control for managing these failures in real-time.

Method: A composite approach combining failure detection and diagnosis (FDD) using a nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC), rotor-failure-aware spatial-temporal trajectory planning, and a quadrotor platform equipped with anti-torque plates and LiDAR for reliable perception.

Result: Experimental evaluation reveals superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, successfully enabling autonomous flight in environments such as cluttered rooms and unknown forests, even under challenging rotor failure scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed system demonstrates the feasibility, for the first time, of autonomous quadrotor navigation in complex settings despite rotor failures, emphasizing its robustness and practical applicability.

Abstract: Rotor failures in quadrotors may result in high-speed rotation and vibration
due to rotor imbalance, which introduces significant challenges for autonomous
flight in unknown environments. The mainstream approaches against rotor
failures rely on fault-tolerant control (FTC) and predefined trajectory
tracking. To the best of our knowledge, online failure detection and diagnosis
(FDD), trajectory planning, and FTC of the post-failure quadrotors in unknown
and complex environments have not yet been achieved. This paper presents a
rotor-failure-aware quadrotor navigation system designed to mitigate the
impacts of rotor imbalance. First, a composite FDD-based nonlinear model
predictive controller (NMPC), incorporating motor dynamics, is designed to
ensure fast failure detection and flight stability. Second, a
rotor-failure-aware planner is designed to leverage FDD results and
spatial-temporal joint optimization, while a LiDAR-based quadrotor platform
with four anti-torque plates is designed to enable reliable perception under
high-speed rotation. Lastly, extensive benchmarks against state-of-the-art
methods highlight the superior performance of the proposed approach in
addressing rotor failures, including propeller unloading and motor stoppage.
The experimental results demonstrate, for the first time, that our approach
enables autonomous quadrotor flight with rotor failures in challenging
environments, including cluttered rooms and unknown forests.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address challenges in robot person following in crowded environments due to frequent occlusions and limitations of existing simplistic methods.

Method: Developed a trajectory sampling method with socially aware zones and a multi-objective cost function, coupled with a prediction-aware MPPI controller for path tracking and collision prediction.

Result: Experiments demonstrated superior performance in terms of smoothness, safety, robustness, and human comfort, validated on a real-world mobile robot.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively overcomes occlusion challenges, enhances RPF capabilities, and is practical for real-world robotic applications.

Abstract: Robot person following (RPF) is a core capability in human-robot interaction,
enabling robots to assist users in daily activities, collaborative work, and
other service scenarios. However, achieving practical RPF remains challenging
due to frequent occlusions, particularly in dynamic and crowded environments.
Existing approaches often rely on fixed-point following or sparse
candidate-point selection with oversimplified heuristics, which cannot
adequately handle complex occlusions caused by moving obstacles such as
pedestrians. To address these limitations, we propose an adaptive trajectory
sampling method that generates dense candidate points within socially aware
zones and evaluates them using a multi-objective cost function. Based on the
optimal point, a person-following trajectory is estimated relative to the
predicted motion of the target. We further design a prediction-aware model
predictive path integral (MPPI) controller that simultaneously tracks this
trajectory and proactively avoids collisions using predicted pedestrian
motions. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in smoothness, safety, robustness, and human
comfort, with its effectiveness further demonstrated on a mobile robot in
real-world scenarios.

*Ruizhe Liu,Pei Zhou,Qian Luo,Li Sun,Jun Cen,Yibing Song,Yanchao Yang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a self-supervised system for robots to learn manipulation concepts from sensory data without human annotations, aiming to improve performance in diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable robots to generalize better across environments and tasks, leveraging invariant interaction patterns and minimizing reliance on human-provided annotations.

Method: A self-supervised approach combining cross-modal sensory correlation networks to find interaction patterns and multi-horizon predictors to learn temporal abstractions across scales.

Result: The framework shows significant improvements in robotic manipulation performance across simulated setups and real-world tasks, with concepts that align with human-interpretable manipulation despite no semantic labeling.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances robot representation learning and manipulation performance, bridging understanding between low-level actions and long-term goals without annotations.

Abstract: Effective generalization in robotic manipulation requires representations
that capture invariant patterns of interaction across environments and tasks.
We present a self-supervised framework for learning hierarchical manipulation
concepts that encode these invariant patterns through cross-modal sensory
correlations and multi-level temporal abstractions without requiring human
annotation. Our approach combines a cross-modal correlation network that
identifies persistent patterns across sensory modalities with a multi-horizon
predictor that organizes representations hierarchically across temporal scales.
Manipulation concepts learned through this dual structure enable policies to
focus on transferable relational patterns while maintaining awareness of both
immediate actions and longer-term goals. Empirical evaluation across simulated
benchmarks and real-world deployments demonstrates significant performance
improvements with our concept-enhanced policies. Analysis reveals that the
learned concepts resemble human-interpretable manipulation primitives despite
receiving no semantic supervision. This work advances both the understanding of
representation learning for manipulation and provides a practical approach to
enhancing robotic performance in complex scenarios.

Motivation: To address the challenge of enabling humanoid robots to perform industrial inspection tasks efficiently and precisely.

Method: Combines hierarchical planning (using inverse kinematics and mixed-integer programming), time-optimal standing position generation, and model predictive control with simplified kinematics.

Result: Simulation and experimental validation on Kuavo 4Pro humanoid demonstrated reduced time cost, high success rate, and millimeter-level precision in multi-location tasks.

Conclusion: The framework achieves efficient, precise, and reliable operation for industrial tasks, showcasing its potential in practical applications.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel framework for humanoid robots to execute
inspection tasks with high efficiency and millimeter-level precision. The
approach combines hierarchical planning, time-optimal standing position
generation, and integrated \ac{mpc} to achieve high speed and precision. A
hierarchical planning strategy, leveraging \ac{ik} and \ac{mip}, reduces
computational complexity by decoupling the high-dimensional planning problem. A
novel MIP formulation optimizes standing position selection and trajectory
length, minimizing task completion time. Furthermore, an MPC system with
simplified kinematics and single-step position correction ensures
millimeter-level end-effector tracking accuracy. Validated through simulations
and experiments on the Kuavo 4Pro humanoid platform, the framework demonstrates
low time cost and a high success rate in multi-location tasks, enabling

Abstract: This paper presents an AI-driven IoT robotic teleoperation system designed
for real-time remote manipulation and intelligent visual monitoring, tailored
for smart city applications. The architecture integrates a Flutter-based
cross-platform mobile interface with MQTT-based control signaling and WebRTC
video streaming via the LiveKit framework. A YOLOv11-nano model is deployed for

### [781] [A Faster and More Reliable Middleware for Autonomous Driving Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11448)
*Yuankai He,Hanlin Chen,Weisong Shi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents Sensor-in-Memory (SIM), a transport system designed for reducing latency in high-speed autonomous vehicles by using shared-memory transport and optimizing for data freshness. SIM reduces data-transport latency by up to 98%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the delays and inefficiencies caused by traditional ROS 2 middleware in high-speed autonomous vehicles, where rapid control loops and minimal latency are critical.

Method: The authors introduced SIM, a shared-memory transport system designed for intra-host pipelines. It uses native memory layouts, lock-free double buffers, and minimal integration efforts with ROS 2 nodes to prioritize data freshness and low latency.

Result: SIM demonstrated significant latency reductions, including up to 98% improvement in transport latency compared to ROS 2 zero-copy transports. It also improved the localization frequency and reduced perception-to-decision latency in a Level 4 autonomous vehicle.

Conclusion: SIM is highly effective in reducing transport latency, narrowing tail latencies, and improving localization frequency, which collectively enhance the safety and performance of autonomous vehicles under time-critical scenarios.

Abstract: Ensuring safety in high-speed autonomous vehicles requires rapid control
loops and tightly bounded delays from perception to actuation. Many open-source
autonomy systems rely on ROS 2 middleware; when multiple sensor and control
nodes share one compute unit, ROS 2 and its DDS transports add significant
(de)serialization, copying, and discovery overheads, shrinking the available
time budget. We present Sensor-in-Memory (SIM), a shared-memory transport
designed for intra-host pipelines in autonomous vehicles. SIM keeps sensor data
in native memory layouts (e.g., cv::Mat, PCL), uses lock-free bounded double
buffers that overwrite old data to prioritize freshness, and integrates into
ROS 2 nodes with four lines of code. Unlike traditional middleware, SIM
operates beside ROS 2 and is optimized for applications where data freshness
and minimal latency outweigh guaranteed completeness. SIM provides sequence
numbers, a writer heartbeat, and optional checksums to ensure ordering,
liveness, and basic integrity. On an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, SIM reduces
data-transport latency by up to 98% compared to ROS 2 zero-copy transports such
as FastRTPS and Zenoh, lowers mean latency by about 95%, and narrows
95th/99th-percentile tail latencies by around 96%. In tests on a
production-ready Level 4 vehicle running Autoware.Universe, SIM increased
localization frequency from 7.5 Hz to 9.5 Hz. Applied across all
latency-critical modules, SIM cut average perception-to-decision latency from
521.91 ms to 290.26 ms, reducing emergency braking distance at 40 mph (64 km/h)
on dry concrete by 13.6 ft (4.14 m).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work seeks to address challenges in aerial combat simulations such as imperfect situational awareness and nonlinear flight dynamics.

Method: A Hierarchical Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning framework that uses low-level policies for precise control and high-level policies for tactical commands, combined with techniques like curriculum learning, league-play, and a new training algorithm.

Result: Empirical results indicate enhanced learning efficiency and combat effectiveness in complex dogfight scenarios.

Conclusion: The hierarchical framework offers a promising solution for more effective decision-making and improved performance in aerial combat simulations.

Abstract: Achieving mission objectives in a realistic simulation of aerial combat is
highly challenging due to imperfect situational awareness and nonlinear flight
dynamics. In this work, we introduce a novel 3D multi-agent air combat
environment and a Hierarchical Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning framework to
tackle these challenges. Our approach combines heterogeneous agent dynamics,
curriculum learning, league-play, and a newly adapted training algorithm. To
this end, the decision-making process is organized into two abstraction levels:
low-level policies learn precise control maneuvers, while high-level policies
issue tactical commands based on mission objectives. Empirical results show
that our hierarchical approach improves both learning efficiency and combat
performance in complex dogfight scenarios.

*Murad Dawood,Usama Ahmed Siddiquie,Shahram Khorshidi,Maren Bennewitz*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a modular cost-aware regulator to improve safe reinforcement learning (RL), focusing on reducing unsafe behaviors during training by scaling actions based on predicted constraint violations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of combining reward optimization and safety constraints in RL, which often result in instability or require prior system knowledge.

Method: The authors introduce a cost-aware regulator module that modulates actions smoothly based on predicted constraint violations and avoids action suppression, seamlessly integrating it with off-policy RL methods like SAC and TD3.

Result: The approach achieved state-of-the-art performance in Safety Gym locomotion tasks, significantly reducing constraint violations (up to 126x) and substantially increasing returns compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: The proposed regulator presents a scalable and efficient solution for safe RL, enabling better balance between safety and task performance without overriding the policy or necessitating prior system knowledge.

Abstract: Safe reinforcement learning (RL) seeks to mitigate unsafe behaviors that
arise from exploration during training by reducing constraint violations while
maintaining task performance. Existing approaches typically rely on a single
policy to jointly optimize reward and safety, which can cause instability due
to conflicting objectives, or they use external safety filters that override
actions and require prior system knowledge. In this paper, we propose a modular
cost-aware regulator that scales the agent's actions based on predicted
constraint violations, preserving exploration through smooth action modulation
rather than overriding the policy. The regulator is trained to minimize
constraint violations while avoiding degenerate suppression of actions. Our
approach integrates seamlessly with off-policy RL methods such as SAC and TD3,
and achieves state-of-the-art return-to-cost ratios on Safety Gym locomotion
tasks with sparse costs, reducing constraint violations by up to 126 times
while increasing returns by over an order of magnitude compared to prior
methods.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dual-quaternion-based NMPC framework for quadrotor flight, improving dynamic control, accuracy, and reliability in complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of achieving precise control in agile quadrotor flights, which is hampered by their underactuated design and coupled dynamics.

Method: The authors propose a novel Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) framework that uses dual-quaternions to directly represent quadrotor dynamics and pose errors, leading to a compact and globally non-singular formulation.

Result: The proposed framework demonstrates improved numerical conditioning and drastically enhances tracking performance, showing up to 56.11% and 56.77% reductions in position and orientation errors compared to conventional methods. Additionally, it enables successful handling of aggressive trajectories that traditional controllers fail to manage.

Conclusion: The dual-quaternion-based NMPC provides a more effective and robust control strategy for quadrotor flight, especially in complex and confined spaces.

Abstract: MAVs have great potential to assist humans in complex tasks, with
applications ranging from logistics to emergency response. Their agility makes
them ideal for operations in complex and dynamic environments. However,
achieving precise control in agile flights remains a significant challenge,
particularly due to the underactuated nature of quadrotors and the strong
coupling between their translational and rotational dynamics. In this work, we
propose a novel NMPC framework based on dual-quaternions (DQ-NMPC) for
quadrotor flight. By representing both quadrotor dynamics and the pose error
directly on the dual-quaternion manifold, our approach enables a compact and
globally non-singular formulation that captures the quadrotor coupled dynamics.
We validate our approach through simulations and real-world experiments,
demonstrating better numerical conditioning and significantly improved tracking
performance, with reductions in position and orientation errors of up to 56.11%
and 56.77%, compared to a conventional baseline NMPC method. Furthermore, our
controller successfully handles aggressive trajectories, reaching maximum
speeds up to 13.66 m/s and accelerations reaching 4.2 g within confined space
conditions of dimensions 11m x 4.5m x 3.65m under which the baseline controller
fails.

TL;DR: The paper introduces IntersectioNDE, a data-driven simulator addressing challenges in modeling dense, heterogeneous traffic interactions at urban intersections, particularly in regions like China. It also proposes a novel Interaction Decoupling Strategy (IDS) to improve simulation stability using the new CiCross Dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing traffic simulators struggle with accurately modeling dense and diverse interactions at urban intersections, which are commonplace in regions like China, and face challenges like mode collapse and instability in high-density environments.

Method: The authors introduce the CiCross Dataset capturing real-world urban intersection interactions and propose IntersectioNDE, using the Interaction Decoupling Strategy (IDS) within a scene-aware Transformer network to enhance simulation fidelity and stability.

Result: The IntersectioNDE simulator outperformed baseline methods in terms of simulation fidelity, long-term stability, and ability to replicate urban traffic dynamics in high-density conditions.

Conclusion: IntersectioNDE and CiCross together offer robust tools for realistic traffic simulation in complex urban scenarios, addressing a critical need for autonomous vehicle development.

Abstract: Realistic traffic simulation is critical for ensuring the safety and
reliability of autonomous vehicles (AVs), especially in complex and diverse
urban traffic environments. However, existing data-driven simulators face two
key challenges: a limited focus on modeling dense, heterogeneous interactions
at urban intersections - which are prevalent, crucial, and practically
significant in countries like China, featuring diverse agents including
motorized vehicles (MVs), non-motorized vehicles (NMVs), and pedestrians - and
the inherent difficulty in robustly learning high-dimensional joint
distributions for such high-density scenes, often leading to mode collapse and
long-term simulation instability. We introduce City Crossings Dataset
(CiCross), a large-scale dataset collected from a real-world urban
intersection, uniquely capturing dense, heterogeneous multi-agent interactions,
particularly with a substantial proportion of MVs, NMVs and pedestrians. Based
on this dataset, we propose IntersectioNDE (Intersection Naturalistic Driving
Environment), a data-driven simulator tailored for complex urban intersection
scenarios. Its core component is the Interaction Decoupling Strategy (IDS), a
training paradigm that learns compositional dynamics from agent subsets,
enabling the marginal-to-joint simulation. Integrated into a scene-aware
Transformer network with specialized training techniques, IDS significantly
enhances simulation robustness and long-term stability for modeling
heterogeneous interactions. Experiments on CiCross show that IntersectioNDE
outperforms baseline methods in simulation fidelity, stability, and its ability
to replicate complex, distribution-level urban traffic dynamics.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a bi-level optimization framework for calibrating covariance matrices and kinematic parameters to improve state estimation for legged and aerial robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State estimation in dynamic and uncertain environments is critical, but it faces challenges due to unknown or manually tuned process and measurement noise covariances.

Method: A bi-level optimization framework, where the upper level optimizes noise covariances and kinematic parameters, and the lower level runs a full-information estimator, leveraging differentiation through the estimator to optimize trajectory-level objectives.

Result: The proposed approach significantly improves estimation accuracy and uncertainty calibration compared to hand-tuned baselines on quadrupedal and humanoid robots.

Conclusion: The method provides a unified, data-driven framework that integrates state estimation, sensor, and kinematics calibration, making it versatile for diverse robotic platforms.

Abstract: Accurate state estimation is critical for legged and aerial robots operating
in dynamic, uncertain environments. A key challenge lies in specifying process
and measurement noise covariances, which are typically unknown or manually
tuned. In this work, we introduce a bi-level optimization framework that
jointly calibrates covariance matrices and kinematic parameters in an
estimator-in-the-loop manner. The upper level treats noise covariances and
model parameters as optimization variables, while the lower level executes a
full-information estimator. Differentiating through the estimator allows direct
optimization of trajectory-level objectives, resulting in accurate and
consistent state estimates. We validate our approach on quadrupedal and
humanoid robots, demonstrating significantly improved estimation accuracy and
uncertainty calibration compared to hand-tuned baselines. Our method unifies
state estimation, sensor, and kinematics calibration into a principled,
data-driven framework applicable across diverse robotic platforms.

TL;DR: The paper introduces NaviGait, a framework combining trajectory optimization and reinforcement learning (RL) for robust and intuitive bipedal locomotion control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in designing robust locomotion control policies for bipedal robots, including unintuitive reward design in RL and brittleness of trajectory optimization methods.

Method: The framework integrates offline trajectory optimization methods for structured motion plans with RL for adaptability and stability. It interpolates between optimized gaits and uses RL policy corrections.

Result: NaviGait achieves faster training than conventional RL and imitation-based methods, and generates motions that closely resemble optimized references.

Conclusion: By combining trajectory optimization and RL, NaviGait offers a scalable and robust approach to dynamic locomotion with reduced complexity in reward design.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful method to learn robust
control policies for bipedal locomotion. Yet, it can be difficult to tune
desired robot behaviors due to unintuitive and complex reward design. In
comparison, offline trajectory optimization methods, like Hybrid Zero Dynamics,
offer more tuneable, interpretable, and mathematically grounded motion plans
for high-dimensional legged systems. However, these methods often remain
brittle to real-world disturbances like external perturbations.
  In this work, we present NaviGait, a hierarchical framework that combines the
structure of trajectory optimization with the adaptability of RL for robust and
intuitive locomotion control. NaviGait leverages a library of offline-optimized
gaits and smoothly interpolates between them to produce continuous reference
motions in response to high-level commands. The policy provides both
joint-level and velocity command residual corrections to modulate and stabilize
the reference trajectories in the gait library. One notable advantage of
NaviGait is that it dramatically simplifies reward design by encoding rich
motion priors from trajectory optimization, reducing the need for finely tuned
shaping terms and enabling more stable and interpretable learning. Our
experimental results demonstrate that NaviGait enables faster training compared
to conventional and imitation-based RL, and produces motions that remain
closest to the original reference. Overall, by decoupling high-level motion
generation from low-level correction, NaviGait offers a more scalable and
generalizable approach for achieving dynamic and robust locomotion.

Motivation: Educational robotics are flourishing due to accessible components and allow students to explore theoretical problems practically. However, current kits focus mainly on egocentric robot perception, limiting high-level learning.

Method: The authors developed a holonomous robot kit equipped with an external tracking system to overcome embedded constraints and allow exploration of advanced robotics topics.

Result: This approach enables learning of coordinate systems, navigation, and high-level robotics without being limited by hardware constraints.

Conclusion: By introducing external tracking, educational robotics can transcend traditional limitations, providing a richer educational context and problem-solving opportunities.

Abstract: Recent developments of low cost off-the-shelf programmable components, their

it is accessible in most schools today. They allow to illustrate and embody
theoretical problems in practical and tangible applications, and gather
multidisciplinary skills. They also give a rich natural context for

Conclusion: SCOOP'D shows effectiveness for robotic scooping in diverse real-world settings, outperforming baseline approaches and offering a promising direction for these robotic systems.

Abstract: Scooping items with tools such as spoons and ladles is common in daily life,
ranging from assistive feeding to retrieving items from environmental disaster
sites. However, developing a general and autonomous robotic scooping policy is
challenging since it requires reasoning about complex tool-object interactions.
Furthermore, scooping often involves manipulating deformable objects, such as
granular media or liquids, which is challenging due to their
infinite-dimensional configuration spaces and complex dynamics. We propose a
method, SCOOP'D, which uses simulation from OmniGibson (built on NVIDIA
Omniverse) to collect scooping demonstrations using algorithmic procedures that
rely on privileged state information. Then, we use generative policies via
diffusion to imitate demonstrations from observational input. We directly apply
the learned policy in diverse real-world scenarios, testing its performance on
various item quantities, item characteristics, and container types. In
zero-shot deployment, our method demonstrates promising results across 465
trials in diverse scenarios, including objects of different difficulty levels
that we categorize as "Level 1" and "Level 2." SCOOP'D outperforms all

Motivation: The authors aim to enable advanced automation in heavy machinery by accurately and efficiently estimating end effector forces, thereby enhancing precision in grading and digging operations.

Method: The paper introduces a retrofittable and minimally calibrated 2D force- and payload estimation algorithm built upon a dynamic model. The system combines optimization-based payload estimation techniques with measurements from pressure and inertial sensors.

Result: Their approach achieves a payload estimation accuracy of 1%, direction accuracy of 13 degrees, and magnitude accuracy of 383 N. The results are validated across two different excavator platforms, outperforming traditional methods and commercial systems.

Conclusion: The proposed system enhances both accuracy and precision for force and payload estimation in excavators, demonstrating its potential for broader application in heavy machinery automation.

Abstract: Accurate real-time estimation of end effector interaction forces in hydraulic
excavators is a key enabler for advanced automation in heavy machinery.
Accurate knowledge of these forces allows improved, precise grading and digging
maneuvers. To address these challenges, we introduce a high-accuracy,
retrofittable 2D force- and payload estimation algorithm that does not impose
additional requirements on the operator regarding trajectory, acceleration or
the use of the slew joint. The approach is designed for retrofittability,
requires minimal calibration and no prior knowledge of machine-specific dynamic
characteristics. Specifically, we propose a method for identifying a dynamic
model, necessary to estimate both end effector interaction forces and bucket
payload during normal operation. Our optimization-based payload estimation
achieves a full-scale payload accuracy of 1%. On a standard 25 t excavator, the
online force measurement from pressure and inertial measurements achieves a
direction accuracy of 13 degree and a magnitude accuracy of 383 N. The method's
accuracy and generalization capability are validated on two excavator platforms
of different type and weight classes. We benchmark our payload estimation
against a classical quasistatic method and a commercially available system. Our
system outperforms both in accuracy and precision.

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel framework for contact-aware humanoid robotics leveraging a learned world model with Model Predictive Control (MPC), achieving enhanced autonomy, robustness, and multi-task capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous humanoid robots face challenges in unstructured environments, particularly in exploiting physical contact rather than avoiding it. Current approaches struggle with contact complexity and inefficiencies in learning.

Method: The approach combines a learned world model trained on offline data with sampling-based MPC in a latent predictive space. Additionally, a surrogate value function is introduced for robust planning under sparse rewards and sensor noise.

Result: The proposed system successfully handles diverse contact-aware tasks like perturbation recovery, object blocking, and constrained traversal. It improves data efficiency and multi-task ability compared to on-policy RL approaches.

Conclusion: The framework enhances humanoid robot autonomy by enabling robust contact planning using proprioception and depth images, showcasing practical deployment with scalability and real-time performance.

Abstract: Enabling humanoid robots to exploit physical contact, rather than simply
avoid collisions, is crucial for autonomy in unstructured environments.
Traditional optimization-based planners struggle with contact complexity, while
on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) is sample-inefficient and has limited
multi-task ability. We propose a framework combining a learned world model with
sampling-based Model Predictive Control (MPC), trained on a demonstration-free
offline dataset to predict future outcomes in a compressed latent space. To
address sparse contact rewards and sensor noise, the MPC uses a learned
surrogate value function for dense, robust planning. Our single, scalable model
supports contact-aware tasks, including wall support after perturbation,
blocking incoming objects, and traversing height-limited arches, with improved
data efficiency and multi-task capability over on-policy RL. Deployed on a
physical humanoid, our system achieves robust, real-time contact planning from
proprioception and ego-centric depth images. Website:

*Maggie Wang,Stephen Tian,Aiden Swann,Ola Shorinwa,Jiajun Wu,Mac Schwager*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Phys2Real, a real-to-sim-to-real RL pipeline, uses vision-language models and interactive adaptation to enhance robotic manipulation in tasks requiring precise dynamics, achieving better performance than traditional domain randomization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing RL policies directly in the real world can be costly and slow, while simulated environments struggle with effective sim-to-real transfer in dynamics-critical robotic tasks.

Method: Phys2Real combines high-fidelity geometric reconstruction via 3D Gaussian splatting, vision-language model-based parameter estimation, and online physical parameter adaptation using ensemble uncertainty quantification.

Result: Phys2Real significantly outperformed a domain randomization baseline in tasks involving precise dynamics, achieving higher success rates and faster task completion in planar pushing tasks.

Conclusion: Incorporating VLM-inferred physical parameter estimation with online adaptation enables more effective sim-to-real transfer for robotics, showing that combining interaction feedback with model-based priors is critical for success.

Abstract: Learning robotic manipulation policies directly in the real world can be
expensive and time-consuming. While reinforcement learning (RL) policies
trained in simulation present a scalable alternative, effective sim-to-real
transfer remains challenging, particularly for tasks that require precise
dynamics. To address this, we propose Phys2Real, a real-to-sim-to-real RL
pipeline that combines vision-language model (VLM)-inferred physical parameter
estimates with interactive adaptation through uncertainty-aware fusion. Our
approach consists of three core components: (1) high-fidelity geometric
reconstruction with 3D Gaussian splatting, (2) VLM-inferred prior distributions
over physical parameters, and (3) online physical parameter estimation from
interaction data. Phys2Real conditions policies on interpretable physical
parameters, refining VLM predictions with online estimates via ensemble-based
uncertainty quantification. On planar pushing tasks of a T-block with varying
center of mass (CoM) and a hammer with an off-center mass distribution,
Phys2Real achieves substantial improvements over a domain randomization
baseline: 100% vs 79% success rate for the bottom-weighted T-block, 57% vs 23%
in the challenging top-weighted T-block, and 15% faster average task completion
for hammer pushing. Ablation studies indicate that the combination of VLM and
interaction information is essential for success. Project website:

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper surveys LLMs' impact on software engineering, offering a taxonomy of solutions and benchmarks, presenting a unified workflow, and highlighting research gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of understanding of benchmarks and solutions in LLM-based software engineering, hindering systematic progress and evaluation.

Method: Analyzed 150+ papers, created taxonomy covering solutions (prompt-based, fine-tuning-based, agent-based) and benchmarks (code generation, translation, etc.), and proposed a unified pipeline.

Result: Showed how the field evolved from simple prompting to complex agent systems, connected benchmarks to solution strategies, and uncovered research gaps.

Conclusion: The survey offers comprehensive coverage and actionable directions, serving as a foundational resource for advancing LLM-based software engineering.

Abstract: The integration of LLMs into software engineering has catalyzed a paradigm
shift from traditional rule-based systems to sophisticated agentic systems
capable of autonomous problem-solving. Despite this transformation, the field
lacks a comprehensive understanding of how benchmarks and solutions
interconnect, hindering systematic progress and evaluation. This survey
presents the first holistic analysis of LLM-empowered software engineering,
bridging the critical gap between evaluation and solution approaches. We
analyze 150+ recent papers and organize them into a comprehensive taxonomy
spanning two major dimensions: (1) Solutions, categorized into prompt-based,
fine-tuning-based, and agent-based paradigms, and (2) Benchmarks, covering code
generation, translation, repair, and other tasks. Our analysis reveals how the
field has evolved from simple prompt engineering to complex agentic systems
incorporating planning and decomposition, reasoning and self-refinement, memory
mechanisms, and tool augmentation. We present a unified pipeline that
illustrates the complete workflow from task specification to final
deliverables, demonstrating how different solution paradigms address varying
complexity levels across software engineering tasks. Unlike existing surveys
that focus on isolated aspects, we provide full-spectrum coverage connecting
50+ benchmarks with their corresponding solution strategies, enabling
researchers to identify optimal approaches for specific evaluation criteria.
Furthermore, we identify critical research gaps and propose actionable future
directions, including multi-agent collaboration frameworks, self-evolving code
generation systems, and integration of formal verification with LLM-based
methods. This survey serves as a foundational resource for researchers and
practitioners seeking to understand, evaluate, and advance LLM-empowered
software engineering systems.

*Qiaosheng Chen,Yang Liu,Lei Li,Kai Chen,Qipeng Guo,Gong Cheng,Fei Yuan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces InteractScience, a benchmark designed to assess Large Language Models' ability to integrate scientific knowledge with interactive front-end coding, an area beyond the capabilities of existing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate and advance Large Language Models' capabilities in generating accurate, interactive scientific demonstrations for educational and research purposes.

Method: The authors developed a hybrid framework combining functional tests for interaction logic and qualitative tests for visual correctness, and presented a benchmark with structured questions, unit tests, snapshots, and checklists across five scientific domains.

Result: 30 prominent LLMs were evaluated, highlighting current deficiencies in integrating domain-specific knowledge with interactive coding capabilities.

Conclusion: InteractScience is positioned as the first benchmark that rigorously evaluates LLMs' ability to combine scientific knowledge and interactive coding, paving the way for more reliable educational tools.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly capable of generating complete
applications from natural language instructions, creating new opportunities in
science and education. In these domains, interactive scientific demonstrations
are particularly valuable for explaining concepts, supporting new teaching
methods, and presenting research findings. Generating such demonstrations
requires models to combine accurate scientific knowledge with the ability to
implement interactive front-end code that behaves correctly and responds to
user actions. This capability goes beyond the scope of existing benchmarks,
which typically evaluate either knowledge question answering without grounding
in code or static web code generation without scientific interactivity. To
evaluate this integrated ability, we design a hybrid framework that combines
programmatic functional testing to rigorously verify interaction logic with
visually-grounded qualitative testing to assess rendered outputs against
reference snapshots. Building on this framework, we present InteractScience, a
benchmark consisting of a substantial set of carefully designed questions
across five scientific domains, each paired with unit tests, reference
snapshots, and checklists. We evaluate 30 leading open- and closed-source LLMs
and report results that highlight ongoing weaknesses in integrating domain
knowledge with interactive front-end coding. Our work positions InteractScience
as the first benchmark to automatically measure this combined capability with
realistic interactive operations, providing a foundation for advancing reliable
and educationally useful scientific demonstration code generation. All code and
data are publicly available at https://github.com/open-compass/InteractScience.

*Muhammad Maaz,Liam DeVoe,Zac Hatfield-Dodds,Nicholas Carlini*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces an LLM-based agent to autonomously perform property-based testing (PBT) on Python modules, demonstrating its effectiveness by detecting diverse bugs and generating actionable bug reports.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve software testing methods by leveraging LLMs to autonomously identify bugs and generate effective bug reports, making the process scalable and rigorous.

Method: An LLM-based agent analyzes Python modules, infers properties from code/documentation, synthesizes/executed PBTs, and confirms bugs by reflecting on outputs. It generates actionable bug reports and ranks bugs based on their priority.

Result: Out of 100 Python packages tested, 56% of the bugs identified were valid, and 32% were noteworthy enough to report. For the 21 top-ranked bugs, 86% were valid and 81% were reported. The framework identified various failure types and successfully submitted bug fixes, some of which were merged.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates that LLMs paired with PBT can autonomously test software rigorously and effectively, identifying diverse bugs and contributing valid fixes to popular packages.

Abstract: Property-based testing (PBT) is a lightweight formal method, typically
implemented as a randomized testing framework. Users specify the input domain
for their test using combinators supplied by the PBT framework, and the
expected properties or invariants as a unit-test function. The framework then
searches for a counterexample, e.g. by generating inputs and calling the test
function. In this work, we demonstrate an LLM-based agent which analyzes Python
modules, infers function-specific and cross-function properties from code and
documentation, synthesizes and executes PBTs, reflects on outputs of these
tests to confirm true bugs, and finally outputs actionable bug reports for the
developer. We perform an extensive evaluation of our agent across 100 popular
Python packages. Of the bug reports generated by the agent, we found after
manual review that 56\% were valid bugs and 32\% were valid bugs that we would
report to maintainers. We then developed a ranking rubric to surface
high-priority valid bugs to developers, and found that of the 21 top-scoring
bugs, 86\% were valid and 81\% we would report. The bugs span diverse failure
modes from serialization failures to numerical precision errors to flawed cache
implementations. We reported 5 bugs, 4 with patches, including to NumPy and
cloud computing SDKs, with 3 patches merged successfully. Our results suggest
that LLMs with PBT provides a rigorous and scalable method for autonomously
testing software. Our code and artifacts are available at:

### [797] [OFP-Repair: Repairing Floating-point Errors via Original-Precision Arithmetic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09938)
*Youshuai Tan,Zishuo Ding,Jinfu Chen,Weiyi Shang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Errors in floating-point computations can lead to critical consequences. Current repair tools are either resource-intensive or limited in scope. The paper introduces OFP-Repair, a novel method capable of distinguishing and addressing original-precision repairable errors effectively, validated through experimental results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Critical domains suffer from errors in floating-point operations, which are difficult to efficiently differentiate and repair using existing tools. This research aims to alleviate this precision-repair dilemma.

Method: The paper presents OFP-Repair, a tool designed to address floating-point errors by distinguishing between those repairable at original precision and those requiring high precision, while validating its effectiveness using real-world datasets and bug reports.

Result: OFP-Repair achieves remarkable accuracy improvements and error detection rates compared to existing tools like ACESO. It demonstrated its capability by successfully repairing historical bugs in the GNU Scientific Library, showing developer interest and practical relevance.

Conclusion: The proposed method, OFP-Repair, surpasses existing solutions in accurately identifying and fixing original-precision errors, suggesting its potential for integration into development workflows and expanding its applicability for repairing floating-point bugs.

Abstract: Errors in floating-point programs can lead to severe consequences,
particularly in critical domains such as military, aerospace, and financial
systems, making their repair a crucial research problem. In practice, some
errors can be fixed using original-precision arithmetic, while others require
high-precision computation. Developers often avoid addressing the latter due to
excessive computational resources required. However, they sometimes struggle to
distinguish between these two types of errors, and existing repair tools fail
to assist in this differentiation. Most current repair tools rely on
high-precision implementations, which are time-consuming to develop and demand
specialized expertise. Although a few tools do not require high-precision
programs, they can only fix a limited subset of errors or produce suboptimal
results.
  To address these challenges, we propose a novel method, named OFP-Repair.On
ACESO's dataset, our patches achieve improvements of three, seven, three, and
eight orders of magnitude across four accuracy metrics. In real-world cases,
our method successfully detects all five original-precision-repairable errors
and fixes three, whereas ACESO only repairs one. Notably, these results are
based on verified data and do not fully capture the potential of OFP-Repair. To
further validate our method, we deploy it on a decade-old open bug report from
GNU Scientific Library (GSL), successfully repairing five out of 15 bugs. The
developers have expressed interest in our method and are considering
integrating our tool into their development workflow. We are currently working
on applying our patches to GSL. The results are highly encouraging,
demonstrating the practical applicability of our technique.

*Stefan Pasch*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study examines the impact of Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) practices on user satisfaction by analyzing over 8,000 reviews, showing a generally positive impact while highlighting organizational context differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is limited empirical evidence on whether MLOps practices effectively support AI application development and operations, motivating an investigation into their impact.

Method: The study utilizes zero-shot classification to analyze sentiment in 8,000 user reviews for nine MLOps practices, such as CI/CD, workflow orchestration, reproducibility, and monitoring.

Result: Seven out of nine MLOps practices show a significant positive relationship with user satisfaction, highlighting their value in AI development irrespective of firm size.

Conclusion: MLOps practices offer clear benefits across organizational contexts, but the frequency of their discussion varies by firm size. Their implementation is universally seen as advantageous.

Abstract: Organizational efforts to utilize and operationalize artificial intelligence
(AI) are often accompanied by substantial challenges, including scalability,
maintenance, and coordination across teams. In response, the concept of Machine
Learning Operations (MLOps) has emerged as a set of best practices that
integrate software engineering principles with the unique demands of managing
the ML lifecycle. Yet, empirical evidence on whether and how these practices
support users in developing and operationalizing AI applications remains
limited. To address this gap, this study analyzes over 8,000 user reviews of AI
development platforms from G2.com. Using zero-shot classification, we measure
review sentiment toward nine established MLOps practices, including continuous
integration and delivery (CI/CD), workflow orchestration, reproducibility,
versioning, collaboration, and monitoring. Seven of the nine practices show a
significant positive relationship with user satisfaction, suggesting that
effective MLOps implementation contributes tangible value to AI development.
However, organizational context also matters: reviewers from small firms
discuss certain MLOps practices less frequently, suggesting that organizational
context influences the prevalence and salience of MLOps, though firm size does
not moderate the MLOps-satisfaction link. This indicates that once applied,
MLOps practices are perceived as universally beneficial across organizational
settings.

*Matheus J. T. Vargas*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: SLEAN is a simple framework for orchestrating multiple AI systems to improve the quality and reliability of their outputs, especially in software debugging, using basic text prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address harmful AI-generated code suggestions which introduce unnecessary complexity or break existing functionality during debugging.

Method: It uses a three-phase protocol: independent analysis, cross-critique, and arbitration, with minimal .txt-based templates for coordination between multiple AI systems.

Result: Evaluated on 15 bugs with 69 AI-generated fixes, SLEAN filtered harmful suggestions, accepting 31.9% and reducing code change surface by 83-90%. Simpler input prompts improved efficiency by about 20%.

Conclusion: SLEAN provides a lightweight and provider-agnostic framework for reliable synthesis and auditing across multiple domains without requiring specialized infrastructure.

Abstract: We present SLEAN (Simple Lightweight Ensemble Analysis Network), a
deterministic framework for coordinating multiple LLM providers through
text-based prompt orchestration. Unlike complex multi-agent systems requiring
specialized infrastructure, SLEAN operates as a simple prompt bridge between
LLMs using .txt templates, requiring no deep technical knowledge for
deployment. The three-phase protocol formed by independent analysis,
cross-critique, and arbitration, filters harmful AI-generated code suggestions
before production deployment, addressing how AI-assisted debugging increasingly
produces modifications that introduce unnecessary complexity, break existing
functionality, or address problems. Evaluating 15 software bugs, we analyzed 69
AI-generated fix propositions. SLEAN's filtering accepted 22 fixes (31.9%, 95%
CI 20.9-42.9%) while rejecting 47 that would have been harmful if applied
verbatim. The arbitration process reduced code change surface by 83-90%
relative to raw AI outputs, enforcing minimal causal edits over scope-expanding
modifications. Minimal Type 2 inputs proved more efficient than detailed Type 1
inputs, requiring 2.85 versus 3.56 propositions per accepted fix (35.1% versus
28.1% acceptance, about a 20% efficiency gain). Agreement between AI systems
showed weak correlation with fix quality: high convergence (at least 80%)
occurred in 4 of 15 cases and improved acceptance by only 2.4% points;
arbitration appeared only at exactly 10% convergence in 2 of 15 cases, although
low convergence alone did not necessitate arbitration. The file-driven,
provider-agnostic architecture enables deployment without specialized coding
expertise, making it applicable to security auditing, code review, document
verification, and other domains requiring reliable multi-provider synthesis
with end-to-end auditability.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper integrates the Nykiö change detection service with MooBench to improve performance change detection in GitHub projects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Performance changes in GitHub projects are important to users, yet effective detection of these changes remains challenging.

Method: The authors enhanced the MooBench framework by uploading performance data to the Nykiö change detection service, enabling identification and depth analysis of performance changes.

Result: The integration successfully identified a major performance regression, linked reproducibly to a Linux Kernel version change using GitHub actions.

Conclusion: Performance regression detection was improved by integrating Nykiö with MooBench, highlighting gaps in current GitHub CI/CD tools for detecting such changes.

Abstract: In GitHub with its 518 million hosted projects, performance changes within
these projects are highly relevant to the project's users. Although performance
measurement is supported by GitHub CI/CD, performance change detection is a
challenging topic.
  In this paper, we demonstrate how we incorporated Nyrki\"o to MooBench. Prior
to this work, Moobench continuously ran on GitHub virtual machines, measuring
overhead of tracing agents, but without change detection. By adding the upload
of the measurements to the Nyrki\"o change detection service, we made it
possible to detect performance changes. We identified one major performance
regression and examined the performance change in depth. We report that (1) it
is reproducible with GitHub actions, and (2) the performance regression is
caused by a Linux Kernel version change.

*Shan Jiang,Chenguang Zhu,Sarfraz Khurshid*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: OBsmith is a framework that tests JavaScript obfuscators for correctness using large language models (LLMs) to uncover bugs that compromise program semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the overlooked issue of program semantics preservation in JavaScript obfuscators, which can lead to altered functionality, reliability issues, and eroded security.

Method: OBsmith systematically validates obfuscators by generating test programs using LLMs and extracting program sketches from real code. These programs are then tested under various obfuscation configurations.

Result: OBsmith identified 11 previously unknown bugs in JavaScript obfuscators that were missed by five state-of-the-art fuzzers, proving its effectiveness in exposing obfuscator-specific issues.

Conclusion: OBsmith serves as a significant tool for ensuring the correctness and reliability of JavaScript obfuscators, positioning itself as a complement to existing fuzzing tools and providing insights into balancing obfuscation with performance.

Abstract: JavaScript obfuscators are widely deployed to protect intellectual property
and resist reverse engineering, yet their correctness has been largely
overlooked compared to performance and resilience. Existing evaluations
typically measure resistance to deobfuscation, leaving the critical question of
whether obfuscators preserve program semantics unanswered. Incorrect
transformations can silently alter functionality, compromise reliability, and
erode security-undermining the very purpose of obfuscation. To address this
gap, we present OBsmith, a novel framework to systematically test JavaScript
obfuscators using large language models (LLMs). OBsmith leverages LLMs to
generate program sketches abstract templates capturing diverse language
constructs, idioms, and corner cases-which are instantiated into executable
programs and subjected to obfuscation under different configurations. Besides
LLM-powered sketching, OBsmith also employs a second source: automatic
extraction of sketches from real programs. This extraction path enables more
focused testing of project specific features and lets developers inject domain
knowledge into the resulting test cases. OBsmith uncovers 11 previously unknown
correctness bugs. Under an equal program budget, five general purpose
state-of-the-art JavaScript fuzzers (FuzzJIT, Jsfunfuzz, Superion, DIE,
Fuzzilli) failed to detect these issues, highlighting OBsmith's complementary
focus on obfuscation induced misbehavior. An ablation shows that all components
except our generic MRs contribute to at least one bug class; the negative MR
result suggests the need for obfuscator-specific metamorphic relations. Our
results also seed discussion on how to balance obfuscation presets and
performance cost. We envision OBsmith as an important step towards automated
testing and quality assurance of obfuscators and other semantic-preserving
toolchains.

### [802] [A Mathematics-Guided Approach to Floating-Point Error Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10081)
*Youshuai Tan,Zhanwei Zhang,Zishuo Ding,Lianyu Zheng,Jinfu Chen,Weiyi Shang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes MGDE, a method based on mathematical guidance for detecting floating-point errors faster and more effectively than traditional approaches like FPCC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Floating-point errors can result in significant consequences in critical fields, and detecting inputs causing such errors is a computational challenge due to inefficiencies and high costs of current methods.

Method: The MGDE approach uses the Newton-Raphson method for error detection, leveraging its quadratic convergence to efficiently identify error-inducing inputs.

Result: MGDE detected 89 bugs in 44 programs compared to FPCC's 48 bugs in 29 programs. MGDE is 6.4x faster for single-input programs and effective for multi-input programs, unlike FPCC.

Conclusion: MGDE outperforms FPCC in both efficiency and bug detection for floating-point programs, making it a promising solution for addressing computational shortcomings in error identification.

Abstract: Floating-point program errors can lead to severe consequences, particularly
in critical domains such as military applications. Only a small subset of
inputs may induce substantial floating-point errors, prompting researchers to
develop methods for identifying these error-inducing inputs. Although existing
approaches have achieved some success, they still suffer from two major
limitations: (1) High computational cost: The evaluation of error magnitude for
candidate inputs relies on high-precision programs, which are prohibitively
time-consuming. (2) Limited long-range convergence capability: Current methods
exhibit inefficiency in search, making the process akin to finding a needle in
a haystack.
  To address these two limitations, we propose a novel method, named MGDE, to
detect error-inducing inputs based on mathematical guidance. By employing the
Newton-Raphson method, which exhibits quadratic convergence properties, we
achieve highly effective and efficient results. Since the goal of identifying
error-inducing inputs is to uncover the underlying bugs, we use the number of
bugs detected in floating-point programs as the primary evaluation metric in
our experiments. As FPCC represents the most effective state-of-the-art
approach to date, we use it as the baseline for comparison. The dataset of FPCC
consists of 88 single-input floating-point programs. FPCC is able to detect 48
bugs across 29 programs, whereas our method successfully identifies 89 bugs
across 44 programs. Moreover, FPCC takes 6.4096 times as long as our proposed
method. We also deploy our method to multi-input programs, identifying a total
of nine bugs with an average detection time of 0.6443 seconds per program. In
contrast, FPCC fails to detect any bugs while requiring an average computation
time of 100 seconds per program.

*Liutong Han,Zhiyuan Tan,Hongbin Zhang,Pengcheng Wang,Chu Kang,Mingjie Xing,Yanjun Wu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces IntrinTrans, a LLM-based tool that automatically translates vectorized intrinsic code, optimizing RISC-V Vector (RVV) intrinsics for better performance compared to manual and rule-based efforts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of the RISC-V ecosystem requires efficient translation of vectorized intrinsic code from architectures like Arm Neon to RISC-V Vector (RVV) to reduce manual effort and improve performance.

Method: IntrinTrans employs a multi-agent approach using advanced LLMs, compile-and-test feedback, and liveness analysis to optimize RVV intrinsics derived from translated code.

Result: Experiments with 34 cases show the approach produces semantically correct translations in most cases, achieving performance gains of up to 5.93x over community-contributed implementations.

Conclusion: IntrinTrans facilitates automated, accurate, and performance-optimized translation of intrinsics from other architectures to RVV, addressing the inefficiencies of manual rewriting and rule-based methods.

Abstract: The use of intrinsic functions to exploit hardware-specific capabilities is
an important approach for optimizing library performance. Many mainstream
libraries implement a large number of vectorized algorithms on Arm or x86 SIMD
intrinsic functions. With the rapid expansion of the RISC-V hardware-software
ecosystem, there is a growing demand for support of the RISC-V Vector (RVV)
extension. Translating existing vectorized intrinsic code onto RVV intrinsics
is a practical and effective approach. However, current cross-architecture
translation largely relies on manual rewriting, which is time-consuming and
error-prone. Furthermore, while some rule-based methods can reduce the need for
manual intervention, their translation success rate is limited by incomplete
rule coverage and syntactic constraints, and the performance suffers from
inadequate utilization of RVV-specific features. We present IntrinTrans, a
LLM-based multi-agent approach that utilizes compile-and-test feedback to
translate intrinsic code across architectures automatically, and further
optimizes the generated RVV intrinsics using register-usage information derived
from liveness analysis. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we
collected 34 vectorized algorithm cases from open-source libraries. Each case
includes an Arm Neon intrinsics implementation and a RVV intrinsics
implementation contributed by the open-source community, together with
correctness and performance tests. Our experiments show that advanced LLMs
produce semantically correct RISC-V Vector intrinsics in most cases within a
limited number of iterations, and in some cases achieve up to 5.93x the
performance of the native implementation from the open-source community.

*Mengyao Zhao,Kaixuan Li,Lyuye Zhang,Wenjing Dang,Chenggong Ding,Sen Chen,Zheli Liu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper examines the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically generate Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploits for web application vulnerabilities using publicly disclosed information, achieving success rates of 8%-34% and up to 72% with optimized approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to explore whether publicly available information from disclosed CVEs can be effectively leveraged by LLMs to automatically generate valid PoC exploits, addressing the potential security concerns and opportunities brought by advanced code understanding.

Method: The researchers tested LLMs, specifically GPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1, on 100 real-world CVEs across three stages of vulnerability disclosure. They investigated the impact of supplementing code context and applied adaptive reasoning strategies to refine their approaches.

Result: The success rate for generating working PoCs ranged from 8%-34% using public data, with DeepSeek-R1 outperforming GPT-4o consistently. Adding code context increased success rates by up to 20%, and adaptive reasoning strategies further elevated them to 68%-72%.

Conclusion: LLMs show significant potential to reshape vulnerability exploitation dynamics, highlighting the risks and benefits of their application in cybersecurity. Their ability to generate valid PoC exploits using publicly disclosed information may require reconsideration of disclosure practices.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have brought remarkable
progress in code understanding and reasoning, creating new opportunities and
raising new concerns for software security. Among many downstream tasks,
generating Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploits plays a central role in
vulnerability reproduction, comprehension, and mitigation. While previous
research has focused primarily on zero-day exploitation, the growing
availability of rich public information accompanying disclosed CVEs leads to a
natural question: can LLMs effectively use this information to automatically
generate valid PoCs? In this paper, we present the first empirical study of
LLM-based PoC generation for web application vulnerabilities, focusing on the
practical feasibility of leveraging publicly disclosed information. We evaluate
GPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1 on 100 real-world and reproducible CVEs across three
stages of vulnerability disclosure: (1) newly disclosed vulnerabilities with
only descriptions, (2) 1-day vulnerabilities with patches, and (3) N-day
vulnerabilities with full contextual code. Our results show that LLMs can
automatically generate working PoCs in 8%-34% of cases using only public data,
with DeepSeek-R1 consistently outperforming GPT-4o. Further analysis shows that
supplementing code context improves success rates by 17%-20%, with
function-level providing 9%-13% improvement than file-level ones. Further
integrating adaptive reasoning strategies to prompt refinement significantly
improves success rates to 68%-72%. Our findings suggest that LLMs could reshape
vulnerability exploitation dynamics. To date, 23 newly generated PoCs have been
accepted by NVD and Exploit DB.

*Linghan Huang,Peizhou Zhao,Huaming Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: MOJOFuzzer introduces an adaptive LLM-based fuzzing framework for the MOJO programming language, improving test validity, API coverage, and bug detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As a new language, MOJO lacks robust testing frameworks, which limits the effectiveness of LLM-driven fuzz testing due to issues like model hallucination.

Method: MOJOFuzzer uses a multi-phase framework to filter low-quality inputs and dynamically adapts LLM prompts for iterative learning to improve fuzzing efficiency and bug detection.

Result: MOJOFuzzer significantly boosts test case validity, API coverage, and outperform existing methods in fuzz testing, identifying 13 previously unknown bugs in MOJO.

Conclusion: MOJOFuzzer advances LLM-driven software testing, establishing a foundational approach for testing emerging programming languages like MOJO.

Abstract: The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized
software testing, particularly fuzz testing, by automating the generation of
diverse and effective test inputs. This advancement holds great promise for
improving software reliability. Meanwhile, the introduction of MOJO, a
high-performance AI programming language blending Python's usability with the
efficiency of C and C++, presents new opportunities to enhance AI model
scalability and programmability. However, as a new language, MOJO lacks
comprehensive testing frameworks and a sufficient corpus for LLM-based testing,
which exacerbates model hallucination. In this case, LLMs will generate
syntactically valid but semantically incorrect code, significantly reducing the
effectiveness of fuzz testing. To address this challenge, we propose
MOJOFuzzer, the first adaptive LLM-based fuzzing framework designed for
zero-shot learning environments of emerging programming languages. MOJOFuzzer
integrates a mutil-phase framework that systematically eliminates low-quality
generated inputs before execution, significantly improving test case validity.
Furthermore, MOJOFuzzer dynamically adapts LLM prompts based on runtime
feedback for test case mutation, enabling an iterative learning process that
continuously enhances fuzzing efficiency and bug detection performance. Our
experimental results demonstrate that MOJOFuzzer significantly enhances test
validity, API coverage, and bug detection performance, outperforming
traditional fuzz testing and state-of-the-art LLM-based fuzzing approaches.
Using MOJOFuzzer, we have conducted a first large-scale fuzz testing evaluation
of MOJO, uncorvering 13 previous unknown bugs. This study not only advances the
field of LLM-driven software testing but also establishes a foundational
methodology for leveraging LLMs in the testing of emerging programming
languages.

*Sayan Mandal,Hua Jiang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Automated code review system combining static analysis, AST-guided context, and efficient LLM deployment reduces violation rates, review iterations, and enhances compliance efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiency of automated code review in compliance-heavy settings due to low-quality outputs and challenges with naive LLM integration.

Method: Utilizes static analysis findings, AST-guided context extraction, quantized open-weight models, and caching for serving concise reviews and remediation guidance.

Result: Achieved sub-minute median feedback times, competitive violation reduction rates, and lower violation rates compared to larger proprietary models.

Conclusion: The architecture reduces triage effort, maintains grounding, and enhances auditability and compliance workflows in safety-oriented environments.

Abstract: Automated code review adoption lags in compliance-heavy settings, where
static analyzers produce high-volume, low-rationale outputs, and naive LLM use
risks hallucination and incurring cost overhead. We present a production system
for grounded, PR-native review that pairs static-analysis findings with
AST-guided context extraction and a single-GPU, on-demand serving stack
(quantized open-weight model, multi-tier caching) to deliver concise
explanations and remediation guidance. Evaluated on safety-oriented C/C++
standards, the approach achieves sub-minute median first-feedback (offline p50
build+LLM 59.8s) while maintaining competitive violation reduction and lower
violation rates versus larger proprietary models. The architecture is
decoupled: teams can adopt the grounding/prompting layer or the serving layer
independently. A small internal survey (n=8) provides directional signals of
reduced triage effort and moderate perceived grounding, with participants
reporting fewer human review iterations. We outline operational lessons and
limitations, emphasizing reproducibility, auditability, and pathways to broader
standards and assisted patching.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper discusses retraining methods for machine learning forecasting models, comparing periodic to drift-based retraining in terms of efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of balancing accuracy and computational efficiency in the continuous retraining of ML-based capacity forecasting models.

Method: Investigating the effects of change-based (drift-based) retraining versus periodic retraining of time series forecasting models.

Result: Drift-based retraining provides comparable accuracy to periodic retraining in most scenarios, but periodic retraining is better for rapidly changing data.

Conclusion: Drift-based retraining is a cost-effective strategy for consistent data changes, but periodic retraining remains necessary for situations with rapid changes.

Abstract: Capacity management is critical for software organizations to allocate
resources effectively and meet operational demands. An important step in
capacity management is predicting future resource needs often relies on
data-driven analytics and machine learning (ML) forecasting models, which
require frequent retraining to stay relevant as data evolves. Continuously
retraining the forecasting models can be expensive and difficult to scale,
posing a challenge for engineering teams tasked with balancing accuracy and
efficiency. Retraining only when the data changes appears to be a more
computationally efficient alternative, but its impact on accuracy requires
further investigation. In this work, we investigate the effects of retraining
capacity forecasting models for time series based on detected changes in the
data compared to periodic retraining. Our results show that drift-based
retraining achieves comparable forecasting accuracy to periodic retraining in
most cases, making it a cost-effective strategy. However, in cases where data
is changing rapidly, periodic retraining is still preferred to maximize the
forecasting accuracy. These findings offer actionable insights for software
teams to enhance forecasting systems, reducing retraining overhead while
maintaining robust performance.

*Jugal Gajjar,Kaustik Ranaware,Kamalasankari Subramaniakuppusamy*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid framework combining heterogeneous graph-based program analysis with lightweight local LLMs for vulnerability detection, achieving superior accuracy and improved interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static and dynamic analyses often fail to account for structural dependencies, limiting their effectiveness in identifying vulnerabilities within software.

Method: The approach leverages heterogeneous graph representations of programs to capture control- and data-flow relations, integrating these with lightweight (<4B) local LLMs to enable vulnerability detection with enhanced topological and semantic reasoning.

Result: On Java vulnerability detection tasks, the method achieved 93.57% accuracy, outperforming Graph Attention Network embeddings by 8.36% and pretrained LLM baselines such as Qwen2.5 Coder 3B by 17.81%.

Conclusion: This framework provides a locally deployable and interpretable tool for vulnerability detection, combining structural and semantic insights to promote broader adoption in secure software development.

Abstract: Software vulnerabilities remain a persistent risk, yet static and dynamic
analyses often overlook structural dependencies that shape insecure behaviors.
Viewing programs as heterogeneous graphs, we capture control- and data-flow
relations as complex interaction networks. Our hybrid framework combines these
graph representations with light-weight (<4B) local LLMs, uniting topological
features with semantic reasoning while avoiding the cost and privacy concerns
of large cloud models. Evaluated on Java vulnerability detection (binary
classification), our method achieves 93.57% accuracy-an 8.36% gain over Graph
Attention Network-based embeddings and 17.81% over pretrained LLM baselines
such as Qwen2.5 Coder 3B. Beyond accuracy, the approach extracts salient
subgraphs and generates natural language explanations, improving
interpretability for developers. These results pave the way for scalable,
explainable, and locally deployable tools that can shift vulnerability analysis
from purely syntactic checks to deeper structural and semantic insights,
facilitating broader adoption in real-world secure software development.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper investigates the robustness of multi-agent systems (MASs) for code generation, revealing significant flaws and proposing repair methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While MASs excel in code generation tasks, their robustness, crucial for real-world applications, has been inadequately studied.

Method: The authors utilize a fuzzing-based testing approach with semantic-preserving mutation operators and a new fitness function to examine MASs across datasets and models, alongside comprehensive failure analysis.

Result: They discover that MASs fail to solve 7.9%-83.3% of previously solved tasks after mutations. A repairing method involving multi-prompt generation and a monitor agent improves system robustness, solving up to 88.9% of failures.

Conclusion: This study highlights critical flaws in MAS robustness and presents effective solutions, guiding the development of more reliable MASs for code generation.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MASs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for automated
code generation, demonstrating impressive performance on established benchmarks
by decomposing complex coding tasks across specialized agents with different
roles. Despite their prosperous development and adoption, their robustness
remains pressingly under-explored, raising critical concerns for real-world
deployment. This paper presents the first comprehensive study examining the
robustness of MASs for code generation through a fuzzing-based testing
approach. By designing a fuzzing pipeline incorporating semantic-preserving
mutation operators and a novel fitness function, we assess mainstream MASs
across multiple datasets and LLMs. Our findings reveal substantial robustness
flaws of various popular MASs: they fail to solve 7.9%-83.3% of problems they
initially resolved successfully after applying the semantic-preserving
mutations. Through comprehensive failure analysis, we identify a common yet
largely overlooked cause of the robustness issue: miscommunications between
planning and coding agents, where plans lack sufficient detail and coding
agents misinterpret intricate logic, aligning with the challenges inherent in a
multi-stage information transformation process. Accordingly, we also propose a
repairing method that encompasses multi-prompt generation and introduces a new
monitor agent to address this issue. Evaluation shows that our repairing method
effectively enhances the robustness of MASs by solving 40.0%-88.9% of
identified failures. Our work uncovers critical robustness flaws in MASs and
provides effective mitigation strategies, contributing essential insights for
developing more reliable MASs for code generation.

TL;DR: This study explores how novice software developers use generative AI for unit testing, identifying interaction strategies and prompting styles. Benefits include time-saving, but drawbacks like trust issues remain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the growing inclusion of generative AI in software engineering, particularly in tasks like unit test creation, and its potential to impact novice developers in terms of productivity and learning.

Method: The study conducted an observational analysis with 12 undergraduate students, examining their interaction strategies and prompting styles when using generative AI for unit testing.

Result: Four interaction strategies were identified along with prompting styles of test generation. Participants highlighted benefits (e.g., time-saving) and challenges (e.g., diminished trust, concerns about test quality). Interaction styles did not significantly affect test effectiveness.

Conclusion: While generative AI provides advantages like reduced cognitive load, adopting it brings challenges such as trust and ownership, especially for novice developers. Interaction strategies vary but do not notably alter code quality or mutation scores.

Abstract: The integration of generative AI tools like ChatGPT into software engineering
workflows opens up new opportunities to boost productivity in tasks such as
unit test engineering. However, these AI-assisted workflows can also
significantly alter the developer's role, raising concerns about control,
output quality, and learning, particularly for novice developers. This study
investigates how novice software developers with foundational knowledge in
software testing interact with generative AI for engineering unit tests. Our
goal is to examine the strategies they use, how heavily they rely on generative
AI, and the benefits and challenges they perceive when using generative
AI-assisted approaches for test engineering. We conducted an observational
study involving 12 undergraduate students who worked with generative AI for
unit testing tasks. We identified four interaction strategies, defined by
whether the test idea or the test implementation originated from generative AI
or the participant. Additionally, we singled out prompting styles that focused
on one-shot or iterative test generation, which often aligned with the broader
interaction strategy. Students reported benefits including time-saving, reduced
cognitive load, and support for test ideation, but also noted drawbacks such as
diminished trust, test quality concerns, and lack of ownership. While strategy
and prompting styles influenced workflow dynamics, they did not significantly
affect test effectiveness or test code quality as measured by mutation score or
test smells.

Conclusion: The ADE-QVAET model is an AI-ML-driven approach for scalable and accurate software defect prediction, significantly improving software engineering quality control.

Abstract: An AI-ML-powered quality engineering approach uses AI-ML to enhance software

routine tasks, predictive analytics, communication and collaboration, and in
agile practices leading to project success. Practitioners emphasize responsible
GenAI usage given concerns such as hallucinations, ethics and privacy, and lack

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel technique, \ourtool{}, which integrates a C-Rust Pointer Knowledge Graph with LLMs to perform project-level C-to-Rust translations producing safer and more idiomatic Rust code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: C code often poses memory safety challenges, so translating it to safe Rust improves software reliability. Existing methods struggle to produce fully idiomatic and safe translations at a project level.

Method: The paper introduces a C-Rust Pointer Knowledge Graph enriched with pointer usage and Rust-oriented annotations. This graph is synthesized with LLMs to guide project-level C-to-Rust translation.

Result: \ourtool{} showed a 99.9% reduction in unsafe Rust usages compared to rule-based methods and enhanced correctness by 29.3% over fuzzing-enhanced LLM approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed approach significantly improves the safety and correctness of C-to-Rust translations, offering an effective project-level solution to memory safety issues.

Abstract: Translating C code into safe Rust is an effective way to ensure its memory
safety. Compared to rule-based translation which produces Rust code that
remains largely unsafe, LLM-based methods can generate more idiomatic and safer
Rust code because LLMs have been trained on vast amount of human-written
idiomatic code. Although promising, existing LLM-based methods still struggle
with project-level C-to-Rust translation. They typically partition a C project
into smaller units (\eg{} functions) based on call graphs and translate them
bottom-up to resolve program dependencies. However, this bottom-up,
unit-by-unit paradigm often fails to translate pointers due to the lack of a
global perspective on their usage. To address this problem, we propose a novel
C-Rust Pointer Knowledge Graph (KG) that enriches a code-dependency graph with
two types of pointer semantics: (i) pointer-usage information which record
global behaviors such as points-to flows and map lower-level struct usage to
higher-level units; and (ii) Rust-oriented annotations which encode ownership,
mutability, nullability, and lifetime. Synthesizing the \kg{} with LLMs, we
further propose \ourtool{}, which implements a project-level C-to-Rust
translation technique. In \ourtool{}, the \kg{} provides LLMs with
comprehensive pointer semantics from a global perspective, thus guiding LLMs
towards generating safe and idiomatic Rust code from a given C project. Our
experiments show that \ourtool{} reduces unsafe usages in translated Rust by
99.9\% compared to both rule-based translation and traditional LLM-based
rewriting, while achieving an average 29.3\% higher functional correctness than
those fuzzing-enhanced LLM methods.

TL;DR: RepoSummary enhances repository summarization by generating documentation and improving traceability from features to code elements, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current repository summarization techniques cannot adequately trace high-level features to their implementing methods, making code comprehension and maintenance challenging.

Method: RepoSummary provides a feature-oriented approach to summarization and documentation generation while establishing traceability links between features and code elements.

Result: Compared to the state-of-the-art baseline (HGEN), RepoSummary showed improved feature coverage, traceability recall, and generated more readable and consistent documentation.

Conclusion: RepoSummary effectively addresses existing limitations in repository summarization, making it a notable improvement for aiding developers in code comprehension and maintenance tasks.

Abstract: Repository summarization is a crucial research question in development and
maintenance for software engineering. Existing repository summarization
techniques primarily focus on summarizing code according to the directory tree,
which is insufficient for tracing high-level features to the methods that
collaboratively implement them. To address these limitations, we propose
RepoSummary, a feature-oriented code repository summarization approach that
simultaneously generates repository documentation automatically. Furthermore,
it establishes more accurate traceability links from functional features to the
corresponding code elements, enabling developers to rapidly locate relevant
methods and files during code comprehension and maintenance. Comprehensive
experiments against the state-of-the-art baseline (HGEN) demonstrate that
RepoSummary achieves higher feature coverage and more accurate traceability. On
average, it increases the rate of completely covered features in manual
documentation from 61.2% to 71.1%, improves file-level traceability recall from
29.9% to 53.0%, and generates documentation that is more conceptually
consistent, easier to understand, and better formatted than that produced by
existing approaches.

Motivation: The motivation for the paper stems from the lack of research and benchmarks tailored to C/C++ program repair despite their widespread use and vulnerability prevalence.

Method: The authors developed Defects4C using real-world C/C++ repositories, which consisted of bug-relevant commits, buggy functions, and test cases to rigorously evaluate APR techniques and retrain learning-based approaches.

Result: Defects4C enabled the empirical evaluation of 24 state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) for C/C++ fault repairs, providing insights into their effectiveness and limitations.

Conclusion: Defects4C serves as a critical asset for driving research on C/C++ APR and calls for improved methods leveraging insights from the benchmark evaluation.

Abstract: Automated Program Repair (APR) plays a critical role in enhancing the quality
and reliability of software systems. While substantial progress has been made
in Java-based APR, largely facilitated by benchmarks like Defects4J, there
remains a significant gap in research on C/C++ program repair, despite the
widespread use of C/C++ and the prevalence of associated vulnerabilities. This
gap is primarily due to the lack of high-quality, open-source benchmarks
tailored for C/C++.
  To address this issue, we introduce Defects4C, a comprehensive and executable
benchmark specifically designed for C/C++ program repair. Our dataset is
constructed from real-world C/C++ repositories and includes a large collection
of bug-relevant commits (9M in total), 248 high-quality buggy functions, and
102 vulnerable functions, all paired with test cases for reproduction. These
resources enable rigorous evaluation of repair techniques and support the
retraining of learning-based approaches for enhanced performance.
  Using Defects4C, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study evaluating the
effectiveness of 24 state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) in repairing
C/C++ faults. Our findings offer valuable insights into the strengths and
limitations of current LLM-based APR techniques in this domain, highlighting
both the need for more robust methods and the critical role of Defects4C in
advancing future research

TL;DR: DebugTA is an LLM-based agent designed to assist in debugging and teaching programming by reducing reasoning challenges and leveraging standard code alignment. It improves accuracy and efficiency in generating error corrections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenges in programming education, where ineffective reasoning and limited use of standard code hinder the capability of tools in debugging and teaching erroneous code.

Method: The proposed DebugTA decomposes tasks into sequential LLM interactions, utilizes tools for code alignment, and engages external compilers for real-time code analysis adhering to debugging principles.

Result: Evaluation across three real-world datasets shows DebugTA enhances teaching effectiveness and lowers computational costs.

Conclusion: DebugTA simplifies logical reasoning, focuses on logic errors in code, and demonstrates improved accuracy in debugging tasks.

Abstract: In programming education, Debugging and Teaching (DT) task is a common
scenario where students receive assistance in correcting their erroneous code.
The task involves multiple inputs, including erroneous code, error messages,
reference solutions, and the question description, with the goal of generating
modification suggestions to the erroneous code. However, two key challenges
hinder the effectiveness of existing approaches. Firstly, the complexity and
heterogeneity of inputs inherent in DT tasks significantly elevate the
reasoning challenges faced by LLMs. Second, existing approaches often fail to
fully leverage the availability of standard code in DT tasks, forcing models to
rely solely on complex multi-step reasoning, which limits the potential of LLMs
in addressing DT tasks effectively. To address these challenges, we propose
DebugTA, a novel LLM-based debugging and teaching agent with specialized tools
for standard code retrieval, variable substitution to align reference code, and
an external compiler for real-time code analysis. Guided by explicit
pedagogical and debugging principles, DebugTA acts as an agent that decomposes
a complex task into sequential LLM interactions, each utilizing distinct tools
for specific subtasks, thereby simplifying the logical reasoning at each step
and reducing overall reasoning complexity. Furthermore, DebugTA utilizes tool
calls to align the standard code with the erroneous code as much as possible,
allowing the LLM to focus on logic errors within the erroneous code and
improving the accuracy of the generated suggestions. To rigorously assess the
quality of modification suggestions, we introduce a student simulator-teacher
interaction paradigm. Experimental results on three real-world code datasets
demonstrate that DebugTA consistently improves teaching effectiveness while
significantly reducing computational costs.

TL;DR: The paper examines FMware (applications built around foundation models like GPT) to identify its application areas, challenges faced, and resource-heavy issues through analysis of cloud-based and open-source platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With foundation models revolutionizing software engineering, there is a need to understand the challenges and practices in developing FMware systems, especially as they influence workflows and use cases.

Method: The study conducted a large-scale analysis of FMware ecosystems using data from GitHub repositories and platforms like HuggingFace, GPTStore, Ora, and Poe along three focal points: application domains, key challenges, and resource-intensive issues.

Result: The analysis identified major domains like education and content creation while surfacing challenges like memory management, dependency handling, and tokenizer configuration. It also found bug reports as frequent issues and code review as time-consuming.

Conclusion: The findings illuminate developer challenges and practices in FMware, offering actionable insights to improve tools, workflows, and community support while shaping future FMware development.

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs), such as OpenAI's GPT, are fundamentally transforming
the practice of software engineering by enabling the development of
\emph{FMware} -- applications and infrastructures built around these models.
FMware systems now support tasks such as code generation, natural-language
interaction, knowledge integration, and multi-modal content creation,
underscoring their disruptive impact on current software engineering workflows.
However, the design, implementation, and evolution of FMware present
significant new challenges, particularly across cloud-based and on-premise
platforms where goals, processes, and tools often diverge from those of
traditional software development.
  To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale analysis of FMware
development across both cloud-based platforms and open-source repositories. We
empirically investigate the FMware ecosystem through three focus areas: (1) the
most common application domains of FMware, (2) the key challenges developers
encounter, and (3) the types of issues that demand the greatest effort to
resolve. Our analysis draws on data from GitHub repositories and from leading
FMware platforms, including HuggingFace, GPTStore, Ora, and Poe. Our findings
reveal a strong focus on education, content creation, and business strategy,
alongside persistent technical challenges in memory management, dependency
handling, and tokenizer configuration. On GitHub, bug reports and core
functionality issues are the most frequently reported problems, while code
review, similarity search, and prompt template design are the most
time-consuming to resolve.
  By uncovering developer practices and pain points, this study points to
opportunities to improve FMware tools, workflows, and community support, and
provides actionable insights to help guide the future of FMware development.

*David Georg Reichelt,Shinhyung Yang,Wilhelm Hasselbring*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper integrates OpenTelemetry data into the Kieker framework for visualizing call trees and trace data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kieker is limited in supported programming languages, while OpenTelemetry standard provides broader instrumentation capabilities.

Method: Transform OpenTelemetry tracing data to integrate into the Kieker observability framework.

Result: Successful visualization of OpenTelemetry demo application data using Kieker analysis tools.

Conclusion: The approach enhances Kieker's usability by leveraging OpenTelemetry for broader language support and trace analysis.

Abstract: The observability framework Kieker provides a range of analysis capabilities,
but it is currently only able to instrument a smaller selection of languages
and technologies, including Java, C, Fortran, and Python. The OpenTelemetry
standard aims for providing reference implementations for most programming
languages, including C# and JavaScript, that are currently not supported by
Kieker. In this work, we describe how to transform OpenTelemetry tracing data
into the Kieker framework. Thereby, it becomes possible to create for example
call trees from OpenTelemetry instrumentations. We demonstrate the usability of
our approach by visualizing trace data of the Astronomy Shop, which is an
OpenTelemetry demo application.

TL;DR: The study analyzed how developers engage with Amazon's AI code-generation tool, CodeWhisperer, identifying four behavioral patterns through user studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how developers adopt and interact with AI code-generation tools like CodeWhisperer.

Method: Two user studies (10 participants each) were conducted—first to capture critical interactions and then to collect fine-grained data using a telemetry plugin, followed by a mixed-methods analysis.

Result: The study revealed four behavioral patterns in developers' use of CodeWhisperer: incremental code refinement, explicit instruction via natural language, baseline structuring with model suggestions, and integrative use with external sources.

Conclusion: The research provides valuable insights into developer interaction patterns with AI code-generators, informing tool design and development practices.

Abstract: The use of AI code-generation tools is becoming increasingly common, making
it important to understand how software developers are adopting these tools. In
this study, we investigate how developers engage with Amazon's CodeWhisperer,
an LLM-based code-generation tool. We conducted two user studies with two
groups of 10 participants each, interacting with CodeWhisperer - the first to
understand which interactions were critical to capture and the second to
collect low-level interaction data using a custom telemetry plugin. Our
mixed-methods analysis identified four behavioral patterns: 1) incremental code
refinement, 2) explicit instruction using natural language comments, 3)
baseline structuring with model suggestions, and 4) integrative use with
external sources. We provide a comprehensive analysis of these patterns .

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'CodeWatcher,' a system for unobtrusive data collection on developer interactions with code-generation tools within the VS Code environment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of collecting real-time, detailed programming behavior data without disrupting developer workflow.

Method: CodeWatcher uses a combination of a VS Code plugin, a Python-based RESTful API, and a MongoDB backend to capture and log interaction events like insertions, deletions, and focus shifts.

Result: The system offers timestamped, structured events that enable behavioral analyses and session reconstructions, providing insights into the use of code-generation tools.

Conclusion: CodeWatcher provides an essential infrastructure for research on responsible AI, developer productivity, and the evaluation of code-generation tools, with scalability and minimal workflow disruption.

Abstract: Understanding how developers interact with code generation tools (CGTs)
requires detailed, real-time data on programming behavior which is often
difficult to collect without disrupting workflow. We present
\textit{CodeWatcher}, a lightweight, unobtrusive client-server system designed
to capture fine-grained interaction events from within the Visual Studio Code
(VS Code) editor. \textit{CodeWatcher} logs semantically meaningful events such
as insertions made by CGTs, deletions, copy-paste actions, and focus shifts,
enabling continuous monitoring of developer activity without modifying user
workflows. The system comprises a VS Code plugin, a Python-based RESTful API,
and a MongoDB backend, all containerized for scalability and ease of
deployment. By structuring and timestamping each event, \textit{CodeWatcher}
enables post-hoc reconstruction of coding sessions and facilitates rich
behavioral analyses, including how and when CGTs are used during development.
This infrastructure is crucial for supporting research on responsible AI,
developer productivity, and the human-centered evaluation of CGTs. Please find

### [823] [Automatically Generating Questions About Scratch Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11658)
*Florian Obermüller,Gordon Fraser*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces automated question generation to assess program comprehension in Scratch programs using a set of 30 question types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current programming assessments based on mere task completion do not fully evaluate students' comprehension of programming concepts.

Method: The authors expanded the LitterBox tool to generate 54,118,694 comprehension questions based on a proposed 30-question model for Scratch programs.

Result: From over 600,000 Scratch projects, meaningful questions were generated and tested with 34 ninth graders, linking their ability to answer these questions to overall performance.

Conclusion: Automatically generated questions can meaningfully assess program comprehension in block-based programming (Scratch) and align with students' broader capabilities.

Abstract: When learning to program, students are usually assessed based on the code
they wrote. However, the mere completion of a programming task does not
guarantee actual comprehension of the underlying concepts. Asking learners
questions about the code they wrote has therefore been proposed as a means to
assess program comprehension. As creating targeted questions for individual
student programs can be tedious and challenging, prior work has proposed to
generate such questions automatically. In this paper we generalize this idea to
the block-based programming language Scratch. We propose a set of 30 different
questions for Scratch code covering an established program comprehension model,
and extend the LitterBox static analysis tool to automatically generate
corresponding questions for a given Scratch program. On a dataset of 600,913
projects we generated 54,118,694 questions automatically. Our initial
experiments with 34 ninth graders demonstrate that this approach can indeed
generate meaningful questions for Scratch programs, and we find that the
ability of students to answer these questions on their programs relates to
their overall performance.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper introduces an AI-based 'surrogate brain' framework for predicting brain dynamics using historical data, combining forward modeling, inverse problem solving, and evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To revolutionize our understanding and prediction of whole-brain dynamics by leveraging AI and data-driven approaches.

Method: A unified framework incorporating AI models for surrogate brain development, integrating forward modeling, inverse problem-solving strategies, and model evaluation processes.

Result: AI-based surrogate brains demonstrate the potential to decode neural systems, forecast complex dynamics, and simulate perturbations for better insight.

Conclusion: Surrogate brains can bridge the gap between theoretical neuroscience and neuroengineering, offering tools for advanced dynamical analysis and neurostimulation model guidance.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) are reshaping the way we
construct computational counterparts of the brain, giving rise to a new class
of ``surrogate brains''. In contrast to conventional hypothesis-driven
biophysical models, the AI-based surrogate brain encompasses a broad spectrum
of data-driven approaches to solve the inverse problem, with the primary
objective of accurately predicting future whole-brain dynamics with historical
data. Here, we introduce a unified framework of constructing an AI-based
surrogate brain that integrates forward modeling, inverse problem solving, and
model evaluation. Leveraging the expressive power of AI models and large-scale
brain data, surrogate brains open a new window for decoding neural systems and
forecasting complex dynamics with high dimensionality, nonlinearity, and
adaptability. We highlight that the learned surrogate brain serves as a
simulation platform for dynamical systems analysis, virtual perturbation, and
model-guided neurostimulation. We envision that the AI-based surrogate brain
will provide a functional bridge between theoretical neuroscience and
translational neuroengineering.

### [825] [A mathematical theory for understanding when abstract representations emerge in neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09816)
*Bin Wang,W. Jeffrey Johnston,Stefano Fusi*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper mathematically demonstrates how abstract representations of latent variables naturally emerge in the last hidden layers of trained feedforward neural networks and provides a toolkit to analyze these representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the mechanisms behind the emergence of disentangled, low-dimensional representations in neural activity spaces in brains and artificial neural networks, which support generalization.

Method: The authors develop a mathematical and analytical framework based on a mean-field approximation over neural preactivations in feedforward nonlinear networks. They study the emergence of abstract representations both mathematically and empirically in ReLU networks and extend the analysis to other architectures and activation functions.

Result: The paper shows that abstract representations are guaranteed to emerge at the global minima of the task objective in finite-width ReLU networks. It extends these findings to diverse architectures and activation functions.

Conclusion: Abstract representations naturally arise in neural networks optimized for tasks, reflecting the task structure or input semantics. This provides insight into similar phenomena in the brain and artificial neural networks.

Abstract: Recent experiments reveal that task-relevant variables are often encoded in
approximately orthogonal subspaces of the neural activity space. These
disentangled low-dimensional representations are observed in multiple brain
areas and across different species, and are typically the result of a process
of abstraction that supports simple forms of out-of-distribution
generalization. The mechanisms by which such geometries emerge remain poorly
understood, and the mechanisms that have been investigated are typically
unsupervised (e.g., based on variational auto-encoders). Here, we show
mathematically that abstract representations of latent variables are guaranteed
to appear in the last hidden layer of feedforward nonlinear networks when they
are trained on tasks that depend directly on these latent variables. These
abstract representations reflect the structure of the desired outputs or the
semantics of the input stimuli. To investigate the neural representations that
emerge in these networks, we develop an analytical framework that maps the
optimization over the network weights into a mean-field problem over the
distribution of neural preactivations. Applying this framework to a
finite-width ReLU network, we find that its hidden layer exhibits an abstract
representation at all global minima of the task objective. We further extend
these analyses to two broad families of activation functions and deep
feedforward architectures, demonstrating that abstract representations
naturally arise in all these scenarios. Together, these results provide an
explanation for the widely observed abstract representations in both the brain
and artificial neural networks, as well as a mathematically tractable toolkit
for understanding the emergence of different kinds of representations in
task-optimized, feature-learning network models.

### [826] [Egocentric Visual Navigation through Hippocampal Sequences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09951)
*Xiao-Xiong Lin,Yuk Hoi Yiu,Christian Leibold*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The study proposes that hippocampal sequences arise from intrinsic circuitry acting as a memory buffer under sparse inputs, and applies this idea in navigation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explain hippocampal sequences not just as spatial navigation cues but as products of intrinsic recurrent dynamics, offering a complementary perspective to planning-based theories.

Method: A minimal neurobiologically-inspired sequence generator was paired with an actor-critic learner to test navigational performance in a continuous maze with sparse inputs.

Result: The proposed model excelled in sparse input conditions, developing biological-like place fields and outperforming LSTMs in such scenarios.

Conclusion: Sparse inputs combined with sequence-generating dynamics offer both a biological basis for hippocampal sequences and a practical tool for reinforcement learning in navigation.

Abstract: Sequential activation of place-tuned neurons in an animal during navigation
is typically interpreted as reflecting the sequence of input from adjacent
positions along the trajectory. More recent theories about such place cells
suggest sequences arise from abstract cognitive objectives like planning. Here,
we propose a mechanistic and parsimonious interpretation to complement these
ideas: hippocampal sequences arise from intrinsic recurrent circuitry that
propagates activity without readily available input, acting as a temporal
memory buffer for extremely sparse inputs.We implement a minimal sequence
generator inspired by neurobiology and pair it with an actor-critic learner for
egocentric visual navigation. Our agent reliably solves a continuous maze
without explicit geometric cues, with performance depending on the length of
the recurrent sequence. Crucially, the model outperforms LSTM cores under
sparse input conditions (16 channels, ~2.5% activity), but not under dense
input, revealing a strong interaction between representational sparsity and
memory architecture.In contrast to LSTM agents, hidden sequence units develop
localized place fields, distance-dependent spatial kernels, and task-dependent
remapping, while inputs orthogonalize and spatial information increases across
layers. These phenomena align with neurobiological data and are causal to
performance. Together, our results show that sparse input synergizes with
sequence-generating dynamics, providing both a mechanistic account of place
cell sequences in the mammalian hippocampus and a simple inductive bias for
reinforcement learning based on sparse egocentric inputs in navigation tasks.

### [827] [Neural Hardware for the Language of Thought: New Rules for an Old Game](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10251)
*Gualtiero Piccinini*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper examines the Language of Thought (LOT) hypothesis and evaluates its compatibility with neural processing, ultimately supporting a Nonclassical version of LOT over the Classical one.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to understand whether cognitive processes rely on language-like representations and how these align with the functionality of neural hardware.

Method: The author distinguishes between different versions of the LOT hypothesis, details their hardware requirements, and evaluates them against empirical evidence.

Result: The Classical LOT (Fodor 1975) is found incompatible with empirical evidence, while a Nonclassical LOT, which aligns neural representations with natural language structures in a nondigital manner, is better supported.

Conclusion: The Nonclassical LOT hypothesis is a more plausible explanation of how cognitive processes align with neural computation, as it integrates syntactic and non-syntactic features.

Abstract: The Language of Thought (LOT) hypothesis posits that at least some important
cognitive processes involve language-like representations. These
representations must be processed by appropriate hardware. Since the organ of
biological cognition is the nervous system, whether biological cognition relies
on a LOT depends on how neural hardware works. I distinguish between different
versions of LOT, articulate their hardware requirements, and consider which
versions of LOT are supported by empirical evidence. I argue that the Classical
LOT hypothesis (Fodor 1975) is ruled out; the version of LOT that is best
supported by empirical evidence is the Nonclassical LOT thesis that some neural
representations mirror some of the structure of natural language and represent
in a language-like way, yet they encode information nondigitally and are
processed by ordinary (nondigital, and hence Nonclassical) neural computations
that rely not only on syntactic structure but many other features.

TL;DR: Study compares the geometry of cultured neuronal networks to the cosmic web and identifies shared structural principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore underlying geometric parallels between brain networks and the large-scale layout of the universe.

Method: AI-based geometric analysis applied to cultured neuronal networks, identifying patterns such as dendritic convergence, hub nodes, and void formations.

Result: Neuronal networks displayed non-random structural features and metrics resembling cosmic web patterns, revealing potential shared geometric principles.

Conclusion: The observed parallels suggest common geometric principles across biological and cosmic systems, urging cross-disciplinary research to deepen this understanding.

Abstract: Building on evidence of structural parallels between brain networks and the
cosmic web [1], we apply AI-based geometric analysis to cultured neuronal
networks. Isolated neurons self-organize into dendritic lattices shaped by
reproducible wiring rules. These lattices show non-random features-frequent
dendritic convergence, hub nodes, small-world connectivity, and large voids.
Synaptic contacts cluster and strengthen at hubs. Strikingly, these properties
mirror the cosmic web: dendritic branches resemble cosmic filaments and
synapses map to galaxies. Quantitative metrics align across systems, suggesting
shared underlying geometric principles. We invite cross-disciplinary
collaboration to interrogate and extend these parallels.

*G. Bargigli,L. Frassineti,A. Lanata',P. Baragli,C. Scopa,A. Vignoli*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This review assesses evidence for physiological co-modulation during human-animal interactions, analyzing 37 studies. It finds partial support for co-modulation but highlights limitations due to variability in study design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify and evaluate evidence of simultaneous physiological co-modulation in humans and animals during interactions.

Method: A systematic review of literature using multiple databases (e.g., PubMed, Scopus). Data was synthesized narratively and represented in tables and visual forms. Bias assessed with the ROBINS-I V2 tool.

Result: Out of 37 studies reviewed, 22 showed significant co-modulation, 9 partial, and 6 absent. Results varied based on methods and conditions, with time-series methods showing more consistent evidence than correlation analyses.

Conclusion: Preliminary evidence supports physiological co-modulation during human-animal interactions, but heterogeneous methods and study limitations prevent generalizations. Future work should systematically test this phenomenon.

Abstract: This review examines the evidence in the literature for physiological
co-modulation during human-animal interaction. The aim of this work is to
identify studies that assessed co-modulation via simultaneous measurement of
physiological signals in both species, performing quantitative comparisons, and
evaluate the consistency of the findings.\\ We searched PubMed, EM-BASE,
Scopus, Google Scholar, Animal Studies Repository, and the ''Consensus app''
tool between June and August 2025 (last search: August 5, 2025). Risk of bias
was assessed using an adapted version of the ROBINS-I V2 tool. Results were
grouped by data analysis method, interaction context, and physiological
parameter. Data were synthesised narratively, in structured tables and in
barplots. Thirty-seven studies were included, primarily focusing on dogs (n=22)
and horses (n=15), framed primarily within the interaction contexts of
Animal-Assisted Therapy and Intervention (AAT and AAI) and companionship.
Cardiac and hormonal measures were most frequently assessed. Most studies (n =
20) performed correlation analyses. Sample sizes ranged from less than 10 to
more than 130 dyads. Co-modulation resulted significant in 22 studies, partial
(limited to subsets of data) in 9, and absent in 6. Time-series coupling
methods yielded more consistent evidence than discrete-time correlations. Many
studies had small samples and did not explicitly test for significant
co-modulation. Evidence, while not conclusive, supports physiological
co-modulation during human-animal interactions. However, studies' heterogeneity
limits generalizability: rather than indicating a universal phenomenon,
findings suggest co-modulation may emerge under specific biological and
methodological conditions. Future research should explicitly test its presence
across contexts.

*Eva Guttmann-Flury,Jian Zhao,Mohamad Sawan*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the impact of different EEG re-referencing strategies on P300 classification accuracy, finding the large Laplacian to be the most effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address controversies regarding the necessity and optimal choice of EEG re-referencing strategies, which have been underexplored despite their significant impact on Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) performance.

Method: The study systematically evaluated four re-referencing strategies (no re-referencing, Common Average Reference, small Laplacian, and large Laplacian) on P300 classification accuracy using a controlled pipeline with 62-channel EEG data from 31 subjects across 2,520 trials.

Result: The large Laplacian reference outperformed other strategies, achieving the highest classification accuracy at 81.57% (hybrid method) and 75.97% (majority regions of interest). Ranking of performance is large Laplacian > CAR > no re-reference > small Laplacian.

Conclusion: The findings support the use of the large Laplacian re-referencing strategy to improve EEG-based P300 classification accuracy and provide a basis for unified methodological standards in future EEG studies.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a non-invasive window into brain
activity, enabling Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) for communication and
control. However, their performance is limited by signal fidelity issues, among
which the choice of re-referencing strategy is a pervasive but often overlooked
preprocessing bias. Addressing controversies about its necessity and optimal
choice, we adopted a quantified approach to evaluate four strategies - no
re-referencing, Common Average Reference (CAR), small Laplacian, and large
Laplacian - using 62-channels EEG (31 subjects, 2,520 trials). To our
knowledge, this is the first study systematically quantifying their impact on
single-trial P300 classification accuracy. Our controlled pipeline isolated
re-referencing effects for source-space reconstruction (eLORETA with Phase Lag
Index) and anatomically constrained classification. The large Laplacian
resolves distributed P3b networks while maintaining P3a specificity, achieving
the best P300 peak classification accuracy (81.57% hybrid method; 75.97%
majority regions of interest). Performance follows a consistent and
statistically significant hierarchy: large Laplacian > CAR > no re-reference >
small Laplacian, providing a foundation for unified methodological evaluation.

*Eva Guttmann-Flury,Yanyan Wei,Shan Zhao,Jian Zhao,Mohamad Sawan*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The study investigates the impact of electrode density in EEG-based BCIs on source localization and connectivity, highlighting that higher density ensures better source reconstruction. It introduces a novel sqrt(Re) scaling law to guide electrode optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing electrode density in BCIs is crucial for balancing usability and signal fidelity, especially in applications like source localization and disease monitoring.

Method: The study evaluates 62-, 32-, and 16-channel configurations using a standardized pipeline on P300 potential data from 31 subjects (63 sessions) with artifact correction and channel validation.

Result: Lower electrode densities degrade source reconstruction quality, obscure deep neural sources, and cause spatiotemporal distortions. The study identifies a sqrt(Re) scaling law for localization accuracy linked to electrode reduction.

Conclusion: High electrode densities are vital for precise source reconstruction, especially in clinical BCIs. The sqrt(Re) law offers a principled method for determining minimal electrode density while maintaining acceptable errors.

Abstract: Electrode density optimization in electroencephalography (EEG)-based
Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) requires balancing practical usability against
signal fidelity, particularly for source localization. Reducing electrodes
enhances portability but its effects on neural source reconstruction quality
and source connectivity - treated as proxies to BCI performance - remain
understudied. We address this gap through systematic evaluation of 62-, 32-,
and 16-channel configurations using a fixed, fully automated processing
pipeline applied to the well-characterized P300 potential. This approach's
rationale is to minimize variability and bias inherent to EEG analysis by
leveraging the P300's stimulus-locked reproducibility and pipeline
standardization. Analyzing 63 sessions (31 subjects) from the Eye-BCI dataset
with rigorous artifact correction and channel validation, we demonstrate: (1)
Progressive degradation in source reconstruction quality with sparser
configurations, including obscured deep neural generators and spatiotemporal
distortions; (2) A novel sqrt(Re) scaling law linking electrode reduction ratio
(Re) to localization accuracy - a previously unquantified relationship to the
best of our knowledge; (3) While reduced configurations preserve basic P300
topography and may suffice for communicative BCIs, higher-density channels are
essential for reliable deep source reconstruction. Overall, this study
establishes a first step towards quantitative benchmarks for electrode
selection, with critical implications for clinical BCIs requiring anatomical
precision in applications like neurodegenerative disease monitoring, where
compromised spatial resolution could mask pathological signatures. Most
importantly, the sqrt(Re) scaling law may provide the first principled method
to determine the minimal electrode density required based on acceptable error
margins or expected effect sizes.

### [832] [A compressed code for memory discrimination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10791)
*Dale Zhou,Sharon Mina Noh,Nora C Harhen,Nidhi V Banavar,C. Brock Kirwan,Michael A Yassa,Aaron M Bornstein*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether visual discrimination is better explained by lossy compression rather than expanding neural codes and finds evidence supporting the compression hypothesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether the ability to discriminate similar stimuli is supported by expanded neural representation (pattern separation) or by lossy compression of sensory information.

Method: The study trained neural networks to compress visual inputs, assessed lossiness, tested predictions on mnemonic similarity tasks, validated results with multiple datasets, and analyzed fMRI data for neural signatures of compression.

Result: Findings show that greater lossiness correlates with better discrimination of similar stimuli, particularly in higher-order visual brain regions, with results confirmed across image sets, behavioral datasets, and fMRI signals.

Conclusion: Lossy compression, by discarding redundant information, plays a key role in supporting mnemonic discrimination, especially in higher-order visual processing areas and the hippocampus.

Abstract: The ability to discriminate similar visual stimuli is an important index of
memory function. This ability is widely thought to be supported by expanding
the dimensionality of relevant neural codes, such that neural representations
for similar stimuli are maximally distinct, or ``separated.'' An alternative
hypothesis is that discrimination is supported by lossy compression of visual
inputs, efficiently coding sensory information by discarding seemingly
irrelevant details. A benefit of compression, relative to expansion, is that it
allows individuals to retain fewer essential dimensions underlying stimulus
variation -- a process linked to higher-order visual processing -- without
hindering discrimination. Under this hypothesis, pattern separation is
facilitated when more information from similar stimuli can be discarded, rather
than preserved. We test the compression versus expansion hypotheses by
predicting performance on the canonical mnemonic similarity task. We train
neural networks to compress perceptual and semantic factors of stimuli,
measuring lossiness using the mathematical framework underlying compression.
Consistent with the compression hypothesis, and not the expansion hypothesis,
greater lossiness predicts the ease and performance of lure discrimination,
especially in deeper convolutional network layers that predict higher-order
visual brain activity. We then confirm these predictions across two image sets,
four behavioral datasets, and alternative lossiness metrics. Finally, using
task fMRI, we identify signatures of lossy compression -- neural dimensionality
reduction and information loss -- in higher-order visual regions V4 and IT and
hippocampal DG/CA3 and CA1 linked to lure discrimination. These results suggest
lossy compression supports mnemonic discrimination by discarding redundant and
overlapping information.

TL;DR: This paper studies how humans make decisions in unfamiliar game settings and proposes the "Intuitive Gamer" model to explain adaptive decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore decision-making and judgment in novel problem scenarios, using novice gameplay as a lens.

Method: The paper proposes a computational cognitive model called "Intuitive Gamer," which simulates limited-depth probabilistic reasoning similar to a simplified Monte Carlo tree search.

Result: The model outperforms compute-heavy expert-level models in predicting human judgments and decisions for novel games, with varied experience levels.

Conclusion: The study enhances understanding of human adaptive reasoning in new situations and could inspire more human-like AI capable of evaluating and solving novel tasks.

Abstract: Games have long been a microcosm for studying planning and reasoning in both
natural and artificial intelligence, especially with a focus on expert-level or
even super-human play. But real life also pushes human intelligence along a
different frontier, requiring people to flexibly navigate decision-making
problems that they have never thought about before. Here, we use novice
gameplay to study how people make decisions and form judgments in new problem
settings. We show that people are systematic and adaptively rational in how
they play a game for the first time, or evaluate a game (e.g., how fair or how
fun it is likely to be) before they have played it even once. We explain these
capacities via a computational cognitive model that we call the "Intuitive
Gamer". The model is based on mechanisms of fast and flat (depth-limited)
goal-directed probabilistic simulation--analogous to those used in Monte Carlo
tree-search models of expert game-play, but scaled down to use very few
stochastic samples, simple goal heuristics for evaluating actions, and no deep
search. In a series of large-scale behavioral studies with over 1000
participants and 121 two-player strategic board games (almost all novel to our
participants), our model quantitatively captures human judgments and decisions
varying the amount and kind of experience people have with a game--from no
experience at all ("just thinking"), to a single round of play, to indirect
experience watching another person and predicting how they should play--and
does so significantly better than much more compute-intensive expert-level
models. More broadly, our work offers new insights into how people rapidly
evaluate, act, and make suggestions when encountering novel problems, and could
inform the design of more flexible and human-like AI systems that can determine
not just how to solve new tasks, but whether a task is worth thinking about at
all.

### [834] [Proprioceptive Misestimation of Hand Speed](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11664)
*Caitlin Callaghan,David J Reinkensmeyer*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: Participants performed a hand speed estimation task and exhibited systematic speed misestimation, overestimating slow speeds and underestimating fast speeds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to comprehend the human proprioceptive system's ability to estimate hand speed, which is inadequately understood.

Method: Participants engaged in a joint position reproduction experiment using hobby-grade mechatronics, where one hand controlled a servomotor-driven shaft, and the other reproduced its movements.

Result: Participants overestimated slow speeds (~45%) and underestimated fast speeds (~30%), with errors diminishing near 63 deg/s. A velocity misestimation-based model explained these errors.

Conclusion: The study highlights systematic perceptual inaccuracies in speed estimation by humans, suggesting reliance on velocity misestimates for position inference.

Abstract: The accuracy with which the human proprioceptive system estimates hand speed
is not well understood. To investigate this, we designed an experiment using
hobby-grade mechatronics parts and integrated it as a laboratory exercise in a
large remote laboratory course. In a simple joint position reproduction task,
participants (N = 191) grasped a servomotor-driven shaft with one hand as it
followed a randomized trajectory composed of sinusoidal submovements. They
simultaneously attempted to reproduce the movement by turning the shaft of a
potentiometer with the other hand. Focusing on the first movement of the
trajectory, we found that participants consistently overestimated the speed of
the slowest rotations by ~45% and underestimated the speed of the fastest
rotations also by ~30%. Speed estimation errors were near zero for trajectories
with peak velocities ~63 deg/s. Participants' movements also overshot slow
trajectories and undershot fast trajectories. We show that these trajectory
errors can be explained by a model in which the proprioceptive system
integrates velocity misestimates to infer position.

### [835] [Learning with Incomplete Context: Linear Contextual Bandits with Pretrained Imputation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09908)
*Hao Yan,Heyan Zhang,Yongyi Guo*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces the PULSE-UCB algorithm for online linear contextual bandits that integrates pretrained models to impute missing features, establishing regret bounds and performance guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of incorporating surrogate predictions from pretrained models into decision-making processes, especially in complex and nonstationary online decision settings.

Method: The proposed PULSE-UCB algorithm uses pretrained models, trained on auxiliary fully-observed data, to impute missing features in the bandit setting. Theoretical guarantees and regret decompositions are provided to evaluate its performance.

Result: PULSE-UCB demonstrates near-optimal performance under certain conditions, with results showing how uncertainty in pretrained models influences decision-making and how historical data impacts learning.

Conclusion: This approach effectively integrates surrogate predictions for online decision-making, demonstrating theoretical guarantees and practical applicability, with implications for data-hungry environments.

Abstract: The rise of large-scale pretrained models has made it feasible to generate
predictive or synthetic features at low cost, raising the question of how to
incorporate such surrogate predictions into downstream decision-making. We
study this problem in the setting of online linear contextual bandits, where
contexts may be complex, nonstationary, and only partially observed. In
addition to bandit data, we assume access to an auxiliary dataset containing
fully observed contexts--common in practice since such data are collected
without adaptive interventions. We propose PULSE-UCB, an algorithm that
leverages pretrained models trained on the auxiliary data to impute missing
features during online decision-making. We establish regret guarantees that
decompose into a standard bandit term plus an additional component reflecting
pretrained model quality. In the i.i.d. context case with H\"older-smooth
missing features, PULSE-UCB achieves near-optimal performance, supported by
matching lower bounds. Our results quantify how uncertainty in predicted
contexts affects decision quality and how much historical data is needed to
improve downstream learning.

### [836] [Calibrating Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10020)
*Henry D. Smith,Nathaniel L. Diamant,Brian L. Trippe*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces methods to mitigate miscalibration in generative models by framing calibration as a constrained optimization problem and utilizing surrogate objectives for fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models often struggle with miscalibration, leading to discrepancies between the desired and actual sampling distribution. Addressing these issues is essential for improving outputs across multiple applications.

Method: The authors propose treating calibration as a constrained optimization problem, and introduce two surrogate objectives for fine-tuning: relax loss (miscalibration penalty) and reward loss (reward-based fine-tuning).

Result: The paper demonstrates a significant reduction in calibration error across hundreds of constraints in models with up to one billion parameters, with applications in protein design, image generation, and language modeling.

Conclusion: These novel fine-tuning approaches effectively address calibration errors, advancing the reliability of generative models in various high-dimensional tasks.

Abstract: Generative models frequently suffer miscalibration, wherein class
probabilities and other statistics of the sampling distribution deviate from
desired values. We frame calibration as a constrained optimization problem and
seek the closest model in Kullback-Leibler divergence satisfying calibration
constraints. To address the intractability of imposing these constraints
exactly, we introduce two surrogate objectives for fine-tuning: (1) the relax
loss, which replaces the constraint with a miscalibration penalty, and (2) the
reward loss, which converts calibration into a reward fine-tuning problem. We
demonstrate that these approaches substantially reduce calibration error across
hundreds of simultaneous constraints and models with up to one billion
parameters, spanning applications in protein design, image generation, and
language modeling.

### [837] [Kernel Treatment Effects with Adaptively Collected Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10245)
*Houssam Zenati,Bariscan Bozkurt,Arthur Gretton*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for kernel-based distributional inference in adaptive experiments while addressing issues with i.i.d. assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable robust distributional inference in adaptive experiments, addressing challenges arising from broken i.i.d. assumptions.

Method: The method employs doubly robust scores combined with variance stabilization and uses a Hilbert-space martingale CLT to ensure asymptotic normality.

Result: The approach demonstrates well-calibrated performance with effectiveness in detecting both mean shifts and higher-moment differences, surpassing traditional scalar-effect methods.

Conclusion: This kernel-based framework effectively handles issues in adaptive experiments, providing accurate distributional inference beyond average effects.

Abstract: Adaptive experiments improve efficiency by adjusting treatment assignments
based on past outcomes, but this adaptivity breaks the i.i.d. assumptions that
underpins classical asymptotics. At the same time, many questions of interest
are distributional, extending beyond average effects. Kernel treatment effects
(KTE) provide a flexible framework by representing counterfactual outcome
distributions in an RKHS and comparing them via kernel distances. We present
the first kernel-based framework for distributional inference under adaptive
data collection. Our method combines doubly robust scores with variance
stabilization to ensure asymptotic normality via a Hilbert-space martingale
CLT, and introduces a sample-fitted stabilized test with valid type-I error.
Experiments show it is well calibrated and effective for both mean shifts and
higher-moment differences, outperforming adaptive baselines limited to scalar
effects.

### [838] [Neural variational inference for cutting feedback during uncertainty propagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10268)
*Jiafang Song,Sandipan Pramanik,Abhirup Datta*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces NeVI-Cut, a neural network-based method for variational inference that accurately handles cutting feedback in Bayesian analysis without requiring upstream data or models, achieving computational efficiency and improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for uncertainty propagation in Bayesian analysis (cutting feedback) are computationally intensive or dependent on upstream data and models, limiting efficiency and modularity.

Method: NeVI-Cut leverages neural networks and normalizing flows, using samples from upstream analyses to estimate conditional cut-posteriors without accessing upstream data or models.

Result: NeVI-Cut achieves significant speed improvements and higher accuracy compared to traditional methods, backed by theoretical guarantees and validated through simulations and real-world analyses.

Conclusion: NeVI-Cut offers an efficient, modular, and theoretically robust alternative for cutting feedback in Bayesian analyses, addressing current challenges in computational and approximation errors.

Abstract: In many scientific applications, uncertainty of estimates from an earlier
(upstream) analysis needs to be propagated in subsequent (downstream) Bayesian
analysis, without feedback. Cutting feedback methods, also termed cut-Bayes,
achieve this by constructing a cut-posterior distribution that prevents
backward information flow. Cutting feedback like nested MCMC is computationally
challenging while variational inference (VI) cut-Bayes methods need two
variational approximations and require access to the upstream data and model.
In this manuscript we propose, NeVI-Cut, a provably accurate and modular neural
network-based variational inference method for cutting feedback. We directly
utilize samples from the upstream analysis without requiring access to the
upstream data or model. This simultaneously preserves modularity of analysis
and reduces approximation errors by avoiding a variational approximation for
the upstream model. We then use normalizing flows to specify the conditional
variational family for the downstream parameters and estimate the conditional
cut-posterior as a variational solution of Monte Carlo average loss over all
the upstream samples. We provide theoretical guarantees on the NeVI-Cut
estimate to approximate any cut-posterior. Our results are in a fixed-data
regime and provide convergence rates of the actual variational solution,
quantifying how richness of the neural architecture and the complexity of the
target cut-posterior dictate the approximation quality. In the process, we
establish new results on uniform Kullback-Leibler approximation rates of
conditional normalizing flows. Simulation studies and two real-world analyses
illustrate how NeVI-Cut achieves significant computational gains over
traditional cutting feedback methods and is considerably more accurate than
parametric variational cut approaches.

### [839] [On some practical challenges of conformal prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10324)
*Liang Hong,Noura Raydan Nasreddine*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in conformal prediction and proposes a strategy to improve validity, reduce computation, and control shape.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conformal prediction has three challenges: approximate prediction regions affecting validity, heavy computational demands, and difficulty controlling region shape.

Method: Analyzed relationships between monotonicity properties and presented a strategy to address the challenges in conformal prediction.

Result: The proposed strategy offers a unified solution to improve the finite-sample validity, reduce computational effort, and gain better control over region shape.

Conclusion: The insights and strategy presented effectively overcome key practical limitations in conformal prediction, advancing its applicability.

Abstract: Conformal prediction is a model-free machine learning method for creating
prediction regions with a guaranteed coverage probability level. However, a
data scientist often faces three challenges in practice: (i) the determination
of a conformal prediction region is only approximate, jeopardizing the
finite-sample validity of prediction, (ii) the computation required could be
prohibitively expensive, and (iii) the shape of a conformal prediction region
is hard to control. This article offers new insights into the relationship
among the monotonicity of the non-conformity measure, the monotonicity of the
plausibility function, and the exact determination of a conformal prediction
region. Based on these new insights, we propose a simple strategy to alleviate
the three challenges simultaneously.

### [840] [High-Dimensional Learning Dynamics of Quantized Models with Straight-Through Estimator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10693)
*Yuma Ichikawa,Shuhei Kashiwamura,Ayaka Sakata*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the training dynamics of quantized neural networks using the Straight-Through Estimator (STE), emphasizing the lesser-studied role of quantization hyperparameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous research has primarily focused on surrogate gradients and convergence in quantized neural networks, but little attention has been paid to how hyperparameters like bit width and quantization range impact learning dynamics.

Method: Theoretical analysis in high-dimensional limits reveals deterministic dynamics modeled by an ordinary differential equation. Fixed-point analysis and adaptations of stochastic gradient descent techniques are applied.

Result: STE training shows a plateau phase followed by a sharp drop in generalization error, with plateau duration influenced by the quantization range. The deviation from unquantized models is quantified.

Conclusion: Quantization hyperparameters critically shape learning dynamics in quantized neural networks, improving understanding and optimization of STE training processes.

Abstract: Quantized neural network training optimizes a discrete, non-differentiable
objective. The straight-through estimator (STE) enables backpropagation through
surrogate gradients and is widely used. While previous studies have primarily
focused on the properties of surrogate gradients and their convergence, the
influence of quantization hyperparameters, such as bit width and quantization
range, on learning dynamics remains largely unexplored. We theoretically show
that in the high-dimensional limit, STE dynamics converge to a deterministic
ordinary differential equation. This reveals that STE training exhibits a
plateau followed by a sharp drop in generalization error, with plateau length
depending on the quantization range. A fixed-point analysis quantifies the
asymptotic deviation from the unquantized linear model. We also extend
analytical techniques for stochastic gradient descent to nonlinear
transformations of weights and inputs.

*Kyla Chasalow,Skyler Wu,Susan Murphy*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The study addresses the issue of missing data in online reinforcement learning by proposing online imputation ensembles, showing promise in a Grid World experiment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenges posed by missing data in online reinforcement learning, where imputation is needed at each step, impacting future data collection and learning.

Method: The paper introduces fully online imputation ensembles and tests different approaches to integrate these into learning and decision processes.

Result: In a Grid World experiment, the use of multiple imputation pathways demonstrated potential in balancing uncertainty handling and efficiency.

Conclusion: Maintaining multiple imputation pathways may serve as an effective strategy for constructing online missing data RL methods.

Abstract: Missing data in online reinforcement learning (RL) poses challenges compared
to missing data in standard tabular data or in offline policy learning. The
need to impute and act at each time step means that imputation cannot be put
off until enough data exist to produce stable imputation models. It also means
future data collection and learning depend on previous imputations. This paper
proposes fully online imputation ensembles. We find that maintaining multiple
imputation pathways may help balance the need to capture uncertainty under
missingness and the need for efficiency in online settings. We consider
multiple approaches for incorporating these pathways into learning and action
selection. Using a Grid World experiment with various types of missingness, we
provide preliminary evidence that multiple imputation pathways may be a useful
framework for constructing simple and efficient online missing data RL methods.

### [842] [How Patterns Dictate Learnability in Sequential Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10744)
*Mario Morawski,Anais Despres,Rémi Rehm*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a predictive information framework to define an information-theoretic learning curve and measure the inherent complexity in sequential data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models for sequential data are heavily reliant on underlying patterns, and misinterpreting these patterns can lead to model errors.

Method: The proposed framework uses predictive information (mutual information between past and future) to assess learnability and guide regression order estimation.

Result: The framework is validated on synthetic data, showcasing its ability to evaluate model adequacy, dataset complexity, and temporal structure.

Conclusion: Temporal patterns impose intrinsic limits on prediction, and the framework helps identify these limits while revealing interpretable data structures.

Abstract: Sequential data - ranging from financial time series to natural language -
has driven the growing adoption of autoregressive models. However, these
algorithms rely on the presence of underlying patterns in the data, and their
identification often depends heavily on human expertise. Misinterpreting these
patterns can lead to model misspecification, resulting in increased
generalization error and degraded performance. The recently proposed evolving
pattern (EvoRate) metric addresses this by using the mutual information between
the next data point and its past to guide regression order estimation and
feature selection. Building on this idea, we introduce a general framework
based on predictive information, defined as the mutual information between the
past and the future, $I(X_{past}; X_{future})$. This quantity naturally defines
an information-theoretic learning curve, which quantifies the amount of
predictive information available as the observation window grows. Using this
formalism, we show that the presence or absence of temporal patterns
fundamentally constrains the learnability of sequential models: even an optimal
predictor cannot outperform the intrinsic information limit imposed by the
data. We validate our framework through experiments on synthetic data,
demonstrating its ability to assess model adequacy, quantify the inherent
complexity of a dataset, and reveal interpretable structure in sequential data.

### [843] [Quantifying Dataset Similarity to Guide Transfer Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10866)
*Shudong Sun,Hao Helen Zhang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper presents a metric called Cross-Learning Score (CLS) to measure dataset similarity, enabling informed decisions on transfer learning effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of determining whether transferring knowledge between datasets will improve or harm model performance, especially under suboptimal conditions.

Method: The authors propose the Cross-Learning Score (CLS), a metric based on bidirectional generalization performance, which does not require expensive distribution estimation. The method also categorizes datasets into transferability zones and extends to encoder-head architectures in deep learning.

Result: CLS is computationally efficient and accurately predicts whether performance will improve or degrade under transfer learning settings. Extensive experiments validate its effectiveness across synthetic and real-world tasks.

Conclusion: The CLS metric provides a practical and theoretically grounded tool for assessing dataset similarity and guiding data selection to optimize transfer learning outcomes.

Abstract: Transfer learning has become a cornerstone of modern machine learning, as it
can empower models by leveraging knowledge from related domains to improve
learning effectiveness. However, transferring from poorly aligned data can harm
rather than help performance, making it crucial to determine whether the
transfer will be beneficial before implementation. This work aims to address
this challenge by proposing an innovative metric to measure dataset similarity
and provide quantitative guidance on transferability. In the literature,
existing methods largely focus on feature distributions while overlooking label
information and predictive relationships, potentially missing critical
transferability insights. In contrast, our proposed metric, the Cross-Learning
Score (CLS), measures dataset similarity through bidirectional generalization
performance between domains. We provide a theoretical justification for CLS by
establishing its connection to the cosine similarity between the decision
boundaries for the target and source datasets. Computationally, CLS is
efficient and fast to compute as it bypasses the problem of expensive
distribution estimation for high-dimensional problems. We further introduce a
general framework that categorizes source datasets into positive, ambiguous, or
negative transfer zones based on their CLS relative to the baseline error,
enabling informed decisions. Additionally, we extend this approach to
encoder-head architectures in deep learning to better reflect modern transfer
pipelines. Extensive experiments on diverse synthetic and real-world tasks
demonstrate that CLS can reliably predict whether transfer will improve or
degrade performance, offering a principled tool for guiding data selection in
transfer learning.

*Chenze Li,Subhadeep Paul*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes a centered random forest (CRF) for transfer learning in nonparametric regression, utilizing distance covariance-based feature weights to improve predictions, especially in scenarios with sparsely different regression functions between source and target domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to enhance the transfer learning capability of random forests, particularly when source and target regression functions differ sparsely across features, and to improve their predictive accuracy in specific datasets such as ICU patient mortality.

Method: The proposed method trains a CRF in the source domain, calculates residuals from predictions in the target domain, and then fits another CRF using weighted feature splitting probabilities based on distance covariance. This approach theoretically and numerically demonstrates transfer learning benefits and distance-covariance-based weighting advantages.

Result: Theoretical analysis provides an upper bound on the mean square error to show transfer learning benefits. Simulations validate the numerical applicability of the approach to standard random forests while achieving significant gains in predicting ICU patient mortality in smaller hospitals.

Conclusion: The CRF with distance-covariance-based feature weights improves the accuracy and applicability of random forests in transfer learning and specific real-world settings like ICU patient mortality prediction.

Abstract: Random forest is an important method for ML applications due to its broad
outperformance over competing methods for structured tabular data. We propose a
method for transfer learning in nonparametric regression using a centered
random forest (CRF) with distance covariance-based feature weights, assuming
the unknown source and target regression functions are different for a few
features (sparsely different). Our method first obtains residuals from
predicting the response in the target domain using a source domain-trained CRF.
Then, we fit another CRF to the residuals, but with feature splitting
probabilities proportional to the sample distance covariance between the
features and the residuals in an independent sample. We derive an upper bound
on the mean square error rate of the procedure as a function of sample sizes
and difference dimension, theoretically demonstrating transfer learning
benefits in random forests. In simulations, we show that the results obtained
for the CRFs also hold numerically for the standard random forest (SRF) method
with data-driven feature split selection. Beyond transfer learning, our results
also show the benefit of distance-covariance-based weights on the performance
of RF in some situations. Our method shows significant gains in predicting the
mortality of ICU patients in smaller-bed target hospitals using a large
multi-hospital dataset of electronic health records for 200,000 ICU patients.

*Tomoya Wakayama,Taiji Suzuki*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper provides a finite-sample statistical analysis of in-context learning (ICL), introducing a risk decomposition into Bayes Gap and Posterior Variance, and demonstrating key insights about Transformer behavior during pretraining and testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand and characterize the performance and theory behind in-context learning, particularly how Transformers behave within a meta-learning framework involving diverse task types.

Method: The authors proposed a risk decomposition framework to evaluate ICL performance, deriving a non-asymptotic upper bound on the Bayes Gap for uniform-attention Transformers and analyzing the Posterior Variance as a model-independent source of task-related uncertainty.

Result: The analysis indicates that the Bayes Gap quantifies how closely the model approximates the Bayes-optimal predictor and that task-specific uncertainty from Posterior Variance decreases exponentially with additional in-context examples.

Conclusion: Transformers pretrain to select an optimal meta-algorithm and subsequently adapt swiftly to the optimal algorithm for the specific task at hand, showcasing the efficiency and adaptability of ICL in diverse task settings.

Abstract: This paper develops a finite-sample statistical theory for in-context
learning (ICL), analyzed within a meta-learning framework that accommodates
mixtures of diverse task types. We introduce a principled risk decomposition
that separates the total ICL risk into two orthogonal components: Bayes Gap and
Posterior Variance. The Bayes Gap quantifies how well the trained model
approximates the Bayes-optimal in-context predictor. For a uniform-attention
Transformer, we derive a non-asymptotic upper bound on this gap, which
explicitly clarifies the dependence on the number of pretraining prompts and
their context length. The Posterior Variance is a model-independent risk
representing the intrinsic task uncertainty. Our key finding is that this term
is determined solely by the difficulty of the true underlying task, while the
uncertainty arising from the task mixture vanishes exponentially fast with only
a few in-context examples. Together, these results provide a unified view of
ICL: the Transformer selects the optimal meta-algorithm during pretraining and
rapidly converges to the optimal algorithm for the true task at test time.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework to improve the adversarial robustness of Learning-to-Defer (L2D) systems, focusing on one-stage settings where the predictor and allocation are trained jointly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the vulnerability of L2D systems to adversarial perturbations, which can manipulate both predictions and deferrals. Existing studies focus on two-stage settings, leaving one-stage scenarios unexamined.

Method: The authors formalize adversarial attacks targeting one-stage L2D systems, propose cost-sensitive adversarial surrogate losses, and establish theoretical guarantees for robustness.

Result: The proposed methods demonstrated improved adversarial robustness in experiments on benchmark datasets, while maintaining performance on clean, unperturbed data.

Conclusion: The study conclusively shows that incorporating the proposed framework enhances the robustness of one-stage L2D systems against adversarial attacks without sacrificing baseline performance.

Abstract: Learning-to-Defer (L2D) enables hybrid decision-making by routing inputs
either to a predictor or to external experts. While promising, L2D is highly
vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, which can not only flip predictions
but also manipulate deferral decisions. Prior robustness analyses focus solely
on two-stage settings, leaving open the end-to-end (one-stage) case where
predictor and allocation are trained jointly. We introduce the first framework
for adversarial robustness in one-stage L2D, covering both classification and
regression. Our approach formalizes attacks, proposes cost-sensitive
adversarial surrogate losses, and establishes theoretical guarantees including
$\mathcal{H}$, $(\mathcal{R }, \mathcal{F})$, and Bayes consistency.
Experiments on benchmark datasets confirm that our methods improve robustness
against untargeted and targeted attacks while preserving clean performance.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces constrained f-entropic risk measures to address data imbalances and provides PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds, along with a subgroup-focused algorithm for practical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PAC generalization bounds fail to sufficiently capture subgroup imbalances in datasets.

Method: Proposes constrained f-entropic risk measures and derives PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds for them, alongside a subgroup-focused algorithm.

Result: Developed self-bounding algorithms with subgroup-level guarantees and demonstrated their empirical effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed risk measures and bounds improve control over distributional shifts and data imbalances, especially at the subgroup level.

Abstract: PAC generalization bounds on the risk, when expressed in terms of the
expected loss, are often insufficient to capture imbalances between subgroups
in the data. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a new family of risk
measures, called constrained f-entropic risk measures, which enable finer
control over distributional shifts and subgroup imbalances via f-divergences,
and include the Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR), a well-known risk measure. We
derive both classical and disintegrated PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds for
this family of risks, providing the first disintegratedPAC-Bayesian guarantees
beyond standard risks. Building on this theory, we design a self-bounding
algorithm that minimizes our bounds directly, yielding models with guarantees
at the subgroup level. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the usefulness of
our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional regression often faces challenges from heavy-tailed noise and outliers, which compromise the reliability of least-squares methods.

Method: The study integrates a non-smooth Wilcoxon regression objective with structured group sparsity regularization and develops a data-driven tuning parameter selection framework. It proposes a proximal augmented Lagrangian optimization method for solving computational issues.

Result: The paper presents finite-sample error bounds for the estimator, demonstrates its robustness and effectiveness through simulations, and showcases scalability in various settings.

Conclusion: The developed method improves robustness in high-dimensional regression, addresses computational issues, and demonstrates reliability across simulated and real-data experiments.

Abstract: High-dimensional regression often suffers from heavy-tailed noise and
outliers, which can severely undermine the reliability of least-squares based
methods. To improve robustness, we adopt a non-smooth Wilcoxon score based rank
objective and incorporate structured group sparsity regularization, a natural
generalization of the lasso, yielding a group lasso regularized rank regression
method. By extending the tuning-free parameter selection scheme originally
developed for the lasso, we introduce a data-driven, simulation-based tuning
rule and further establish a finite-sample error bound for the resulting
estimator. On the computational side, we develop a proximal augmented
Lagrangian method for solving the associated optimization problem, which
eliminates the singularity issues encountered in existing methods, thereby
enabling efficient semismooth Newton updates for the subproblems. Extensive
numerical experiments demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our
proposed estimator against alternatives, and showcase the scalability of the
algorithm across both simulated and real-data settings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the problem of generating synthetic text with differential privacy while avoiding overprotection of non-sensitive content, which leads to utility loss and computational inefficiency.

Method: The authors propose the Secret-Protected Evolution (SecPE) framework that offers secret-aware protection with $(\mathrm{p}, \mathrm{r})$-secret guarantees, leveraging a relaxation of Gaussian DP for better trade-offs between utility and privacy.

Result: SecPE achieves lower Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) and higher downstream task accuracy across OpenReview, PubMed, and Yelp benchmarks compared to GDP-based Aug-PE baselines, while using less noise.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that secret-aware guarantees can enhance the practicality and effectiveness of privacy-preserving synthetic text generation, reducing computational overhead and improving utility-privacy balance.

Abstract: Text data has become extremely valuable on large language models (LLMs) and
even lead to general artificial intelligence (AGI). A lot of high-quality text
in the real world is private and cannot be freely used due to privacy concerns.
Therefore, differentially private (DP) synthetic text generation has been
proposed, aiming to produce high-utility synthetic data while protecting
sensitive information. However, existing DP synthetic text generation imposes
uniform guarantees that often overprotect non-sensitive content, resulting in
substantial utility loss and computational overhead. Therefore, we propose
Secret-Protected Evolution (SecPE), a novel framework that extends private
evolution with secret-aware protection. Theoretically, we show that SecPE
satisfies $(\mathrm{p}, \mathrm{r})$-secret protection, constituting a
relaxation of Gaussian DP that enables tighter utility-privacy trade-offs,
while also substantially reducing computational complexity relative to baseline
methods. Empirically, across the OpenReview, PubMed, and Yelp benchmarks, SecPE
consistently achieves lower Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and higher
downstream task accuracy than GDP-based Aug-PE baselines, while requiring less
noise to attain the same level of protection. Our results highlight that
secret-aware guarantees can unlock more practical and effective
privacy-preserving synthetic text generation.

### [851] [Hound: Relation-First Knowledge Graphs for Complex-System Reasoning in Security Audits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09633)
*Bernhard Mueller*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Hound is a graph-based engine that enhances reasoning in complex codebases by employing flexible views and updating vulnerability hypotheses, showing clear performance improvements over baseline models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving system-level reasoning and vulnerability detection across complicated, interrelated components in software codebases.

Method: Hound uses relation-first graph design for analyst-defined flexible views and implements a persistent belief system with hypothesis-driven evidence accumulation and QA finalization.

Result: Hound demonstrated significant improvement in recall (31.2% vs. 8.3%) and F1 scores (14.2% vs. 9.8%) compared to a baseline LLM, with a trade-off in precision.

Conclusion: The relation-first approach and persistent belief system significantly boost system reasoning and code understanding, pushing performance metrics beyond traditional methods.

Abstract: Hound introduces a relation-first graph engine that improves system-level
reasoning across interrelated components in complex codebases. The agent
designs flexible, analyst-defined views with compact annotations (e.g.,
monetary/value flows, authentication/authorization roles, call graphs, protocol
invariants) and uses them to anchor exact retrieval: for any question, it loads
precisely the code that matters (often across components) so it can zoom out to
system structure and zoom in to the decisive lines. A second contribution is a
persistent belief system: long-lived vulnerability hypotheses whose confidence
is updated as evidence accrues. The agent employs coverage-versus-intuition
planning and a QA finalizer to confirm or reject hypotheses. On a five-project
subset of ScaBench[1], Hound improves recall and F1 over a baseline LLM
analyzer (micro recall 31.2% vs. 8.3%; F1 14.2% vs. 9.8%) with a modest
precision trade-off. We attribute these gains to flexible, relation-first
graphs that extend model understanding beyond call/dataflow to abstract
aspects, plus the hypothesis-centric loop; code and artifacts are released to
support reproduction.

### [852] [A Semantic Model for Audit of Cloud Engines based on ISO/IEC TR 3445:2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09690)
*Morteza Sargolzaei Javan*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified semantic model for cloud systems, integrating architectural and compliance standards to enhance interoperability, security, auditability, and vendor-neutral design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cloud computing lacks a unified framework for architectural interoperability and compliance, which limits auditability and robust security.

Method: The paper develops a semantic model using RDF/Turtle, merging architectural taxonomy (ISO/IEC 22123) and compliance standards (ISO/IEC 27001:2022, ISO/IEC TR 3445:2022). It defines four interfaces: Control, Business, Audit, and Data, along with a security ontology mapping mechanisms like authentication to compliance controls.

Result: The model supports automated compliance validation and semantic reasoning, demonstrated through practical case studies with OpenStack and AWS, along with reproducible validation workflows via SPARQL and SHACL.

Conclusion: This framework enhances cloud security modeling by unifying architectural and compliance standards, emphasizing auditability and vendor-neutral designs.

Abstract: Cloud computing has become the foundation of modern digital infrastructure,
yet the absence of a unified architectural and compliance framework impedes
interoperability, auditability, and robust security. This paper introduces a
formal, machine-readable semantic model for Cloud Engines, integrating the
architectural taxonomy of ISO/IEC 22123 (Cloud Reference Architecture) with the
security and compliance controls of ISO/IEC 27001:2022 and ISO/IEC TR
3445:2022. The model decomposes cloud systems into four canonical
interfaces--Control, Business, Audit, and Data--and extends them with a
security ontology that maps mechanisms such as authentication, authorization,
and encryption to specific compliance controls. Expressed in RDF/Turtle, the
model enables semantic reasoning, automated compliance validation, and
vendor-neutral architecture design. We demonstrate its practical utility
through OpenStack and AWS case studies, and provide reproducible validation
workflows using SPARQL and SHACL. This work advances the state of cloud
security modeling by bridging architectural and compliance standards in a
unified framework, with a particular emphasis on auditability.

*Rupam Patir,Keyan Guo,Haipeng Cai,Hongxin Hu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Introduces GRASP, a novel approach for guiding Large Language Models (LLMs) in secure code generation using a DAG-based SCP graph for structured reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address security vulnerabilities in LLM-generated code without relying on resource-intensive training or external feedback methods.

Method: Utilizes a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to structure Secure Coding Practices (SCPs), combined with graph-based reasoning to guide LLMs.

Result: GRASP achieves over 80% Security Rates across various LLMs, with up to 88% improvement in addressing zero-day vulnerabilities compared to baselines.

Conclusion: GRASP offers an interpretable, scalable, and model-agnostic solution for enhancing security in LLM-generated code, especially for unknown vulnerabilities.

Abstract: The code generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have
transformed the field of software development. However, this advancement also
presents significant security challenges, as LLM-generated code often contains
vulnerabilities. One direction of research strengthens LLMs by injecting or
refining security knowledge through curated datasets, model tuning, or static
analyzers. While effective in certain settings, these methods can be
resource-intensive, less adaptable to zero-day vulnerabilities, and often
inapplicable to proprietary models. To address these challenges, we introduce
GRASP, which explores a new direction that focuses on structured reasoning over
Secure Coding Practices(SCPs) rather than additional training or external
feedback. GRASP comprises two key ideas: (1) an SCP graph that organizes SCPs
into a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) capturing dependencies and relationships,
and (2) a graph-based reasoning process that systematically guides LLMs through
relevant SCPs for code generation. This design enables interpretable,
model-agnostic, and scalable security improvements, particularly for previously
unseen vulnerabilities. Our evaluation shows that GRASP consistently achieves
Security Rates (SR) exceeding 80% across multiple LLMs, and delivers up to 88%
improvements over baselines on zero-day vulnerabilities.

### [854] [PrediQL: Automated Testing of GraphQL APIs with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10407)
*Shaolun Liu,Sina Marefat,Omar Tsai,Yu Chen,Zecheng Deng,Jia Wang,Mohammad A. Tayebi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: PrediQL is a novel LLM-guided fuzzer designed to uncover GraphQL API vulnerabilities via retrieval-augmented query generation and adaptive feedback mechanisms, outperforming existing methods in coverage and vulnerability detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GraphQL's flexible and nested query structure makes its APIs prone to complex, context-dependent vulnerabilities, which are challenging to discover using traditional testing tools.

Method: PrediQL employs a retrieval-augmented approach and large language model reasoning to intelligently generate semantically valid queries. It integrates adaptive feedback loops modeled as a multi-armed bandit problem and a context-aware vulnerability detector.

Result: PrediQL achieves significantly improved coverage and higher vulnerability discovery rates than state-of-the-art GraphQL API testing tools in evaluations on open-source and benchmark APIs.

Conclusion: The combination of retrieval-augmented reasoning and adaptive fuzzing establishes PrediQL as an effective approach to shifting API security testing from reactive payload enumeration to intelligent vulnerability exploration.

Abstract: GraphQL's flexible query model and nested data dependencies expose APIs to
complex, context-dependent vulnerabilities that are difficult to uncover using
conventional testing tools. Existing fuzzers either rely on random payload
generation or rigid mutation heuristics, failing to adapt to the dynamic
structures of GraphQL schemas and responses. We present PrediQL, the first
retrieval-augmented, LLM-guided fuzzer for GraphQL APIs. PrediQL combines large
language model reasoning with adaptive feedback loops to generate semantically
valid and diverse queries. It models the choice of fuzzing strategy as a
multi-armed bandit problem, balancing exploration of new query structures with
exploitation of past successes. To enhance efficiency, PrediQL retrieves and
reuses execution traces, schema fragments, and prior errors, enabling
self-correction and progressive learning across test iterations. Beyond input
generation, PrediQL integrates a context-aware vulnerability detector that uses
LLM reasoning to analyze responses, interpreting data values, error messages,
and status codes to identify issues such as injection flaws, access-control
bypasses, and information disclosure. Our evaluation across open-source and
benchmark GraphQL APIs shows that PrediQL achieves significantly higher
coverage and vulnerability discovery rates compared to state-of-the-art
baselines. These results demonstrate that combining retrieval-augmented
reasoning with adaptive fuzzing can transform API security testing from
reactive enumeration to intelligent exploration.

### [855] [Causal Digital Twins for Cyber-Physical Security: A Framework for Robust Anomaly Detection in Industrial Control Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09616)
*Mohammadhossein Homaei,Mehran Tarif,Mar Avilla,Andres Caro*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Causal Digital Twin (CDT) framework for enhancing cyber-physical security in industrial control systems by using causal inference and digital twin modeling, significantly improving anomaly detection and mitigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial Control Systems face growing threats from cyber-physical attacks leveraging both network and physical process vulnerabilities. Existing anomaly detection techniques struggle with distinguishing true causal relationships, leading to high false alarm rates and ineffective root cause analysis.

Method: The authors introduce a Causal Digital Twin framework that integrates causal inference theory with digital twin modeling. It supports three causal reasoning tasks: association, intervention, and counterfactual analysis. The framework is evaluated on the SWaT, WADI, and HAI datasets with measures like physical constraint compliance, synthetic ground truth testing, and statistical comparisons against baselines.

Result: The paper's method shows improvements in anomaly detection, achieving high F1-scores (0.944 for SWaT, 0.902 for WADI, 0.923 for HAI) and outperforming seven baseline methods. It reduces false positives by 74%, improves root cause accuracy to 78.4%, and decreases attack success rates by 73.2%. It maintains real-time performance with 3.2 ms latency.

Conclusion: The CDT framework effectively enhances the security of industrial control systems, offering interpretable and real-time solutions with significant improvements in accuracy, false positive reduction, and actionable insights for operators. It is a promising approach for industrial applications.

Abstract: Industrial Control Systems (ICS) face growing cyber-physical attacks that
exploit both network vulnerabilities and physical processes. Current anomaly
detection methods rely on correlation-based analysis, which cannot separate
true causal relationships from spurious associations. This limitation results
in high false alarm rates and poor root cause analysis. We propose a novel
Causal Digital Twin (CDT) framework for cyber-physical security in medium-scale
ICS. Our method combines causal inference theory with digital twin modeling.
The framework enables three types of causal reasoning: association for pattern
detection, intervention for understanding system responses, and counterfactual
analysis for attack prevention planning. We evaluate our framework on three
industrial datasets: SWaT, WADI, and HAI, with validation through physical
constraint compliance (90.8\%) and synthetic ground truth testing (structural
Hamming distance 0.13). Results show significant improvements over seven
baseline methods. Our CDT achieves F1-scores are $0.944 \pm 0.014$ for SWaT,
$0.902 \pm 0.021$ for WADI, and $0.923 \pm 0.018$ for HAI with statistical
significance ($p < 0.0024$, Bonferroni corrected). The framework reduces false
positives by \SI{74}{\percent} and achieves \SI{78.4}{\percent} root cause
analysis accuracy compared to \SI{48.7}{\percent} for existing methods.
Counterfactual analysis enables defense strategies that reduce attack success
by \SI{73.2}{\percent}. The system keeps real-time performance with
\SI{3.2}{ms} latency, which is suitable for industrial deployment, while
providing interpretable explanations for operators.

*Jiayun Mo,Xin Kang,Tieyan Li,Zhongding Lei*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper discusses a TRL (Trust, Risk, and Liability) framework to systematically address challenges of trust, risk, and liability in AI applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address overlapping concerns about trust, risks, and liability in AI usage, which are currently managed in isolation without considering their interconnected nature.

Method: The TRL framework integrates interactions between trust, risk, and liability to provide systematic analysis and solutions tailored to AI application scenarios.

Result: The framework offers insights into promoting trust, reducing risks, and ensuring responsible usage of AI in contexts such as 6G networks.

Conclusion: The TRL framework has potential to guide the trustworthy, risk-free, and ethical implementation of AI systems, addressing societal, economic, and ethical concerns.

Abstract: The excitement brought by the development of AI agents came alongside arising
problems. These concerns centered around users' trust issues towards AIs, the
risks involved, and the difficulty of attributing responsibilities and
liabilities. Current solutions only attempt to target each problem separately
without acknowledging their inter-influential nature. The Trust, Risk and
Liability (TRL) framework proposed in this paper, however, ties together the
interdependent relationships of trust, risk, and liability to provide a
systematic method of building and enhancing trust, analyzing and mitigating
risks, and allocating and attributing liabilities. It can be applied to analyze
any application scenarios of AI agents and suggest appropriate measures fitting
to the context. The implications of the TRL framework lie in its potential
societal impacts, economic impacts, ethical impacts, and more. It is expected
to bring remarkable values to addressing potential challenges and promoting
trustworthy, risk-free, and responsible usage of AI in 6G networks.

### [857] [Rounding-Guided Backdoor Injection in Deep Learning Model Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09647)
*Xiangxiang Chen,Peixin Zhang,Jun Sun,Wenhai Wang,Jingyi Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces QuRA, a backdoor attack exploiting model quantization to embed malicious behaviors, achieving nearly 100% attack success with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address security risks in deep learning models deployed in resource-constrained environments using model quantization.

Method: Proposes a weight selection strategy and optimizes weight rounding directions to amplify backdoor effects without harming the model's performance.

Result: QuRA achieves nearly 100% success in attacks with minimal performance impact and can evade existing defenses.

Conclusion: Highlights a critical vulnerability in model quantization, emphasizing the urgent need for improved security measures.

Abstract: Model quantization is a popular technique for deploying deep learning models
on resource-constrained environments. However, it may also introduce previously
overlooked security risks. In this work, we present QuRA, a novel backdoor
attack that exploits model quantization to embed malicious behaviors. Unlike
conventional backdoor attacks relying on training data poisoning or model
training manipulation, QuRA solely works using the quantization operations. In
particular, QuRA first employs a novel weight selection strategy to identify
critical weights that influence the backdoor target (with the goal of
perserving the model's overall performance in mind). Then, by optimizing the
rounding direction of these weights, we amplify the backdoor effect across
model layers without degrading accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
QuRA achieves nearly 100% attack success rates in most cases, with negligible
performance degradation. Furthermore, we show that QuRA can adapt to bypass
existing backdoor defenses, underscoring its threat potential. Our findings
highlight critical vulnerability in widely used model quantization process,
emphasizing the need for more robust security measures. Our implementation is
available at https://github.com/cxx122/QuRA.

### [858] [Data Provenance Auditing of Fine-Tuned Large Language Models with a Text-Preserving Technique](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09655)
*Yanming Li,Seifeddine Ghozzi,Cédric Eichler,Nicolas Anciaux,Alexandra Bensamoun,Lorena Gonzalez Manzano*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a watermarking framework to detect if copyrighted or sensitive texts have been used in fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). It uses invisible Unicode characters for embedding cues and replies, ensuring high accuracy in post-hoc auditing under black-box access.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide a reliable mechanism to audit the use of sensitive or copyrighted texts in fine-tuning LLMs, addressing limitations of prior methods like verbatim regurgitation and membership inference.

Method: The method involves embedding invisible Unicode-based watermarks in documents. These consist of cues and replies embedded alternately. During auditing, the presence of replies in model outputs after submitting cues serves as evidence of memorization. A ranking test ensures bounded false-positive rates.

Result: The framework demonstrates a failure rate below 0.1% for detected replies, zero spurious detections in over 18,000 tests, and maintains high detection rates even with increased dataset sizes.

Conclusion: The proposed watermarking method provides a minimally invasive, scalable, and robust solution for auditing fine-tuning processes, ensuring reliable provenance signals under black-box conditions.

Abstract: We address the problem of auditing whether sensitive or copyrighted texts
were used to fine-tune large language models (LLMs) under black-box access.
Prior signals-verbatim regurgitation and membership inference-are unreliable at
the level of individual documents or require altering the visible text. We
introduce a text-preserving watermarking framework that embeds sequences of
invisible Unicode characters into documents. Each watermark is split into a cue
(embedded in odd chunks) and a reply (embedded in even chunks). At audit time,
we submit prompts that contain only the cue; the presence of the corresponding
reply in the model's output provides evidence of memorization consistent with
training on the marked text. To obtain sound decisions, we compare the score of
the published watermark against a held-out set of counterfactual watermarks and
apply a ranking test with a provable false-positive-rate bound. The design is
(i) minimally invasive (no visible text changes), (ii) scalable to many users
and documents via a large watermark space and multi-watermark attribution, and
(iii) robust to common passive transformations. We evaluate on open-weight LLMs
and multiple text domains, analyzing regurgitation dynamics, sensitivity to
training set size, and interference under multiple concurrent watermarks. Our
results demonstrate reliable post-hoc provenance signals with bounded FPR under
black-box access. We experimentally observe a failure rate of less than 0.1\%
when detecting a reply after fine-tuning with 50 marked documents. Conversely,
no spurious reply was recovered in over 18,000 challenges, corresponding to a
100\%TPR@0\% FPR. Moreover, detection rates remain relatively stable as the
dataset size increases, maintaining a per-document detection rate above 45\%
even when the marked collection accounts for less than 0.33\% of the
fine-tuning data.

### [859] [TabVLA: Targeted Backdoor Attacks on Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10932)
*Zonghuan Xu,Xiang Zheng,Xingjun Ma,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces TabVLA, a framework for targeted backdoor attacks on Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, highlighting their vulnerability to such threats and evaluating defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA models are increasingly used in real-world embodied AI systems, but their susceptibility to targeted backdoor attacks poses significant safety risks.

Method: TabVLA uses black-box fine-tuning to implement targeted backdoor attacks. It examines two threat models and optimizes poisoned data generation to improve the effectiveness of the attacks.

Result: Experiments show that the vision channel is the main attack surface. Attacks succeed with minimal effort, are robust to trigger variations, and are only mildly affected by positional mismatches. A detection-based defense reconstructs latent triggers to identify backdoors.

Conclusion: Targeted backdoor attacks represent a serious vulnerability in VLA models. Current detection-based defenses require enhancements, underscoring the urgency for advanced protection mechanisms.

Abstract: With the growing deployment of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in
real-world embodied AI systems, their increasing vulnerability to backdoor
attacks poses a serious safety threat. A backdoored VLA agent can be covertly
triggered by a pre-injected backdoor to execute adversarial actions,
potentially causing system failures or even physical harm. Although backdoor
attacks on VLA models have been explored, prior work has focused only on
untargeted attacks, leaving the more practically threatening scenario of
targeted manipulation unexamined. In this paper, we study targeted backdoor
attacks on VLA models and introduce TabVLA, a novel framework that enables such
attacks via black-box fine-tuning. TabVLA explores two deployment-relevant
inference-time threat models: input-stream editing and in-scene triggering. It
formulates poisoned data generation as an optimization problem to improve
attack effectivess. Experiments with OpenVLA-7B on the LIBERO benchmark reveal
that the vision channel is the principal attack surface: targeted backdoors
succeed with minimal poisoning, remain robust across variations in trigger
design, and are degraded only by positional mismatches between fine-tuning and
inference triggers. We also investigate a potential detection-based defense
against TabVLA, which reconstructs latent visual triggers from the input stream
to flag activation-conditioned backdoor samples. Our work highlights the
vulnerability of VLA models to targeted backdoor manipulation and underscores
the need for more advanced defenses.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes a CNN-based method to detect rogue devices and identify genuine ones through RF fingerprinting, verified on a dataset of SDRs, despite adversarial imitation attempts using GANs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of detecting rogue devices and authenticating genuine ones using RF fingerprinting, even in scenarios where adversaries try to imitate RF characteristics.

Method: The approach uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with softmax probability thresholding, and evaluates performance in the presence of adversarial imitation attempts using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN).

Result: Validation was conducted with IQ samples from ten SDR devices, with results demonstrating successful differentiation between genuine and rogue devices.

Conclusion: The CNN-based framework effectively identifies genuine devices and detects rogue ones, even when adversaries utilize GANs to mimic genuine RF characteristics.

Abstract: Radio Frequency Fingerprinting (RFF) has evolved as an effective solution for
authenticating devices by leveraging the unique imperfections in hardware
components involved in the signal generation process. In this work, we propose
a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based framework for detecting rogue
devices and identifying genuine ones using softmax probability thresholding. We
emulate an attack scenario in which adversaries attempt to mimic the RF
characteristics of genuine devices by training a Generative Adversarial Network
(GAN) using In-phase and Quadrature (IQ) samples from genuine devices. The
proposed approach is verified using IQ samples collected from ten different
ADALM-PLUTO Software Defined Radios (SDRs), with seven devices considered
genuine, two as rogue, and one used for validation to determine the threshold.

*Haoran Ou,Kangjie Chen,Xingshuo Han,Gelei Deng,Jie Zhang,Han Qiu,Tianwei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces CREST-Search, a framework to expose risks in web-search integrated language models, addressing vulnerabilities through adversarial testing and dataset-driven refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the safety risks emerging from integrating web search capabilities into large language models, which can amplify vulnerabilities due to adversarial prompts and untrusted sources.

Method: The authors develop CREST-Search, employing in-context learning to create adversarial queries and iterative feedback to refine them. Additionally, they construct a dataset, WebSearch-Harm, to fine-tune LLMs for efficient red-teaming.

Result: The research demonstrates that CREST-Search successfully bypasses safety filters and uncovers vulnerabilities in search-enabled language models, showcasing its effectiveness in stress-testing these systems.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the urgent need for tailored defenses to ensure trustworthy deployment of web-augmented language models, given their exposed weaknesses when subjected to frameworks like CREST-Search.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at tasks such as dialogue, summarization,
and question answering, yet they struggle to adapt to specialized domains and
evolving facts. To overcome this, web search has been integrated into LLMs,
allowing real-time access to online content. However, this connection magnifies
safety risks, as adversarial prompts combined with untrusted sources can cause
severe vulnerabilities. We investigate red teaming for LLMs with web search and
present CREST-Search, a framework that systematically exposes risks in such
systems. Unlike existing methods for standalone LLMs, CREST-Search addresses
the complex workflow of search-enabled models by generating adversarial queries
with in-context learning and refining them through iterative feedback. We
further construct WebSearch-Harm, a search-specific dataset to fine-tune LLMs
into efficient red-teaming agents. Experiments show that CREST-Search
effectively bypasses safety filters and reveals vulnerabilities in modern
web-augmented LLMs, underscoring the need for specialized defenses to ensure
trustworthy deployment.

*Aofan Liu,Lulu Tang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces an adversarial image method called VisualDAN to exploit vulnerabilities in vision-language models (VLMs) by bypassing safeguards and generating malicious outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work is motivated by the unsolved challenge of securing vision-language models (VLMs) against jailbreak attacks, especially given their additional vulnerabilities introduced by multimodal integration, such as image hijacking.

Method: The method involves prepending harmful DAN-inspired textual commands with affirmative prefixes, training adversarial images on these commands, and using the images to trick models into generating malicious outputs.

Result: VisualDAN successfully bypasses the safeguards of various VLMs like MiniGPT-4 and InstructBLIP, enabling them to execute harmful instructions. Results demonstrate how even minimal toxic content can significantly amplify harmful outputs in compromised models.

Conclusion: Robust defenses against image-based attacks are urgently needed, and this work provides valuable insights for developing secure and aligned VLMs.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have garnered significant attention for their
remarkable ability to interpret and generate multimodal content. However,
securing these models against jailbreak attacks continues to be a substantial
challenge. Unlike text-only models, VLMs integrate additional modalities,
introducing novel vulnerabilities such as image hijacking, which can manipulate
the model into producing inappropriate or harmful responses. Drawing
inspiration from text-based jailbreaks like the "Do Anything Now" (DAN)
command, this work introduces VisualDAN, a single adversarial image embedded
with DAN-style commands. Specifically, we prepend harmful corpora with
affirmative prefixes (e.g., "Sure, I can provide the guidance you need") to
trick the model into responding positively to malicious queries. The
adversarial image is then trained on these DAN-inspired harmful texts and
transformed into the text domain to elicit malicious outputs. Extensive
experiments on models such as MiniGPT-4, MiniGPT-v2, InstructBLIP, and LLaVA
reveal that VisualDAN effectively bypasses the safeguards of aligned VLMs,
forcing them to execute a broad range of harmful instructions that severely
violate ethical standards. Our results further demonstrate that even a small
amount of toxic content can significantly amplify harmful outputs once the
model's defenses are compromised. These findings highlight the urgent need for
robust defenses against image-based attacks and offer critical insights for
future research into the alignment and security of VLMs.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAJD, a framework for detecting jamming attacks in O-RAN environments using AI/ML, achieving better accuracy and adaptability than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the security challenge of jamming attacks in O-RAN environments, which can degrade network performance.

Method: Developed a self-adaptive jammer detection (SAJD) framework using AI/ML, employing ML-based xApps for near-realtime jamming inference and continuous retraining via rApps.

Result: Demonstrated that SAJD outperforms existing jamming detection approaches in accuracy and adaptability under dynamic and unseen interference scenarios.

Conclusion: SAJD improves the resilience of O-RAN systems against jamming attacks by leveraging AI/ML-based adaptive detection and retraining mechanisms.

Abstract: The open radio access network (O-RAN) enables modular, intelligent, and
programmable 5G network architectures through the adoption of software-defined
networking, network function virtualization, and implementation of standardized
open interfaces. However, one of the security concerns for O-RAN, which can
severely undermine network performance, is jamming attacks. This paper presents
SAJD- a self-adaptive jammer detection framework that autonomously detects
jamming attacks in AI/ML framework-integrated ORAN environments without human
intervention. The SAJD framework forms a closed-loop system that includes
near-realtime inference of radio signal jamming via our developed ML-based
xApp, as well as continuous monitoring and retraining pipelines through rApps.
In this demonstration, we will show how SAJD outperforms state-of-the-art
jamming detection xApp (offline trained with manual labels) in terms of
accuracy and adaptability under various dynamic and previously unseen
interference scenarios in the O-RAN-compliant testbed.

TL;DR: The paper presents ArtPerception, an advanced framework for bypassing LLM security measures by using ASCII art, demonstrating the need for robust defenses against unconventional inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address vulnerabilities in LLMs caused by current safety alignments, which fail to account for non-standard data representations like ASCII art.

Method: ArtPerception uses a two-phase methodology consisting of a model-specific pre-test to determine optimal ASCII art parameters, followed by a one-shot jailbreak attack. It also introduces the Modified Levenshtein Distance (MLD) for evaluating recognition capabilities.

Result: The framework successfully bypasses security in both open-source and commercial LLMs, outperforming prior methods in jailbreak effectiveness and validating transferability across models.

Conclusion: The study underscores the importance of defending LLMs against multi-modal threats, particularly within text-only environments, and highlights the effectiveness of strategic, reconnaissance-based attack approaches.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into computer applications
has introduced transformative capabilities but also significant security
challenges. Existing safety alignments, which primarily focus on semantic
interpretation, leave LLMs vulnerable to attacks that use non-standard data
representations. This paper introduces ArtPerception, a novel black-box
jailbreak framework that strategically leverages ASCII art to bypass the
security measures of state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs. Unlike prior methods that
rely on iterative, brute-force attacks, ArtPerception introduces a systematic,
two-phase methodology. Phase 1 conducts a one-time, model-specific pre-test to
empirically determine the optimal parameters for ASCII art recognition. Phase 2
leverages these insights to launch a highly efficient, one-shot malicious
jailbreak attack. We propose a Modified Levenshtein Distance (MLD) metric for a
more nuanced evaluation of an LLM's recognition capability. Through
comprehensive experiments on four SOTA open-source LLMs, we demonstrate
superior jailbreak performance. We further validate our framework's real-world
relevance by showing its successful transferability to leading commercial
models, including GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 3.7, and DeepSeek-V3, and by conducting
a rigorous effectiveness analysis against potential defenses such as LLaMA
Guard and Azure's content filters. Our findings underscore that true LLM
security requires defending against a multi-modal space of interpretations,
even within text-only inputs, and highlight the effectiveness of strategic,
reconnaissance-based attacks. Content Warning: This paper includes potentially
harmful and offensive model outputs.

### [865] [Pharmacist: Safety Alignment Data Curation for Large Language Models against Harmful Fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10085)
*Guozhi Liu,Qi Mu,Tiansheng Huang,Xinhua Wang,Li Shen,Weiwei Lin,Zhang Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Pharmacist, a solution to improve defense against harmful fine-tuning in large language models by curating alignment datasets. Testing shows improvements in both model performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Harmful fine-tuning in large language models poses significant safety risks, yet existing defense methods often ignore the quality of the alignment data. This paper tackles this gap by addressing alignment data composition.

Method: The authors propose Pharmacist, which involves training an alignment data selector to rank and prioritize high-quality, safety-critical data while down-ranking irrelevant or low-quality data.

Result: Pharmacist-selected datasets led to notable improvements in defense performance (e.g., 2.60% increase for RepNoise, 3.30% for T-Vaccine) and inference performance, while also reducing training time by over 50%.

Conclusion: Pharmacist enhances the effectiveness of existing defense methods by optimizing alignment data selection. It improves both defense and inference metrics while significantly reducing computational costs.

Abstract: Harmful fine-tuning issues present significant safety challenges for
fine-tuning-as-a-service in large language models. Existing alignment-stage
defenses, e.g., Vaccine, Repnoise, Booster, and T-Vaccine, mitigate harmful
fine-tuning issues by enhancing the model's robustness during the alignment
phase. While these methods have been proposed to mitigate the issue, they often
overlook a critical upstream factor: the role of the original safety-alignment
data. We observe that their defense performance and computational efficiency
remain constrained by the quality and composition of the alignment dataset. To
address this limitation, we propose Pharmacist, a safety alignment data
curation solution that enhances defense against harmful fine-tuning by
selecting a high-quality and safety-critical core subset from the original
alignment data. The core idea of Pharmacist is to train an alignment data
selector to rank alignment data. Specifically, up-ranking high-quality and
safety-critical alignment data, down-ranking low-quality and
non-safety-critical data. Empirical results indicate that models trained on
datasets selected by Pharmacist outperform those trained on datasets selected
by existing selection methods in both defense and inference performance. In
addition, Pharmacist can be effectively integrated with mainstream
alignment-stage defense methods. For example, when applied to RepNoise and
T-Vaccine, using the dataset selected by Pharmacist instead of the full dataset
leads to improvements in defense performance by 2.60\% and 3.30\%,
respectively, and enhances inference performance by 3.50\% and 1.10\%. Notably,
it reduces training time by 56.83\% and 57.63\%, respectively. Our code is
available at https://github.com/Lslland/Pharmacist.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Recent reasoning-based safety guardrails in LRMs show strong defense against jailbreak attacks, but are vulnerable to subtle input manipulations, achieving high attack success rates across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vulnerabilities in reasoning-based safety mechanisms for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) and investigate their systemic weaknesses.

Method: Analysis and experimentation with various jailbreak methods (including template manipulations and automated optimizations) in different settings to test the robustness of LRMs' safety guardrails.

Result: Subtle manipulations of input prompts bypass reasoning-based guardrails with alarmingly high success rates, exceeding 90% across benchmarks on open-source gpt-oss models.

Conclusion: Reasoning-based safety guardrails for LRMs are fragile and prone to exploitation; stronger alignment techniques are urgently needed to mitigate misuse risks in open-source systems.

Abstract: Recent reasoning-based safety guardrails for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs),
such as deliberative alignment, have shown strong defense against jailbreak
attacks. By leveraging LRMs' reasoning ability, these guardrails help the
models to assess the safety of user inputs before generating final responses.
The powerful reasoning ability can analyze the intention of the input query and
will refuse to assist once it detects the harmful intent hidden by the
jailbreak methods. Such guardrails have shown a significant boost in defense,
such as the near-perfect refusal rates on the open-source gpt-oss series.
Unfortunately, we find that these powerful reasoning-based guardrails can be
extremely vulnerable to subtle manipulation of the input prompts, and once
hijacked, can lead to even more harmful results. Specifically, we first uncover
a surprisingly fragile aspect of these guardrails: simply adding a few template
tokens to the input prompt can successfully bypass the seemingly powerful
guardrails and lead to explicit and harmful responses. To explore further, we
introduce a bag of jailbreak methods that subvert the reasoning-based
guardrails. Our attacks span white-, gray-, and black-box settings and range
from effortless template manipulations to fully automated optimization. Along
with the potential for scalable implementation, these methods also achieve
alarmingly high attack success rates (e.g., exceeding 90% across 5 different
benchmarks on gpt-oss series on both local host models and online API
services). Evaluations across various leading open-source LRMs confirm that
these vulnerabilities are systemic, underscoring the urgent need for stronger
alignment techniques for open-sourced LRMs to prevent malicious misuse. Code is
open-sourced at https://chenxshuo.github.io/bag-of-tricks.

### [867] [MetaBreak: Jailbreaking Online LLM Services via Special Token Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10271)
*Wentian Zhu,Zhen Xiang,Wei Niu,Le Guan*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: MetaBreak abuses special tokens in LLMs for constructing effective attack primitives, enabling bypass of safety measures and outperforming prompt-engineering solutions in adversary environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address vulnerabilities related to special tokens in LLMs that can compromise safety and moderation systems.

Method: Introduce MetaBreak, exploiting special tokens and semantic replacements within the tokenizer’s embedding space for attacking LLM safety mechanisms.

Result: MetaBreak achieves jailbreak rates comparable to SOTA without moderation and outperforms with content moderation, boosting rates synergistically with prompt-engineering solutions.

Conclusion: MetaBreak represents a significant challenge for defending LLMs due to its novel approach and synergy with existing methods like PAP and GPTFuzzer.

Abstract: Unlike regular tokens derived from existing text corpora, special tokens are
artificially created to annotate structured conversations during the
fine-tuning process of Large Language Models (LLMs). Serving as metadata of
training data, these tokens play a crucial role in instructing LLMs to generate
coherent and context-aware responses. We demonstrate that special tokens can be
exploited to construct four attack primitives, with which malicious users can
reliably bypass the internal safety alignment of online LLM services and
circumvent state-of-the-art (SOTA) external content moderation systems
simultaneously. Moreover, we found that addressing this threat is challenging,
as aggressive defense mechanisms-such as input sanitization by removing special
tokens entirely, as suggested in academia-are less effective than anticipated.
This is because such defense can be evaded when the special tokens are replaced
by regular ones with high semantic similarity within the tokenizer's embedding
space. We systemically evaluated our method, named MetaBreak, on both lab
environment and commercial LLM platforms. Our approach achieves jailbreak rates
comparable to SOTA prompt-engineering-based solutions when no content
moderation is deployed. However, when there is content moderation, MetaBreak
outperforms SOTA solutions PAP and GPTFuzzer by 11.6% and 34.8%, respectively.
Finally, since MetaBreak employs a fundamentally different strategy from prompt
engineering, the two approaches can work synergistically. Notably, empowering
MetaBreak on PAP and GPTFuzzer boosts jailbreak rates by 24.3% and 20.2%,
respectively.

*Michel Youssef*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a risk-calibrated method for streaming intrusion detection, combining Bayesian Online Changepoint Detection (BOCPD) with decision thresholds tuned to SRE error budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intrusion detection systems face challenges in adapting to distribution shift and minimizing operational costs associated with false positives and negatives. The paper aims to align detection decisions with SRE metrics to improve efficiency.

Method: BOCPD is used for run-length posteriors, optimized using operational costs. They integrate a hazard model and conjugate updates, and provide an efficient O(1)-per-event computational implementation.

Result: The approach outperforms strong unsupervised baselines (ECOD, COPOD, LOF) on benchmark datasets like UNSW-NB15 and CIC-IDS2017, offering better precision-recall at high recall, improved calibration, and lower detection latency.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates effective intrusion detection aligned with SRE goals, addressing trade-offs between false positive/negative costs and providing actionable insights for real-world applications.

Abstract: We present a risk-calibrated approach to streaming intrusion detection that
couples Bayesian Online Changepoint Detection (BOCPD) with decision thresholds
aligned to Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) error budgets. BOCPD provides
run-length posteriors that adapt to distribution shift and concept drift; we
map these posteriors to alert decisions by optimizing expected operational cost
under false-positive and false-negative budgets. We detail the hazard model,
conjugate updates, and an O(1)-per-event implementation. A concrete SRE example
shows how a 99.9% availability SLO (43.2 minutes per month error budget) yields
a probability threshold near 0.91 when missed incidents are 10x more costly
than false alarms. We evaluate on the full UNSW-NB15 and CIC-IDS2017 benchmarks
with chronological splits, comparing against strong unsupervised baselines
(ECOD, COPOD, and LOF). Metrics include PR-AUC, ROC-AUC, Brier score,
calibration reliability diagrams, and detection latency measured in events.
Results indicate improved precision-recall at mid to high recall and better
probability calibration relative to baselines. We release implementation
details, hyperparameters, and ablations for hazard sensitivity and
computational footprint. Code and reproducibility materials will be made
available upon publication; datasets and implementation are available from the

*Tonmoy Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper addresses password security challenges by proposing a multifaceted learning-based framework for enhanced security and user engagement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Passwords remain a vulnerability due to weak compliance and improper management, necessitating better security mechanisms.

Method: The authors propose a framework combining Password Dissection Mechanism, Dynamic Password Policy Mechanism, and machine learning to build user profiles and adapt security approaches.

Result: The framework improves the usability-security balance, offering stronger protection and engaging users in security policy-setting.

Conclusion: The proposed solution revolutionizes password security by enhancing both compliance and effectiveness with its adaptive, user-centric design.

Abstract: Password security has been compelled to evolve in response to the growing
computational capabilities of modern systems. However, this evolution has often
resulted in increasingly complex security practices that alienate users,
leading to poor compliance and heightened vulnerability. Consequently,
individuals remain exposed to attackers through weak or improperly managed
passwords, underscoring the urgent need for a comprehensive defense mechanism
that effectively addresses password-related risks and threats. In this paper,
we propose a multifaceted solution designed to revolutionize password security
by integrating diverse attributes such as the Password Dissection Mechanism,
Dynamic Password Policy Mechanism, human behavioral patterns, device
characteristics, network parameters, geographical context, and other relevant
factors. By leveraging learning-based models, our framework constructs detailed
user profiles capable of recognizing individuals and preventing nearly all
forms of unauthorized access or device possession. The proposed framework
enhances the usability-security paradigm by offering stronger protection than
existing standards while simultaneously engaging users in the policy-setting
process through a novel, adaptive approach.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark called \tool{} to evaluate the security vulnerabilities of large vision-language model (LVLM)-based web agents, addressing limitations of narrow existing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to address the lack of holistic security evaluation frameworks for LVLM-based web agents, which face significant risks in practical deployment due to adversarial manipulations.

Method: The authors developed \tool{}, comprising six realistic web environments, 2,970 diverse trajectories, a taxonomy of six attack vectors, and a multi-layered evaluation protocol analyzing reasoning, trajectory, and task outcomes.

Result: Experiments conducted on nine LVLMs revealed consistent vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks, highlighting trade-offs between model specialization and security robustness.

Conclusion: \tool{} serves as a benchmark for assessing and improving the security of LVLMs, paving the way for more trustworthy web agent deployment.

Abstract: Large vision-language model (LVLM)-based web agents are emerging as powerful
tools for automating complex online tasks. However, when deployed in real-world
environments, they face serious security risks, motivating the design of
security evaluation benchmarks. Existing benchmarks provide only partial
coverage, typically restricted to narrow scenarios such as user-level prompt
manipulation, and thus fail to capture the broad range of agent
vulnerabilities. To address this gap, we present \tool{}, the first holistic
benchmark for evaluating the security of LVLM-based web agents. \tool{} first
introduces a unified evaluation suite comprising six simulated but realistic
web environments (\eg, e-commerce platforms, community forums) and includes
2,970 high-quality trajectories spanning diverse tasks and attack settings. The
suite defines a structured taxonomy of six attack vectors spanning both
user-level and environment-level manipulations. In addition, we introduce a
multi-layered evaluation protocol that analyzes agent failures across three
critical dimensions: internal reasoning, behavioral trajectory, and task
outcome, facilitating a fine-grained risk analysis that goes far beyond simple
success metrics. Using this benchmark, we conduct large-scale experiments on 9
representative LVLMs, which fall into three categories: general-purpose,
agent-specialized, and GUI-grounded. Our results show that all tested agents
are consistently vulnerable to subtle adversarial manipulations and reveal
critical trade-offs between model specialization and security. By providing (1)
a comprehensive benchmark suite with diverse environments and a multi-layered
evaluation pipeline, and (2) empirical insights into the security challenges of
modern LVLM-based web agents, \tool{} establishes a foundation for advancing
trustworthy web agent deployment.

*Ming Tan,Wei Li,Hu Tao,Hailong Ma,Aodi Liu,Qian Chen,Zilong Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper investigates vulnerabilities of open-source large language models (LLMs) to stego attacks and introduces an efficient attack method called SASER.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing concern of security risks in open-source LLMs by understanding how they can be exploited using stego attacks.

Method: The authors formalized threat models for stego attacks, illustrating adversary techniques for payload injection, and introduced SASER—a tailored attack with improved stealth and robustness, including mechanisms like de-quantization and importance metrics.

Result: SASER achieves a 98.1% stealth rate over existing methods without compromising attack success rate (ASR) of 100%, and significantly improves ASR in quantized models from 0% to 100%.

Conclusion: SASER poses a significant threat to open-source LLMs, necessitating investigations into effective defenses against such sophisticated attacks.

Abstract: Open-source large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable
dominance over proprietary LLMs in resolving neural processing tasks, thanks to
the collaborative and sharing nature. Although full access to source codes,
model parameters, and training data lays the groundwork for transparency, we
argue that such a full-access manner is vulnerable to stego attacks, and their
ill-effects are not fully understood. In this paper, we conduct a systematic
formalization for stego attacks on open-source LLMs by enumerating all possible
threat models associated with adversary objectives, knowledge, and
capabilities. Therein, the threat posed by adversaries with internal knowledge,
who inject payloads and triggers during the model sharing phase, is of
practical interest. We go even further and propose the first stego attack on
open-source LLMs, dubbed SASER, which wields impacts through identifying
targeted parameters, embedding payloads, injecting triggers, and executing
payloads sequentially. Particularly, SASER enhances the attack robustness
against quantization-based local deployment by de-quantizing the embedded
payloads. In addition, to achieve stealthiness, SASER devises the
performance-aware importance metric to identify targeted parameters with the
least degradation of model performance. Extensive experiments on LlaMA2-7B and
ChatGLM3-6B, without quantization, show that the stealth rate of SASER
outperforms existing stego attacks (for general DNNs) by up to 98.1%, while
achieving the same attack success rate (ASR) of 100%. More importantly, SASER
improves ASR on quantized models from 0 to 100% in all settings. We appeal for
investigations on countermeasures against SASER in view of the significant
attack effectiveness.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This study develops an adaptive detection method for GPS spoofing attacks on autonomous vehicles using a dynamically tuned DBSCAN algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As autonomous vehicles integrate into modern transport, they face growing security issues like GPS spoofing attacks, necessitating robust detection methods.

Method: A DBSCAN algorithm with a dynamically tuned detection threshold ({\epsilon}), updated in real-time using displacement error metrics, was designed. The method uses an initial threshold from clean data and modifies it based on real-time non-anomalous data.

Result: The method demonstrated high detection accuracy (98.38%-99.96%) across various GPS spoofing scenarios using real-world Honda Research Institute Driving Dataset (HDD).

Conclusion: The proposed approach significantly enhances the detection and prevention of GPS spoofing in autonomous vehicles, strengthening their security and reliability.

Abstract: As autonomous vehicles become an essential component of modern
transportation, they are increasingly vulnerable to threats such as GPS
spoofing attacks. This study presents an adaptive detection approach utilizing
a dynamically tuned Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise
(DBSCAN) algorithm, designed to adjust the detection threshold ({\epsilon}) in
real-time. The threshold is updated based on the recursive mean and standard
deviation of displacement errors between GPS and in-vehicle sensors data, but
only at instances classified as non-anomalous. Furthermore, an initial
threshold, determined from 120,000 clean data samples, ensures the capability
to identify even subtle and gradual GPS spoofing attempts from the beginning.
To assess the performance of the proposed method, five different subsets from
the real-world Honda Research Institute Driving Dataset (HDD) are selected to
simulate both large and small magnitude GPS spoofing attacks. The modified
algorithm effectively identifies turn-by-turn, stop, overshoot, and multiple
small biased spoofing attacks, achieving detection accuracies of 98.621%,
99.960.1%, 99.880.1%, and 98.380.1%, respectively. This work provides a
substantial advancement in enhancing the security and safety of AVs against GPS
spoofing threats.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The study investigates authorship attribution for JavaScript code generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), demonstrating that models leave unique stylistic fingerprints even after code transformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing need for reliable authorship attribution in AI-generated code, which is crucial for detecting vulnerabilities, managing malicious content, and ensuring accountability.

Method: Created LLM-NodeJS, a dataset of 50,000 Node.js programs across 20 LLMs, with variations and additional representations, and introduced CodeT5-JSA, a custom architecture for classification tasks.

Result: CodeT5-JSA achieved high attribution accuracy (up to 95.8%) and proved effective even under heavy code transformations, outperforming other models like BERT and CodeBERT.

Conclusion: LLMs leave distinct stylistic imprints in code that can be detected for reliable attribution, benefiting cybersecurity, accountability, and open science initiatives.

Abstract: In this paper, we present the first large-scale study exploring whether
JavaScript code generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) can reveal which
model produced it, enabling reliable authorship attribution and model
fingerprinting. With the rapid rise of AI-generated code, attribution is
playing a critical role in detecting vulnerabilities, flagging malicious
content, and ensuring accountability. While AI-vs-human detection usually
treats AI as a single category we show that individual LLMs leave unique
stylistic signatures, even among models belonging to the same family or
parameter size. To this end, we introduce LLM-NodeJS, a dataset of 50,000
Node.js back-end programs from 20 large language models. Each has four
transformed variants, yielding 250,000 unique JavaScript samples and two
additional representations (JSIR and AST) for diverse research applications.
Using this dataset, we benchmark traditional machine learning classifiers
against fine-tuned Transformer encoders and introduce CodeT5-JSA, a custom
architecture derived from the 770M-parameter CodeT5 model with its decoder
removed and a modified classification head. It achieves 95.8% accuracy on
five-class attribution, 94.6% on ten-class, and 88.5% on twenty-class tasks,
surpassing other tested models such as BERT, CodeBERT, and Longformer. We
demonstrate that classifiers capture deeper stylistic regularities in program
dataflow and structure, rather than relying on surface-level features. As a
result, attribution remains effective even after mangling, comment removal, and
heavy code transformations. To support open science and reproducibility, we
release the LLM-NodeJS dataset, Google Colab training scripts, and all related
materials on GitHub: https://github.com/LLM-NodeJS-dataset.

*Hyeseon Ahn,Shinwoo Park,Yo-Sub Han*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper identifies and demonstrates the threat of watermark spoofing in LLMs, where attackers manipulate models to create texts that bear fake watermarks of trusted sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose the security vulnerabilities in current watermarking approaches for text generated by LLMs, including the possible misuse for misattributing harmful content.

Method: The authors developed a framework leveraging watermark radioactivity through knowledge distillation from a watermarked teacher model to replicate its watermarking signal in an attacker’s model.

Result: The framework successfully enabled the malicious replication of watermarks, showcasing the feasibility of watermark spoofing and undermining the reliability of watermark-based authorship verification.

Conclusion: The paper stresses the need for more robust technologies to differentiate authentic watermarks from imitations, highlighting a critical flaw in current authorship verification practices.

Abstract: The promise of LLM watermarking rests on a core assumption that a specific
watermark proves authorship by a specific model. We demonstrate that this
assumption is dangerously flawed. We introduce the threat of watermark
spoofing, a sophisticated attack that allows a malicious model to generate text
containing the authentic-looking watermark of a trusted, victim model. This
enables the seamless misattribution of harmful content, such as disinformation,
to reputable sources. The key to our attack is repurposing watermark
radioactivity, the unintended inheritance of data patterns during fine-tuning,
from a discoverable trait into an attack vector. By distilling knowledge from a
watermarked teacher model, our framework allows an attacker to steal and
replicate the watermarking signal of the victim model. This work reveals a
critical security gap in text authorship verification and calls for a paradigm
shift towards technologies capable of distinguishing authentic watermarks from
expertly imitated ones. Our code is available at

*Rui Xu,Jiawei Chen,Zhaoxia Yin,Cong Kong,Xinpeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: CodeMark-LLM introduces an LLM-based watermarking framework for source code, addressing ethical concerns and achieving robustness, scalability, and cross-language capabilities against malicious redistribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to ensure ethical and secure distribution of open-source code, avoiding unauthorized redistribution, license violations, and malicious misuse, drives the development of an effective source attribution mechanism.

Method: CodeMark-LLM utilizes two core components: a Semantically Consistent Embedding module for encoding watermark bits via functionality-preserving transformations, and a Differential Comparison Extraction module for identifying transformations by comparing original and watermarked code.

Result: Through experiments across various programming languages and attack scenarios, CodeMark-LLM demonstrates robust watermarking, effective source attribution, scalability, and resilience against attacks.

Conclusion: CodeMark-LLM represents a scalable and generalizable LLM-driven solution for ethical and secure source attribution in open-source code, overcoming limitations of traditional watermarking techniques.

Abstract: The widespread use of large language models (LLMs) and open-source code has
raised ethical and security concerns regarding the distribution and attribution
of source code, including unauthorized redistribution, license violations, and
misuse of code for malicious purposes. Watermarking has emerged as a promising
solution for source attribution, but existing techniques rely heavily on
hand-crafted transformation rules, abstract syntax tree (AST) manipulation, or
task-specific training, limiting their scalability and generality across
languages. Moreover, their robustness against attacks remains limited. To
address these limitations, we propose CodeMark-LLM, an LLM-driven watermarking
framework that embeds watermark into source code without compromising its
semantics or readability. CodeMark-LLM consists of two core components: (i)
Semantically Consistent Embedding module that applies functionality-preserving
transformations to encode watermark bits, and (ii) Differential Comparison
Extraction module that identifies the applied transformations by comparing the
original and watermarked code. Leveraging the cross-lingual generalization
ability of LLM, CodeMark-LLM avoids language-specific engineering and training
pipelines. Extensive experiments across diverse programming languages and
attack scenarios demonstrate its robustness, effectiveness, and scalability.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: RAG-Pull is a new black-box attack method targeting Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models. It uses hidden UTF characters in queries or data to redirect retrieval towards malicious content, compromising model safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore potential vulnerabilities in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models, especially how their external data reliance can be exploited to bypass safety measures.

Method: The paper designs a black-box attack, RAG-Pull, involving inserting hidden UTF characters in queries or external repositories to manipulate retrieval towards attacker-controlled malicious code.

Result: RAG-Pull manipulates retrieval effectively, achieving near-perfect success when used with combined query and target perturbations, leading to vulnerabilities like remote code execution and SQL injection.

Conclusion: RAG systems are vulnerable to targeted attacks like RAG-Pull, which can compromise model reliability, emphasizing the need for stronger safety measures.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) increases the reliability and
trustworthiness of the LLM response and reduces hallucination by eliminating
the need for model retraining. It does so by adding external data into the
LLM's context. We develop a new class of black-box attack, RAG-Pull, that
inserts hidden UTF characters into queries or external code repositories,
redirecting retrieval toward malicious code, thereby breaking the models'
safety alignment. We observe that query and code perturbations alone can shift
retrieval toward attacker-controlled snippets, while combined query-and-target
perturbations achieve near-perfect success. Once retrieved, these snippets
introduce exploitable vulnerabilities such as remote code execution and SQL
injection. RAG-Pull's minimal perturbations can alter the model's safety
alignment and increase preference towards unsafe code, therefore opening up a
new class of attacks on LLMs.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper discusses future security concerns about threat actors using on-device LLMs in living off the land attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing presence of on-device LLMs poses a risk as threat actors might leverage them for malicious activities.

Method: Exploration of scenarios where on-device LLMs are exploited and discussion of potential mitigation strategies.

Result: Analysis shows threat actors could integrate on-device LLMs into existing attack methodologies, making detection harder.

Conclusion: Security communities need proactive strategies to address emerging risks posed by on-device LLM exploitation.

Abstract: In living off the land attacks, malicious actors use legitimate tools and

*Zicheng Liu,Lige Huang,Jie Zhang,Dongrui Liu,Yuan Tian,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces PACEbench, a realistic benchmark for assessing LLMs' cyber defense capabilities, and finds that current models struggle to meet these challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for rigorous evaluation of LLMs’ abilities in real-world cybersecurity scenarios, as existing benchmarks lack complexity.

Method: PACEbench, a benchmark with varied cyber-exploitation scenarios, and PACEagent, a model emulating human penetration testers, were developed and tested using seven advanced LLMs.

Result: Experiments reveal that current LLMs struggle with complex cyber scenarios and cannot bypass defenses.

Conclusion: Modern LLMs do not yet pose a generalized cyber offense threat, but PACEbench provides a tool for developing future trustworthy models.

Abstract: The increasing autonomy of Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitates a
rigorous evaluation of their potential to aid in cyber offense. Existing
benchmarks often lack real-world complexity and are thus unable to accurately
assess LLMs' cybersecurity capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce
PACEbench, a practical AI cyber-exploitation benchmark built on the principles
of realistic vulnerability difficulty, environmental complexity, and cyber
defenses. Specifically, PACEbench comprises four scenarios spanning single,
blended, chained, and defense vulnerability exploitations. To handle these
complex challenges, we propose PACEagent, a novel agent that emulates human
penetration testers by supporting multi-phase reconnaissance, analysis, and
exploitation. Extensive experiments with seven frontier LLMs demonstrate that
current models struggle with complex cyber scenarios, and none can bypass
defenses. These findings suggest that current models do not yet pose a
generalized cyber offense threat. Nonetheless, our work provides a robust
benchmark to guide the trustworthy development of future models.

### [879] [Robust Exploratory Stopping under Ambiguity in Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10260)
*Junyan Ye,Hoi Ying Wong,Kyunghyun Park*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper proposes a continuous-time reinforcement learning framework for addressing optimal stopping problems under ambiguity, reformulates it using $g$-expectation, and develops a robust algorithm validated through numerical experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address optimal stopping problems under ambiguity, where decisions must consider both multiple probability measures and the need for adaptive learning about the environment.

Method: The authors use the $g$-expectation framework to reformulate the optimal stopping problem into an entropy-regularized control problem with Bernoulli-distributed controls, derive solutions through backward stochastic differential equations, and propose a reinforcement learning algorithm with policy iteration.

Result: The proposed reinforcement learning algorithm demonstrates convergence and robustness across various levels of environmental ambiguity and exploration in numerical experiments.

Conclusion: This framework successfully integrates robust decision-making and learning into a continuous-time setting for optimal stopping problems under ambiguity, showing promising practical and theoretical utility.

Abstract: We propose and analyze a continuous-time robust reinforcement learning
framework for optimal stopping problems under ambiguity. In this framework, an
agent chooses a stopping rule motivated by two objectives: robust
decision-making under ambiguity and learning about the unknown environment.
Here, ambiguity refers to considering multiple probability measures dominated
by a reference measure, reflecting the agent's awareness that the reference
measure representing her learned belief about the environment would be
erroneous. Using the $g$-expectation framework, we reformulate an optimal
stopping problem under ambiguity as an entropy-regularized optimal control
problem under ambiguity, with Bernoulli distributed controls to incorporate
exploration into the stopping rules. We then derive the optimal Bernoulli
distributed control characterized by backward stochastic differential
equations. Moreover, we establish a policy iteration theorem and implement it
as a reinforcement learning algorithm. Numerical experiments demonstrate the
convergence and robustness of the proposed algorithm across different levels of
ambiguity and exploration.

*Abbas Khademi,Antonio Silveti-Falls*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper introduces an adaptive step-size strategy for first-order optimization, targeting non-Euclidean geometries with convergence guarantees and competitive numerical performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Step-size selection in first-order optimization is crucial, particularly for problems involving non-Euclidean geometries, where traditional methods may lack effectiveness.

Method: The authors propose an Adaptive Conditional Gradient Descent algorithm that uses a heuristic to estimate local Lipschitz constants for the gradient, ensuring sufficient decrease at each iteration. The algorithm extends classical approaches by adapting step-sizes dynamically.

Result: The method achieves convergence guarantees across non-convex, quasar-convex, and strongly convex settings, with rates matching theoretical benchmarks. Numerical experiments show competitive performance in practice.

Conclusion: The adaptive step-size strategy significantly enhances optimization algorithms with linear minimization oracles, demonstrating theoretical and practical robustness for diverse settings, including non-Euclidean geometries.

Abstract: Selecting an effective step-size is a fundamental challenge in first-order
optimization, especially for problems with non-Euclidean geometries. This paper
presents a novel adaptive step-size strategy for optimization algorithms that
rely on linear minimization oracles, as used in the Conditional Gradient or
non-Euclidean Normalized Steepest Descent algorithms. Using a simple heuristic
to estimate a local Lipschitz constant for the gradient, we can determine
step-sizes that guarantee sufficient decrease at each iteration. More
precisely, we establish convergence guarantees for our proposed Adaptive
Conditional Gradient Descent algorithm, which covers as special cases both the
classical Conditional Gradient algorithm and non-Euclidean Normalized Steepest
Descent algorithms with adaptive step-sizes. Our analysis covers optimization
of continuously differentiable functions in non-convex, quasar-convex, and
strongly convex settings, achieving convergence rates that match
state-of-the-art theoretical bounds. Comprehensive numerical experiments
validate our theoretical findings and illustrate the practical effectiveness of
Adaptive Conditional Gradient Descent. The results exhibit competitive
performance, underscoring the potential of the adaptive step-size for
applications.

*Chuan He,Zhaosong Lu*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that a vanilla stochastic algorithm, without modifications like clipping or normalization, achieves optimal complexity for convex composite optimization problems under heavy-tailed noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether additional algorithmic modifications, such as clipping or normalization, are necessary to handle heavy-tailed noise in convex composite optimization.

Method: The paper uses theoretical analysis to show that an accelerated stochastic proximal subgradient method achieves universally optimal first-order oracle complexity, validated through numerical experiments.

Result: The accelerated stochastic proximal subgradient method reaches optimal complexity for various convex settings, including smooth, weakly smooth, nonsmooth, and stochastic optimization with heavy-tailed noise.

Conclusion: Sophisticated noise-handling techniques are unnecessary, as a carefully designed but simple stochastic algorithm can perform optimally in challenging optimization scenarios.

Abstract: We study convex composite optimization problems, where the objective function
is given by the sum of a prox-friendly function and a convex function whose
subgradients are estimated under heavy-tailed noise. Existing work often
employs gradient clipping or normalization techniques in stochastic first-order
methods to address heavy-tailed noise. In this paper, we demonstrate that a
vanilla stochastic algorithm -- without additional modifications such as
clipping or normalization -- can achieve optimal complexity for these problems.
In particular, we establish that an accelerated stochastic proximal subgradient
method achieves a first-order oracle complexity that is universally optimal for
smooth, weakly smooth, and nonsmooth convex optimization, as well as for
stochastic convex optimization under heavy-tailed noise. Numerical experiments
are further provided to validate our theoretical results.

### [882] [Distributionally Robust Control with End-to-End Statistically Guaranteed Metric Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10214)
*Jingyi Wu,Chao Ning,Yang Shi*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper introduces an enhanced Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Control framework, integrating ambiguity set construction with control tasks for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional Wasserstein DRC approaches result in conservative policies due to structural misalignments between ambiguity set construction and control objectives.

Method: An end-to-end bilevel program framework that combines anisotropic Wasserstein metric learning with control tasks in a closed-loop manner, solved using a stochastic augmented Lagrangian algorithm.

Result: The framework demonstrates better closed-loop performance and robustness in experiments, with proven statistical guarantees and algorithmic convergence.

Conclusion: The integration of ambiguity set learning with control objectives enables effective and robust control policies, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Wasserstein distributionally robust control (DRC) recently emerges as a
principled paradigm for handling uncertainty in stochastic dynamical systems.
However, it constructs data-driven ambiguity sets via uniform distribution
shifts before sequentially incorporating them into downstream control
synthesis. This segregation between ambiguity set construction and control
objectives inherently introduces a structural misalignment, which undesirably
leads to conservative control policies with sub-optimal performance. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel end-to-end finite-horizon Wasserstein DRC
framework that integrates the learning of anisotropic Wasserstein metrics with
downstream control tasks in a closed-loop manner, thus enabling ambiguity sets
to be systematically adjusted along performance-critical directions and
yielding more effective control policies. This framework is formulated as a
bilevel program: the inner level characterizes dynamical system evolution under
DRC, while the outer level refines the anisotropic metric leveraging
control-performance feedback across a range of initial conditions. To solve
this program efficiently, we develop a stochastic augmented Lagrangian
algorithm tailored to the bilevel structure. Theoretically, we prove that the
learned ambiguity sets preserve statistical finite-sample guarantees under a
novel radius adjustment mechanism, and we establish the well-posedness of the
bilevel formulation by demonstrating its continuity with respect to the
learnable metric. Furthermore, we show that the algorithm converges to
stationary points of the outer level problem, which are statistically
consistent with the optimal metric at a non-asymptotic convergence rate.
Experiments on both numerical and inventory control tasks verify that the
proposed framework achieves superior closed-loop performance and robustness
compared against state-of-the-art methods.

### [883] [Second-order Optimization under Heavy-Tailed Noise: Hessian Clipping and Sample Complexity Limits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10690)
*Abdurakhmon Sadiev,Peter Richtárik,Ilyas Fatkhullin*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper tackles the challenge of heavy-tailed noise in machine learning, proposing a variant of normalized stochastic gradient descent and an algorithm using gradient and Hessian clipping to improve robustness and efficiency of second-order optimization under heavy-tailed noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Second-order optimization methods significantly accelerate convergence under light-tailed noise but fail in heavy-tailed settings, which are common in real-world machine learning scenarios. This study aims to bridge the theoretical gap for these methods under heavy-tailed noise.

Method: The paper establishes sample complexity lower bounds for second-order methods in settings with bounded p-th moments for gradients and Hessians. It develops a new algorithm involving gradient and Hessian clipping, along with a variant of normalized stochastic gradient descent to address instability issues.

Result: The proposed methods align with the established lower bounds for sample complexity, showing robustness under heavy-tailed noise. High-probability upper bounds are provided to validate their effectiveness.

Conclusion: The results highlight Hessian clipping as a robust approach for designing second-order optimization algorithms in the presence of heavy-tailed noise, backed by sound theoretical evidence.

Abstract: Heavy-tailed noise is pervasive in modern machine learning applications,
arising from data heterogeneity, outliers, and non-stationary stochastic
environments. While second-order methods can significantly accelerate
convergence in light-tailed or bounded-noise settings, such algorithms are
often brittle and lack guarantees under heavy-tailed noise -- precisely the
regimes where robustness is most critical. In this work, we take a first step
toward a theoretical understanding of second-order optimization under
heavy-tailed noise. We consider a setting where stochastic gradients and
Hessians have only bounded $p$-th moments, for some $p\in (1,2]$, and establish
tight lower bounds on the sample complexity of any second-order method. We then
develop a variant of normalized stochastic gradient descent that leverages
second-order information and provably matches these lower bounds. To address
the instability caused by large deviations, we introduce a novel algorithm
based on gradient and Hessian clipping, and prove high-probability upper bounds
that nearly match the fundamental limits. Our results provide the first
comprehensive sample complexity characterization for second-order optimization
under heavy-tailed noise. This positions Hessian clipping as a robust and
theoretically sound strategy for second-order algorithm design in heavy-tailed
regimes.

*Nicholas Pischke*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper extends a stochastic variant of the proximal point algorithm to Hadamard spaces, proving convergence rates under specific assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to generalize stochastic proximal point methods used in Hilbert spaces to more complex spaces such as Hadamard spaces, bridging the gap between theory in these spaces.

Method: The authors define the proximal point algorithm in separable Hadamard spaces and provide a convergence proof under strong monotonicity and probabilistic independence assumptions.

Result: Convergence of the algorithm is proven, with effective construction of explicit convergence rates in both mean and almost surely, and generality even in Hilbert spaces.

Conclusion: The paper generalizes convergence proofs for proximal algorithms, introduces uniform convergence rates, and discusses specific applications such as stochastic convex minimization.

Abstract: We define a stochastic variant of the proximal point algorithm in the general
setting of nonlinear (separable) Hadamard spaces for approximating zeros of the
mean of a stochastically perturbed monotone vector field and prove its
convergence under a suitable strong monotonicity assumption, together with a
probabilistic independence assumption and a separability assumption on the
tangent spaces. As a particular case, our results transfer previous work by P.
Bianchi on that method in Hilbert spaces for the first time to Hadamard
manifolds. Moreover, our convergence proof is fully effective and allows for
the construction of explicit rates of convergence for the iteration towards the
(unique) solution both in mean and almost surely. These rates are moreover
highly uniform, being independent of most data surrounding the iteration, space
or distribution. In that generality, these rates are novel already in the
context of Hilbert spaces. Linear nonasymptotic guarantees under additional
second-moment conditions on the Yosida approximates and special cases of
stochastic convex minimization are discussed.

*Zhigang Cheng,Mingchao Sun,Yu Liu,Zengye Ge,Luyang Tang,Mu Xu,Yangyan Li,Peng Pan*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces CLoD-GS, a framework leveraging a continuous Level of Detail (CLoD) approach in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to eliminate traditional drawbacks like storage overhead and visual artifacts in rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Level of Detail (LoD) rendering techniques suffer from visual 'popping' artifacts and high storage demands due to their reliance on discrete levels of models.

Method: The authors propose a continuous LoD mechanism that employs a learnable decay parameter for Gaussian primitives, dynamically adjusting opacity with viewpoint proximity. Training employs virtual distance scaling and a coarse-to-fine strategy with point count regularization.

Result: The proposed method achieves smooth, scalable rendering quality from a single model, reducing storage, avoiding visual artifacts, and lowering memory usage.

Conclusion: CLoD-GS delivers high-fidelity, scalable rendering by overcoming key limitations of traditional discrete LoD techniques, demonstrating its efficiency and effectiveness across diverse performance goals.

Abstract: Level of Detail (LoD) is a fundamental technique in real-time computer
graphics for managing the rendering costs of complex scenes while preserving
visual fidelity. Traditionally, LoD is implemented using discrete levels
(DLoD), where multiple, distinct versions of a model are swapped out at
different distances. This long-standing paradigm, however, suffers from two
major drawbacks: it requires significant storage for multiple model copies and
causes jarring visual ``popping" artifacts during transitions, degrading the
user experience. We argue that the explicit, primitive-based nature of the
emerging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) technique enables a more ideal paradigm:
Continuous LoD (CLoD). A CLoD approach facilitates smooth, seamless quality
scaling within a single, unified model, thereby circumventing the core problems
of DLOD. To this end, we introduce CLoD-GS, a framework that integrates a
continuous LoD mechanism directly into a 3DGS representation. Our method
introduces a learnable, distance-dependent decay parameter for each Gaussian
primitive, which dynamically adjusts its opacity based on viewpoint proximity.
This allows for the progressive and smooth filtering of less significant
primitives, effectively creating a continuous spectrum of detail within one
model. To train this model to be robust across all distances, we introduce a
virtual distance scaling mechanism and a novel coarse-to-fine training strategy
with rendered point count regularization. Our approach not only eliminates the
storage overhead and visual artifacts of discrete methods but also reduces the
primitive count and memory footprint of the final model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that CLoD-GS achieves smooth, quality-scalable rendering from a
single model, delivering high-fidelity results across a wide range of
performance targets.

*Shelly Golan,Yotam Nitzan,Zongze Wu,Or Patashnik*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces VLM-Guided Adaptive Negative-Prompting, an inference-time method to enhance creativity in image generation by steering diffusion models away from conventional visual concepts, resulting in novel and valid outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image models struggle to generate genuinely novel content, as they either rely on restricted feature interpolation or require extensive fine-tuning, limiting creative exploration.

Method: The proposed method employs a vision-language model (VLM) to analyze and adaptively steer intermediate outputs of the image generation process, avoiding conventional concepts and enabling creative outputs without additional training.

Result: Experiments demonstrate consistent improvements in creativity (measured by novelty and validity) with minimal computational overhead. The method also performs well in complex scenarios requiring coherent or compositional outputs.

Conclusion: The method offers a practical, efficient solution for enhancing creative generation in diffusion pipelines, enabling novel outputs that go beyond textual descriptions and predefined categories.

Abstract: Creative generation is the synthesis of new, surprising, and valuable samples
that reflect user intent yet cannot be envisioned in advance. This task aims to
extend human imagination, enabling the discovery of visual concepts that exist
in the unexplored spaces between familiar domains. While text-to-image
diffusion models excel at rendering photorealistic scenes that faithfully match
user prompts, they still struggle to generate genuinely novel content. Existing
approaches to enhance generative creativity either rely on interpolation of
image features, which restricts exploration to predefined categories, or
require time-intensive procedures such as embedding optimization or model
fine-tuning. We propose VLM-Guided Adaptive Negative-Prompting, a
training-free, inference-time method that promotes creative image generation
while preserving the validity of the generated object. Our approach utilizes a
vision-language model (VLM) that analyzes intermediate outputs of the
generation process and adaptively steers it away from conventional visual
concepts, encouraging the emergence of novel and surprising outputs. We
evaluate creativity through both novelty and validity, using statistical
metrics in the CLIP embedding space. Through extensive experiments, we show
consistent gains in creative novelty with negligible computational overhead.
Moreover, unlike existing methods that primarily generate single objects, our
approach extends to complex scenarios, such as generating coherent sets of
creative objects and preserving creativity within elaborate compositional
prompts. Our method integrates seamlessly into existing diffusion pipelines,
offering a practical route to producing creative outputs that venture beyond
the constraints of textual descriptions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces VCB Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate Chinese large audio language models (LALMs) across instruction following, knowledge understanding, and robustness using real human speech.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LALMs are English-focused, rely on synthetic speech, and lack diverse evaluation dimensions, creating gaps for robust multimodal assessment in non-English contexts.

Method: The authors developed VCB Bench as a high-quality Chinese benchmark using real human speech and assessed LALMs on instruction following, knowledge understanding, and robustness dimensions.

Result: Experiments revealed significant performance gaps in current LALMs, emphasizing areas for improvement and advancing Chinese voice conversational models.

Conclusion: VCB Bench serves as a reproducible and standardized evaluation framework, offering utility and insights for improving Chinese multimodal conversational systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in large audio language models (LALMs) have greatly enhanced
multimodal conversational systems. However, existing benchmarks remain limited
-- they are mainly English-centric, rely on synthetic speech, and lack
comprehensive, discriminative evaluation across multiple dimensions. To address
these gaps, we present Voice Chat Bot Bench (VCB Bench) -- a high-quality
Chinese benchmark built entirely on real human speech. VCB Bench evaluates
LALMs from three complementary perspectives: instruction following (including
speech-level control beyond text commands), knowledge understanding (general
knowledge, reasoning, and daily dialogue), and robustness (stability under
perturbations in content, environment, and speaker traits). Experiments on
representative LALMs reveal notable performance gaps and highlight future
directions for improvement. VCB Bench provides a reproducible and fine-grained
evaluation framework, offering standardized methodology and practical insights
for advancing Chinese voice conversational models.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces Diffusion-Link, a diffusion-based module that bridges the gap between audio and text embeddings. It enhances the coupling between multimodal encoders and large language models (LLMs), achieving state-of-the-art results in Automatic Audio Captioning (AAC) tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the persistent gap in joint audio and text modality embeddings, which limits the integration of multimodal encoders with LLMs.

Method: Developed Diffusion-Link, a lightweight generative module using diffusion models, with three residual MLP blocks that refine audio embeddings to align with the text-embedding distribution.

Result: Diffusion-Link significantly reduces the audio-text modality gap and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the AudioCaps dataset in zero-shot and supervised setups, with up to 52.5% and 7.5% relative gains, respectively.

Conclusion: Closing the audio-text modality gap is critical for enhancing multimodal encoders' compatibility with LLMs. Diffusion-based bridging methods like Diffusion-Link show great promise and outperform knowledge-retrieval-centric approaches.

Abstract: Contrastive audio-language pretraining yields powerful joint representations,
yet a persistent audio-text modality gap limits the benefits of coupling
multimodal encoders with large language models (LLMs). We present
Diffusion-Link, a diffusion-based modality-bridging module that generatively
maps audio embeddings into the text-embedding distribution. The module is
trained at the output embedding from the frozen multimodal encoder and
implemented as a lightweight network with three residual MLP blocks. To assess
the effect of Diffusion-Link on multimodal encoder-LLM coupling, we evaluate on
Automatic Audio Captioning (AAC); to our knowledge, this is the first
application of diffusion-based modality bridging to AAC. We report two results.
(1) Modality-gap analysis: on similarity and geometric criteria, Diffusion-Link
reduces the modality gap the most among prior diffusion-based methods and shows
a collective migration of audio embeddings toward the text distribution. (2)
Downstream AAC: attaching Diffusion-Link to the same multimodal LLM baseline
achieves state-of-the-art on AudioCaps in both zero-shot and fully supervised
captioning without external knowledge, with relative gains up to 52.5% and
7.5%, respectively. These findings show that closing the modality gap is
pivotal for effective coupling between multimodal encoders and LLMs, and
diffusion-based modality bridging offers a promising direction beyond
knowledge-retrieval-centric designs. Code will be released upon acceptance

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper presents MARS-Sep, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for universal sound separation that addresses semantic contamination by optimizing policies for semantic consistency rather than just signal metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional sound separation models often produce semantically incorrect outputs due to the mismatch between optimizing for signal fidelity and perceptual semantic alignment.

Method: MARS-Sep reformulates sound separation as a decision-making problem using RL. It employs a Beta mask policy with clipped trust-region updates and multimodal rewards derived from an audio-text-vision encoder. A progressive alignment scheme fine-tunes this encoder for better cross-modal discriminability.

Result: The method achieves consistent improvements in text-, audio-, and image-queried sound separation across benchmarks. It enhances both signal metrics and semantic quality.

Conclusion: MARS-Sep offers an innovative RL-based framework that successfully addresses semantic challenges in sound separation, pushing the field forward in multimodal and semantically aligned tasks.

Abstract: Universal sound separation faces a fundamental misalignment: models optimized
for low-level signal metrics often produce semantically contaminated outputs,
failing to suppress perceptually salient interference from acoustically similar
sources. To bridge this gap, we introduce MARS-Sep, a reinforcement learning
framework that reformulates separation as decision making. Instead of simply
regressing ground-truth masks, MARS-Sep learns a factorized Beta mask policy
that is optimized by a clipped trust-region surrogate with entropy
regularization and group-relative advantage normalization. Concretely, we
sample masks from a frozen old policy, reconstruct waveforms, and update the
current policy using clipped importance ratios-yielding substantially more
stable and sample-efficient learning. Multimodal rewards, derived from an
audio-text-vision encoder, directly incentivize semantic consistency with query
prompts. We further propose a progressive alignment scheme to fine-tune this
encoder, boosting its cross-modal discriminability and improving reward
faithfulness. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate
consistent gains in Text-, Audio-, and Image-Queried separation, with notable
improvements in signal metrics and semantic quality. Our code is available at

TL;DR: This paper proposes a data augmentation framework for speech emotion recognition (SER) using cross-modal information transfer and mutual information regularization. The framework was tested on benchmark datasets and improved emotion classification performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SER research struggles with the need for large, high-quality labelled training datasets. Data augmentation methods, particularly using generative models, have shown promise in addressing this challenge.

Method: The proposed framework incorporates cross-modal information transfer and mutual information regularization to enhance data augmentation. Mutual information is used to measure quality and ensure dependency between modalities.

Result: The framework was tested on three benchmarks: IEMOCAP, MSP-IMPROV, and MSP-Podcast. It outperformed existing methods in emotion classification and could generate new inputs without cross-modal assistance.

Conclusion: The framework offers an effective solution for improving SER by leveraging multimodal inputs and mutual information regularization, advancing both data quality and classification accuracy.

Abstract: Although speech emotion recognition (SER) research has been advanced, thanks
to deep learning methods, it still suffers from obtaining inputs from large
quality-labelled training data. Data augmentation methods have been attempted
to mitigate this issue, generative models have shown success among them
recently. We propose a data augmentation framework that is aided by cross-modal
information transfer and mutual information regularization. Mutual information
based metric can serve as an indicator for the quality. Furthermore, we expand
this data augmentation scope to multimodal inputs, thanks to mutual information
ensureing dependency between modalities. Our framework was tested on three
benchmark datasets: IEMOCAP, MSP-IMPROV and MSP-Podcast. The implementation was
designed to generate input features that are fed into last layer for emotion
classification. Our framework improved the performance of emotion prediction
against existing works. Also, we discovered that our framework is able to
generate new inputs without any cross-modal information.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper proposes a machine learning method for transcribing MIDI-based musical parts into guitar tablature (string-fret combinations). The methodology examines aspects like parsimonious motion and playlist feasibility for standard 6-string guitar tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of determining optimal string-fret combinations for MIDI-based music transcription into guitar tablature, ensuring both playability and legible motion between notes.

Method: A machine learning-based approach with an assumption about finger stretch limits and analysis restricted to standard 6-string guitar tuning. Artificial data augmentation is used to train and enhance performance.

Result: Training on augmented datasets improves transcription accuracy, even for simpler cases, and reveals capabilities and limitations of the system.

Conclusion: Augmenting data enhances transcription effectiveness, but the study identifies weaknesses and opportunities for future improvements.

Abstract: Guitar tablature transcription consists in deducing the string and the fret
number on which each note should be played to reproduce the actual musical
part. This assignment should lead to playable string-fret combinations
throughout the entire track and, in general, preserve parsimonious motion
between successive combinations. Throughout the history of guitar playing,
specific chord fingerings have been developed across different musical styles
that facilitate common idiomatic voicing combinations and motion between them.
This paper presents a method for assigning guitar tablature notation to a given
MIDI-based musical part (possibly consisting of multiple polyphonic tracks),
i.e. no information about guitar-idiomatic expressional characteristics is
involved (e.g. bending etc.) The current strategy is based on machine learning
and requires a basic assumption about how much fingers can stretch on a
fretboard; only standard 6-string guitar tuning is examined. The proposed
method also examines the transcription of music pieces that was not meant to be
played or could not possibly be played by a guitar (e.g. potentially a
symphonic orchestra part), employing a rudimentary method for augmenting
musical information and training/testing the system with artificial data. The
results present interesting aspects about what the system can achieve when
trained on the initial and augmented dataset, showing that the training with
augmented data improves the performance even in simple, e.g. monophonic, cases.
Results also indicate weaknesses and lead to useful conclusions about possible
improvements.

Motivation: Existing AI models for music lack harmonic-melodic cohesion and are 'black-box,' making them musically uninterpretable.

Method: ProGress utilizes adaptations of the DiGress deep model, employs a Schenkerian analysis-inspired phrase fusion methodology, and includes user control features for generation.

Result: Human experiments indicate that ProGress outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in music generation quality.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) for music generation is undergoing rapid
developments, with recent symbolic models leveraging sophisticated deep
learning and diffusion model algorithms. One drawback with existing models is
that they lack structural cohesion, particularly on harmonic-melodic structure.
Furthermore, such existing models are largely "black-box" in nature and are not
musically interpretable. This paper addresses these limitations via a novel
generative music framework that incorporates concepts of Schenkerian analysis
(SchA) in concert with a diffusion modeling framework. This framework, which we
call ProGress (Prolongation-enhanced DiGress), adapts state-of-the-art deep
models for discrete diffusion (in particular, the DiGress model of Vignac et
al., 2023) for interpretable and structured music generation. Concretely, our
contributions include 1) novel adaptations of the DiGress model for music
generation, 2) a novel SchA-inspired phrase fusion methodology, and 3) a
framework allowing users to control various aspects of the generation process
to create coherent musical compositions. Results from human experiments suggest
superior performance to existing state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper presents LSZone, a lightweight architecture for real-time in-car multi-zone speech separation, aiming to reduce computational costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient and real-time system for in-car multi-zone speech separation that reduces computational cost, improving usability in vehicles.

Method: The paper introduces LSZone, incorporating a spatial information extraction-compression (SpaIEC) module and a lightweight Conv-GRU crossband-narrowband processing (CNP) module.

Result: LSZone achieves impressive performance in complex noise and multi-speaker environments with only 0.56G MACs complexity and a real-time factor of 0.37.

Conclusion: LSZone demonstrates its capability for real-time applications, offering a significant reduction in computational burden without compromising performance, making it suitable for vehicular systems.

Abstract: In-car multi-zone speech separation, which captures voices from different
speech zones, plays a crucial role in human-vehicle interaction. Although
previous SpatialNet has achieved notable results, its high computational cost
still hinders real-time applications in vehicles. To this end, this paper
proposes LSZone, a lightweight spatial information modeling architecture for
real-time in-car multi-zone speech separation. We design a spatial information
extraction-compression (SpaIEC) module that combines Mel spectrogram and
Interaural Phase Difference (IPD) to reduce computational burden while
maintaining performance. Additionally, to efficiently model spatial
information, we introduce an extremely lightweight Conv-GRU
crossband-narrowband processing (CNP) module. Experimental results demonstrate
that LSZone, with a complexity of 0.56G MACs and a real-time factor (RTF) of
0.37, delivers impressive performance in complex noise and multi-speaker
scenarios.

*Ummy Maria Muna,Md Mehedi Hasan Shawon,Md Jobayer,Sumaiya Akter,Md Rakibul Hasan,Md. Golam Rabiul Alam*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces SS-DPPN, a self-supervised model for cardiac audio analysis using a dual-path approach with waveforms and spectrograms, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for an efficient system to analyze phonocardiograms due to the limited availability of expert-annotated data for cardiovascular disease diagnosis.

Method: The authors propose a self-supervised framework with a dual-path contrastive learning architecture and hybrid loss, using Prototypical Network-based metric learning for downstream classification tasks.

Result: SS-DPPN achieves top performance on four benchmarks, requires less labeled data, and generalizes across other tasks like lung sound classification and heart rate estimation.

Conclusion: The model serves as a robust and scalable foundation system for analyzing physiological signals and proves its effectiveness through experiments and validations.

Abstract: The automated analysis of phonocardiograms is vital for the early diagnosis
of cardiovascular disease, yet supervised deep learning is often constrained by
the scarcity of expert-annotated data. In this paper, we propose the
Self-Supervised Dual-Path Prototypical Network (SS-DPPN), a foundation model
for cardiac audio representation and classification from unlabeled data. The
framework introduces a dual-path contrastive learning based architecture that
simultaneously processes 1D waveforms and 2D spectrograms using a novel hybrid
loss. For the downstream task, a metric-learning approach using a Prototypical
Network was used that enhances sensitivity and produces well-calibrated and
trustworthy predictions. SS-DPPN achieves state-of-the-art performance on four
cardiac audio benchmarks. The framework demonstrates exceptional data
efficiency with a fully supervised model on three-fold reduction in labeled
data. Finally, the learned representations generalize successfully across lung
sound classification and heart rate estimation. Our experiments and findings
validate SS-DPPN as a robust, reliable, and scalable foundation model for
physiological signals.

### [895] [Proficiency-Aware Adaptation and Data Augmentation for Robust L2 ASR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10738)
*Ling Sun,Charlotte Zhu,Shuju Shi*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper addresses bias and underperformance of ASR systems for atypical speakers like L2 learners. Two strategies, proficiency-aware multitask learning and targeted augmentation, improve fairness and reduce errors in ASR for such users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose ASR systems typically perform poorly for non-native speakers, reinforcing biases and limiting the potential for their broader use in education and accessibility contexts.

Method: The authors utilized the CEFR-graded Speak and Improve corpus and proposed two methods: (i) proficiency-aware multitask learning, which integrates ASR optimization with proficiency classification, and (ii) targeted augmentation, introducing spectrogram masking to balance low-proficiency speech.

Result: The proposed approaches achieved a relative WER reduction of 29.4% and a relative reduction in insertion/deletion errors by up to 58.6%. Additionally, the strategies consistently reduced performance disparity across speaker proficiency levels.

Conclusion: The strategies enhance ASR fairness for non-native speakers, addressing real-world speaker imbalances and improving equity for L2 learners in speech recognition.

Abstract: General-purpose ASR underperforms for atypical speakers, such as L2 learners,
reinforcing bias and limiting use in education and accessibility. Using the
CEFR-graded Speak and Improve corpus, we show that naive fine-tuning of Whisper
reduces average WER but simultaneously widens disparities and
disproportionately harms lower-level learners. To address this, we propose two
strategies: (i) proficiency-aware multitask learning, jointly optimizing ASR
with proficiency classification, and (ii) targeted augmentation, applying
spectrogram masking to low-proficiency speech to counter imbalance. These
approaches reduce WER by up to 29.4 percent (relative) and insertion/deletion
errors by as much as 58.6 percent (relative). Crucially, despite the severe
imbalance of the dataset reflecting real-world distributions, both strategies
consistently narrow proficiency gaps, advancing equitable ASR for L2 learners.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: ParsVoice is the largest high-quality Persian speech corpus designed for text-to-speech (TTS) applications, addressing the underrepresentation of Persian in speech technologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the lack of high-quality Persian speech corpora, which hinders the development of Persian language TTS technologies.

Method: Developed an automated pipeline to process 2,000 audiobooks into a TTS-ready dataset, using techniques like BERT-based sentence detection and binary search for audio alignment.

Result: Produced a 3,526-hour clean speech dataset, filtered into a high-quality subset of 1,804 hours, featuring over 470 speakers.

Conclusion: ParsVoice fills a critical gap in Persian speech technology resources and serves as an example for advancing similar efforts in other low-resource languages.

Abstract: Persian Language, despite being spoken by over 100 million people worldwide,
remains severely underrepresented in high-quality speech corpora, particularly
for text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis applications. Existing Persian speech
datasets are typically smaller than their English counterparts, which creates a
key limitation for developing Persian speech technologies. We address this gap
by introducing ParsVoice, the largest Persian speech corpus designed
specifically for TTS applications. We created an automated pipeline that
transforms raw audiobook content into TTS-ready data, incorporating components
such as a BERT-based sentence completion detector, a binary search boundary
optimization method for precise audio-text alignment, and multi-dimensional
quality assessment frameworks tailored to Persian. The pipeline processes 2,000
audiobooks, yielding 3,526 hours of clean speech, which was further filtered
into a 1,804-hour high-quality subset suitable for TTS, featuring more than 470
speakers. ParsVoice is the largest high-quality Persian speech dataset,
offering speaker diversity and audio quality comparable to major English
corpora. The complete dataset has been made publicly available to accelerate
the development of Persian speech technologies and to serve as a template for
other low-resource languages. The ParsVoice dataset is publicly available at
ParsVoice (https://huggingface.co/datasets/MohammadJRanjbar/ParsVoice).

### [897] [Unify Variables in Neural Scaling Laws for General Audio Representations via Embedding Effective Rank](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10948)
*Xuyao Deng,Yanjie Sun,Yong Dou,Kele Xu*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper explores scaling laws in general audio representation learning, utilizing a metric called embedding effective rank (RankMe) to measure and predict representation quality across various factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling laws have provided significant insights in computer vision and NLP but remain underexplored in audio representation learning, partly due to the complexity of influencing variables.

Method: The study systematically employs RankMe, an information-theoretic metric, to analyze scaling behaviors of audio embeddings across hyper-parameter spaces such as model size, data volume, and architecture.

Result: A consistent power-law relationship was found between RankMe and audio representation quality, validating RankMe as a proxy for performance evaluation in audio embedding models.

Conclusion: RankMe offers a robust, label-free framework for understanding scaling laws in audio representation, enabling more informed strategies for designing audio foundation models.

Abstract: Scaling laws have profoundly shaped our understanding of model performance in
computer vision and natural language processing, yet their application to
general audio representation learning remains underexplored. A key challenge
lies in the multifactorial nature of general audio
representation-representation quality is jointly influenced by variables such
as audio length, embedding dimensionality, model depth, model architecture,
data volume, etc., many of which are difficult to isolate or express
analytically. In this work, we present a systematic study of scaling laws for
general audio representations by utilizing embedding effective rank (RankMe) as
a unifying metric that encapsulates the impact of diverse variables on
representation quality. RankMe enables a label-free, information-theoretic
quantification of audio embeddings, allowing us to examine scaling behaviors
across a wide hyper-parameter space, including model size, training data
volume, computational budget, architectural configurations, etc. Our empirical
findings reveal a consistent power-law relationship between RankMe and
representation quality, suggesting that embedding effective rank serves as a
reliable proxy for assessing and predicting model performance in audio
representation learning. This work not only validates the applicability of
classical scaling principles to the general audio domain but also offers a
theoretically grounded and empirically robust framework for guiding future
model scaling strategies in audio foundation models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for automatic sample identification in music using a self-supervised approach and contrastive learning objective, showcasing significant improvement over previous techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sampling in modern music production is common, and there's a need for automatic identification of sampled content and its origin in a scalable and robust manner.

Method: The authors used a self-supervised learning approach, leveraging multi-track datasets to create positive pairs of artificial mixes, combined with a novel contrastive learning objective.

Result: The proposed method outperformed prior state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrated robustness across genres, and scaled effectively with noise in the reference database.

Conclusion: High-quality separated stems are essential for the success of the proposed method, which provides a significant advancement in sample identification tasks.

Abstract: Sampling, the technique of reusing pieces of existing audio tracks to create
new music content, is a very common practice in modern music production. In
this paper, we tackle the challenging task of automatic sample identification,
that is, detecting such sampled content and retrieving the material from which
it originates. To do so, we adopt a self-supervised learning approach that
leverages a multi-track dataset to create positive pairs of artificial mixes,
and design a novel contrastive learning objective. We show that such method
significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art baselines, that is robust
to various genres, and that scales well when increasing the number of noise
songs in the reference database. In addition, we extensively analyze the
contribution of the different components of our training pipeline and
highlight, in particular, the need for high-quality separated stems for this
task.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Audio-Maestro introduces a framework for audio-language models to autonomously use external tools, improving accuracy and interpretability in audio reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most audio-language models focus on end-to-end reasoning, limiting their accuracy and interpretability in tasks requiring structured knowledge or specialized signal analysis.

Method: Audio-Maestro equips models with the ability to call external tools and integrate their outputs, enhancing analyses and reasoning capabilities beyond end-to-end inference.

Result: Audio-Maestro significantly improves model performance in audio reasoning, raising accuracy from 67.4% to 72.1% for Gemini-2.5-flash, 58.3% to 62.8% for DeSTA-2.5, and 60.8% to 63.9% for GPT-4o on MMAU-Test.

Conclusion: The framework is a novel advancement in audio reasoning, enhancing interpretability and structured analysis, making it the first to use external tool outputs in audio-language reasoning models.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown strong
capabilities in audio understanding. However, most systems rely solely on
end-to-end reasoning, limiting interpretability and accuracy for tasks that
require structured knowledge or specialized signal analysis. In this work, we
present Audio-Maestro -- a tool-augmented audio reasoning framework that
enables audio-language models to autonomously call external tools and integrate
their timestamped outputs into the reasoning process. This design allows the
model to analyze, transform, and interpret audio signals through specialized
tools rather than relying solely on end-to-end inference. Experiments show that
Audio-Maestro consistently improves general audio reasoning performance:
Gemini-2.5-flash's average accuracy on MMAU-Test rises from 67.4% to 72.1%,
DeSTA-2.5 from 58.3% to 62.8%, and GPT-4o from 60.8% to 63.9%. To our
knowledge, Audio-Maestro is the first framework to integrate structured tool
output into the large audio language model reasoning process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to ensure trustworthy certification of unsolvability in temporal planning problems, addressing the need for reliable and formally verified tools in this domain.

Method: The planning problem is encoded as a network of timed automata and processed through a model checker. The output is then independently certified using a formally verified certificate checker implemented in Isabelle/HOL.

Result: The approach integrates formal verification of encoding and certification mechanisms to prioritize trustworthiness in identifying unsolvable planning scenarios.

Conclusion: The method effectively combines encoding, model checking, and formal verification using theorem provers to provide reliable certifications for temporal planning problems.

Abstract: We present an approach to unsolvability certification of temporal planning.
Our approach is based on encoding the planning problem into a network of timed
automata, and then using an efficient model checker on the network followed by
a certificate checker to certify the output of the model checker. Our approach
prioritises trustworthiness of the certification: we formally verify our
implementation of the encoding to timed automata using the theorem prover
Isabelle/HOL and we use an existing certificate checker (also formally verified
in Isabelle/HOL) to certify the model checking result.

Abstract: In these lecture notes, we first recall the connection between graph neural
networks, Weisfeiler-Lehman tests and logics such as first-order logic and
graded modal logic. We then present a modal logic in which counting modalities
appear in linear inequalities in order to solve verification tasks on graph
neural networks. We describe an algorithm for the satisfiability problem of
that logic. It is inspired from the tableau method of vanilla modal logic,
extended with reasoning in quantifier-free fragment Boolean algebra with
Presburger arithmetic.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a protocol that minimizes worst-case packet latency in on-chip networks by enabling header-only deflection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high worst-case packet latency and traffic in deflection-based on-chip interconnect networks.

*Ziyi Liu,Qingyue Long,Zhiwen Xue,Huandong Wang,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: This paper proposes MSTDiff, a Multi-Scale Diffusion Transformer, for joint simulation of user mobility and mobile traffic, showing improved statistical accuracy over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the scarcity of large-scale, fine-grained mobility and traffic data due to privacy concerns and collection costs, and explore their interconnected dynamics for improved simulation.

Method: MSTDiff employs multi-resolution traffic decomposition via discrete wavelet transforms, a hybrid denoising network for traffic and trajectory data. It integrates urban knowledge graph embeddings and uses multi-scale Transformer models with cross-attention for comprehensive data simulation.

Result: MSTDiff improves traffic generation by reducing JSD by 17.38% and trajectory generation by 39.53%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in accuracy.

Conclusion: MSTDiff effectively simulates interconnected mobility and traffic patterns, making it highly useful for applications like urban planning and network optimization.

Abstract: User mobility trajectory and mobile traffic data are essential for a wide
spectrum of applications including urban planning, network optimization, and
emergency management. However, large-scale and fine-grained mobility data
remains difficult to obtain due to privacy concerns and collection costs,
making it essential to simulate realistic mobility and traffic patterns. User
trajectories and mobile traffic are fundamentally coupled, reflecting both
physical mobility and cyber behavior in urban environments. Despite this strong
interdependence, existing studies often model them separately, limiting the
ability to capture cross-modal dynamics. Therefore, a unified framework is
crucial. In this paper, we propose MSTDiff, a Multi-Scale Diffusion Transformer
for joint simulation of mobile traffic and user trajectories. First, MSTDiff
applies discrete wavelet transforms for multi-resolution traffic decomposition.
Second, it uses a hybrid denoising network to process continuous traffic
volumes and discrete location sequences. A transition mechanism based on urban
knowledge graph embedding similarity is designed to guide semantically informed
trajectory generation. Finally, a multi-scale Transformer with cross-attention
captures dependencies between trajectories and traffic. Experiments show that
MSTDiff surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in traffic and trajectory
generation tasks, reducing Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) across key
statistical metrics by up to 17.38% for traffic generation, and by an average
of 39.53% for trajectory generation. The source code is available at:

*Xiucheng Wang,Zien Wang,Nan Cheng,Wenchao Xu,Wei Quan,Xuemin Shen*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a graph neural network (GNN)-based multicast routing framework for 6G networks that balances cost-efficiency and user-specific quality-of-service demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of delivering QoS-differentiated services in 6G networks using traditional and neural approaches, which suffer from computational inefficiencies and lack scalability respectively.

Method: The framework formulates multicast routing as a constrained minimum-flow optimization, using a graph attention network (GAT) for node embeddings and an LSTM module for sequential routing decisions, coupled with reinforcement learning.

Result: The proposed method approximates optimal solutions while significantly reducing computational complexity and generalizes well to dynamic and large-scale networks.

Conclusion: This GNN-based framework is a promising solution for real-time multimedia delivery in 6G networks and achieves scalable, efficient, and QoS-driven routing.

Abstract: The increase of bandwidth-intensive applications in sixth-generation (6G)
wireless networks, such as real-time volumetric streaming and multi-sensory
extended reality, demands intelligent multicast routing solutions capable of
delivering differentiated quality-of-service (QoS) at scale. Traditional
shortest-path and multicast routing algorithms are either computationally
prohibitive or structurally rigid, and they often fail to support heterogeneous
user demands, leading to suboptimal resource utilization. Neural network-based
approaches, while offering improved inference speed, typically lack topological
generalization and scalability. To address these limitations, this paper
presents a graph neural network (GNN)-based multicast routing framework that
jointly minimizes total transmission cost and supports user-specific video
quality requirements. The routing problem is formulated as a constrained
minimum-flow optimization task, and a reinforcement learning algorithm is
developed to sequentially construct efficient multicast trees by reusing paths
and adapting to network dynamics. A graph attention network (GAT) is employed
as the encoder to extract context-aware node embeddings, while a long
short-term memory (LSTM) module models the sequential dependencies in routing
decisions. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed method closely
approximates optimal dynamic programming-based solutions while significantly
reducing computational complexity. The results also confirm strong
generalization to large-scale and dynamic network topologies, highlighting the
method's potential for real-time deployment in 6G multimedia delivery
scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/UNIC-Lab/GNN-Routing.

### [907] [Network-Optimised Spiking Neural Network (NOS) Scheduling for 6G O-RAN: Spectral Margin and Delay-Tail Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11291)
*Muhammad Bilal,Xiaolong Xu*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a delay-aware Network-Optimised Spiking (NOS) scheduler for 6G radio access, offering improved utilization and delay performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to design a scheduling approach for 6G radio access networks that accounts for delay, improves utilization, and ensures network feasibility under resource constraints.

Method: The proposed method involves coupling a two-state kernel (excitability and recovery states) to a proportional-fair grant head, incorporating neighbor pressure through delayed spikes in interference graphs, and analyzing performance using delay-dependent thresholds and spectral margins.

Result: The NOS scheduler demonstrates superior performance in terms of utilization and 99.9th-percentile delay compared to PF and delayed backpressure schedulers, especially under varied delay conditions (5–20ms).

Conclusion: The NOS approach is effective in maintaining clique-feasibility, achieving better delay and utilization results, and offering robust spectral margin performance for 6G systems.

Abstract: This work presents a Network-Optimised Spiking (NOS) delay-aware scheduler
for 6G radio access. The scheme couples a bounded two-state kernel to a
clique-feasible proportional-fair (PF) grant head: the excitability state acts
as a finite-buffer proxy, the recovery state suppresses repeated grants, and
neighbour pressure is injected along the interference graph via delayed spikes.
A small-signal analysis yields a delay-dependent threshold $k_\star(\Delta)$
and a spectral margin $\delta = k_\star(\Delta) - gH\rho(W)$ that compress
topology, controller gain, and delay into a single design parameter. Under
light assumptions on arrivals, we prove geometric ergodicity for $\delta>0$ and
derive sub-Gaussian backlog and delay tail bounds with exponents proportional
to $\delta$. A numerical study, aligned with the analysis and a DU compute
budget, compares NOS with PF and delayed backpressure (BP) across interference
topologies over a $5$--$20$\,ms delay sweep. With a single gain fixed at the
worst spectral radius, NOS sustains higher utilisation and a smaller
99.9th-percentile delay while remaining clique-feasible on integer PRBs.

Motivation: Understanding the characteristics of network traffic generated by GenAI chatbots, which is largely unexplored, and its impact on mobile networks.

Method: The study uses a dual dataset approach (generic and controlled) and applies traffic characterization at multiple levels using Multimodal Markov Chains, complemented by protocol and occlusion analyses.

Result: Distinct traffic patterns are observed for each app, including protocol adoption, traffic volume, and uplink/downlink profiles. Payload-based occlusion analysis shows significant contributions to classification accuracy by Server Name Indication (SNI).

Conclusion: GenAI chatbots have unique network traffic characteristics compared to conventional messaging apps, with implications for network monitoring, management, and optimization. Datasets are publicly released for further research.

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) chatbots are now pervasive in digital ecosystems, yet
their network traffic remains largely underexplored. This study presents an
in-depth investigation of traffic generated by three leading chatbots (ChatGPT,
Copilot, and Gemini) when accessed via Android mobile apps for both text and
image generation. Using a dedicated capture architecture, we collect and label
two complementary workloads: a 60-hour generic dataset with unconstrained
prompts, and a controlled dataset built from identical prompts across GenAI
apps and replicated via conventional messaging apps to enable one-to-one
comparisons. This dual design allows us to address practical research questions
on the distinctiveness of GenAI traffic, its differences from widely deployed
traffic categories, and its novel implications for network usage. To this end,
we provide fine-grained traffic characterization at trace, flow, and protocol
levels, and model packet-sequence dynamics with Multimodal Markov Chains. Our
analyses reveal app- and content-specific traffic patterns, particularly in
volume, uplink/downlink profiles, and protocol adoption. We highlight the
predominance of TLS, with Gemini extensively leveraging QUIC, ChatGPT
exclusively using TLS 1.3, and app- and content-specific Server Name Indication
(SNI) values. A payload-based occlusion analysis quantifies SNI's contribution
to classification: masking it reduces F1-score by up to 20 percentage points in
GenAI app traffic classification. Finally, compared with conventional messaging
apps when carrying the same content, GenAI chatbots exhibit unique traffic
characteristics, highlighting new stress factors for mobile networks, such as
sustained upstream activity, with direct implications for network monitoring
and management. We publicly release the datasets to support reproducibility and
foster extensions to other use cases.

### [909] [A Flexible Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for Dynamic Routing and Scheduling of Latency-Critical Services](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11535)
*Vincenzo Norman Vitale,Antonia Maria Tulino,Andreas F. Molisch,Jaime Llorca*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MA-DRL) framework to ensure timely packet delivery in dynamic networks with strict end-to-end latency constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitations of average delay-focused network control solutions by delivering packets reliably within specified deadlines in latency-critical applications such as automation and self-driving vehicles.

Method: A novel MA-DRL framework is designed, employing centralized routing and distributed scheduling architecture. It uses the MADDPG technique to dynamically determine paths and manage transmissions, integrating both data-driven DRL agents and rule-based policies.

Result: The framework outperforms traditional optimization methods and demonstrates superior packet delivery within deadlines. It also provides insights into balancing rule-based policies with data-driven DRL agents for optimal network control.

Conclusion: The method ensures efficient, high-performance control of dynamic networks, demonstrating its potential for handling strict latency requirements in various applications.

Abstract: Timely delivery of delay-sensitive information over dynamic, heterogeneous
networks is increasingly essential for a range of interactive applications,
such as industrial automation, self-driving vehicles, and augmented reality.
However, most existing network control solutions target only average delay
performance, falling short of providing strict End-to-End (E2E) peak latency
guarantees. This paper addresses the challenge of reliably delivering packets
within application-imposed deadlines by leveraging recent advancements in
Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MA-DRL). After introducing the
Delay-Constrained Maximum-Throughput (DCMT) dynamic network control problem,
and highlighting the limitations of current solutions, we present a novel
MA-DRL network control framework that leverages a centralized routing and
distributed scheduling architecture. The proposed framework leverages critical
networking domain knowledge for the design of effective MA-DRL strategies based
on the Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) technique, where
centralized routing and distributed scheduling agents dynamically assign paths
and schedule packet transmissions according to packet lifetimes, thereby
maximizing on-time packet delivery. The generality of the proposed framework
allows integrating both data-driven \blue{Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)}
agents and traditional rule-based policies in order to strike the right balance
between performance and learning complexity. Our results confirm the
superiority of the proposed framework with respect to traditional stochastic
optimization-based approaches and provide key insights into the role and
interplay between data-driven DRL agents and new rule-based policies for both
efficient and high-performance control of latency-critical services.

### [910] [A Constrained Multi-Fidelity Bayesian Optimization Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10984)
*Jingyi Wang,Nai-Yuan Chiang,Tucker Hartland,J. Luc Peterson,Jerome Solberg,Cosmin G. Petra*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel method for constrained multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization (CMFBO) with new acquisition functions for efficient optimization, even without feasible initial samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high cost of high-fidelity simulations and experiments in constrained optimization problems justifies the need for developing more efficient MFBO methods that can effectively handle constraints and define feasible regions.

Method: This work proposes CMFBO with innovative acquisition functions that are analytically closed-form, easy to implement, and functional without requiring feasible initial samples.

Result: The approach is tested on synthetic problems and applied to real-world cases like inertial confinement fusion (ICF) design and high-current joint design, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed CMFBO approach provides a robust and computationally efficient framework for constrained optimization, particularly valuable for engineering applications involving expensive simulations.

Abstract: Recently, multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization (MFBO) has been successfully
applied to many engineering design optimization problems, where the cost of
high-fidelity simulations and experiments can be prohibitive. However,
challenges remain for constrained optimization problems using the MFBO
framework, particularly in efficiently identifying the feasible region defined
by the constraints. In this paper, we propose a constrained multi-fidelity
Bayesian optimization (CMFBO) method with novel acquisition functions.
Specifically, we design efficient acquisition functions that 1) have
analytically closed-form expressions; 2) are straightforward to implement; and
3) do not require feasible initial samples, an important feature often missing
in commonly used acquisition functions such as expected constrained improvement
(ECI). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms on synthetic test
problems using different combinations of acquisition functions. Then, we apply
the proposed method to a data-driven inertial confinement fusion (ICF) design
problem, and a high-current joint design problem using finite element
simulations with computational contact mechanics.

### [911] [Learning Operators through Coefficient Mappings in Fixed Basis Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10350)
*Chuqi Chen,Yang Xiang,Weihong Zhang*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper introduces FB-C2CNet, an operator learning network that works in the coefficient space of input functions, improving training efficiency and accuracy for PDE-related problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical operator learning methods rely on pointwise-to-pointwise mapping, which can be inefficient and lacks versatility in understanding operator behavior. The paper aims to explore a new coefficient-based framework for addressing these issues.

Method: The proposed FB-C2CNet projects input functions into coefficient spaces using selected basis functions and trains a neural network to map coefficients of input functions to solution coefficients. This decouples basis selection from network training.

Result: FB-C2CNet demonstrates high accuracy and computational efficiency in numerical experiments on problems like Darcy flow, Poisson equations, and elasticity in diverse domains.

Conclusion: FB-C2CNet offers a novel and efficient approach to operator learning by leveraging coefficient spaces, improving interpretability, generalization, and performance over classical methods.

Abstract: Operator learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for approximating
solution operators of partial differential equations (PDEs) and other
functional mappings. \textcolor{red}{}{Classical approaches} typically adopt a
pointwise-to-pointwise framework, where input functions are sampled at
prescribed locations and mapped directly to solution values. We propose the
Fixed-Basis Coefficient to Coefficient Operator Network (FB-C2CNet), which
learns operators in the coefficient space induced by prescribed basis
functions. In this framework, the input function is projected onto a fixed set
of basis functions (e.g., random features or finite element bases), and the
neural operator predicts the coefficients of the solution function in the same
or another basis. By decoupling basis selection from network training,
FB-C2CNet reduces training complexity, enables systematic analysis of how basis
choice affects approximation accuracy, and clarifies what properties of
coefficient spaces (such as effective rank and coefficient variations) are
critical for generalization. Numerical experiments on Darcy flow, Poisson
equations in regular, complex, and high-dimensional domains, and elasticity
problems demonstrate that FB-C2CNet achieves high accuracy and computational
efficiency, showing its strong potential for practical operator learning tasks.

### [912] [Structured Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning: a Bayesian Network Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09937)
*Shahbaz P Qadri Syed,He Bai*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper proposes a structured Bayesian network-based approach to improve the efficiency and scalability of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), introducing a partially decentralized training regime and a scalable actor-critic algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MARL algorithms fail to fully utilize inter-agent coupling information, limiting their efficiency and scalability for large-scale systems.

Method: The authors use Bayesian networks to identify the 'value dependency set' of agents for efficient local action value estimation. They propose a partially decentralized training and decentralized execution (P-DTDE) paradigm, deriving a multi-agent policy gradient theorem, and introducing a scalable actor-critic algorithm. For dense dependencies, a truncation approximation scheme is also provided.

Result: The proposed P-DTDE approach demonstrates reduced variance in policy gradient estimators compared to centralized training (CTDE). The algorithm shows improved efficiency and scalability in simulations for multi-warehouse resource allocation and multi-zone temperature control.

Conclusion: This paper establishes a new efficient MARL framework leveraging structural inter-agent dependencies, showing both theoretical and empirical advantages, particularly with large agent systems.

Abstract: The empirical success of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has
motivated the search for more efficient and scalable algorithms for large scale
multi-agent systems. However, existing state-of-the-art algorithms do not fully
exploit inter-agent coupling information to develop MARL algorithms. In this
paper, we propose a systematic approach to leverage structures in the
inter-agent couplings for efficient model-free reinforcement learning. We model
the cooperative MARL problem via a Bayesian network and characterize the subset
of agents, termed as the value dependency set, whose information is required by
each agent to estimate its local action value function exactly. Moreover, we
propose a partially decentralized training decentralized execution (P-DTDE)
paradigm based on the value dependency set. We theoretically establish that the
total variance of our P-DTDE policy gradient estimator is less than the
centralized training decentralized execution (CTDE) policy gradient estimator.
We derive a multi-agent policy gradient theorem based on the P-DTDE scheme and
develop a scalable actor-critic algorithm. We demonstrate the efficiency and
scalability of the proposed algorithm on multi-warehouse resource allocation
and multi-zone temperature control examples. For dense value dependency sets,
we propose an approximation scheme based on truncation of the Bayesian network
and empirically show that it achieves a faster convergence than the exact value
dependence set for applications with a large number of agents.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: KG-MAS introduces a Knowledge Graph-enhanced multi-agent system to address challenges in CPS, offering semantic-rich, scalable, and flexible coordination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CPS solutions in Industry 4.0 struggle with heterogeneity and complexity, relying on limited, rigid, or brittle approaches.

Method: KG-MAS uses a centralized Knowledge Graph as a shared model, allowing autonomous agents to query and update it dynamically. It employs a model-driven architecture for automatic agent generation.

Result: KG-MAS enables robust, scalable, and intelligent coordination by abstracting underlying communication protocols and centralizing semantic representations.

Conclusion: KG-MAS successfully integrates physical and digital systems by simplifying system handling and enhancing intelligent operations in heterogeneous environments.

Abstract: The seamless integration of physical and digital environments in
Cyber-Physical Systems(CPS), particularly within Industry 4.0, presents
significant challenges stemming from system heterogeneity and complexity.
Traditional approaches often rely on rigid, data-centric solutions like
co-simulation frameworks or brittle point-to-point middleware bridges, which
lack the semantic richness and flexibility required for intelligent, autonomous
coordination. This report introduces the Knowledge Graph-Enhanced Multi-Agent
Infrastructure(KG-MAS), as resolution in addressing such limitations. KG-MAS
leverages a centralized Knowledge Graph (KG) as a dynamic, shared world model,
providing a common semantic foundation for a Multi-Agent System(MAS).
Autonomous agents, representing both physical and digital components, query
this KG for decision-making and update it with real-time state information. The
infrastructure features a model-driven architecture which facilitates the
automatic generation of agents from semantic descriptions, thereby simplifying
system extension and maintenance. By abstracting away underlying communication
protocols and providing a unified, intelligent coordination mechanism, KG-MAS
offers a robust, scalable, and flexible solution for coupling heterogeneous
physical and digital robotic environments.

*Thi-Nhung Nguyen,Linhao Luo,Thuy-Trang Vu,Dinh Phung*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: This study investigates bias in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) using large language models (LLMs), highlighting challenges and potential mitigation strategies through specialized communication and robust models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bias in individual LLMs is well-studied, but bias in MAS, where multiple LLMs collaborate, is less explored. Understanding the dynamics of bias in MAS has implications for fairness and ethical AI development.

Method: Simulations were conducted where agents represent social groups, and various interaction/adversarial scenarios were tested using three bias benchmarks.

Result: Findings show MAS are less robust than single-agent systems, with bias arising early via in-group favoritism. Cooperative and debate-based communication mitigate bias amplification, and robust LLMs improve system stability.

Conclusion: MAS presents unique challenges for fairness due to bias emergence and propagation, but adapting communication strategies and using robust LLMs can enhance fairness and resilience.

Abstract: Bias in large language models (LLMs) remains a persistent challenge,
manifesting in stereotyping and unfair treatment across social groups. While
prior research has primarily focused on individual models, the rise of
multi-agent systems (MAS), where multiple LLMs collaborate and communicate,
introduces new and largely unexplored dynamics in bias emergence and
propagation. In this work, we present a comprehensive study of stereotypical
bias in MAS, examining how internal specialization, underlying LLMs and
inter-agent communication protocols influence bias robustness, propagation, and
amplification. We simulate social contexts where agents represent different
social groups and evaluate system behavior under various interaction and
adversarial scenarios. Experiments on three bias benchmarks reveal that MAS are
generally less robust than single-agent systems, with bias often emerging early
through in-group favoritism. However, cooperative and debate-based
communication can mitigate bias amplification, while more robust underlying
LLMs improve overall system stability. Our findings highlight critical factors
shaping fairness and resilience in multi-agent LLM systems.

TL;DR: MASSE is a Multi-Agent System for Structural Engineering using LLM-based agents to automate workflows, which increases efficiency and accuracy in engineering tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Structural engineering workflows have remained stagnant for decades despite their economic importance, and advancements in LLMs can address this by enabling automation and complex reasoning.

Method: A training-free multi-agent system based on LLMs is developed, integrated into real-world workflows, and validated using case studies to showcase its capabilities.

Result: The system successfully automates structural engineering tasks, reducing workload from hours to minutes, and improves reliability and accuracy.

Conclusion: MASSE demonstrates potential for immediate deployment, transforming structural engineering practices with efficiency, accuracy, and workload minimization.

Abstract: We introduce $\textbf{MASSE}$, the first Multi-Agent System for Structural
Engineering, effectively integrating large language model (LLM)-based agents
with real-world engineering workflows. Structural engineering is a fundamental
yet traditionally stagnant domain, with core workflows remaining largely
unchanged for decades despite its substantial economic impact and global market
size. Recent advancements in LLMs have significantly enhanced their ability to
perform complex reasoning, long-horizon planning, and precise tool utilization
-- capabilities well aligned with structural engineering tasks such as
interpreting design codes, executing load calculations, and verifying
structural capacities. We present a proof-of-concept showing that most
real-world structural engineering workflows can be fully automated through a
training-free LLM-based multi-agent system. MASSE enables immediate deployment
in professional environments, and our comprehensive validation on real-world
case studies demonstrates that it can reduce expert workload from approximately
two hours to mere minutes, while enhancing both reliability and accuracy in
practical engineering scenarios.

*Gabriel Smithline,Scott Nivison*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: This paper leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and game-theoretic control theory to optimize pursuer strategies in pursuit-evasion games without prior knowledge of evader locations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing pursuer positioning strategies in pursuit-evasion scenarios, particularly in the absence of known evader locations, remains a challenging objective.

Method: The approach uses multi-objective optimization to create a Graph Characteristic Space of optimal pursuer configurations. These configurations are then input into a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to predict initial 'hot start' configurations for pursuers.

Result: Empirical results show that GCN-generated configurations significantly outperform random setups in reducing evader survival rates, minimizing pursuer travel distances, and improving containment.

Conclusion: The proposed method showcases clear strategic advantages, proving its efficacy in pursuit-evasion scenarios with multiple actors.

Abstract: Effectively positioning pursuers in pursuit-evasion games without prior
knowledge of evader locations remains a significant challenge. A novel approach
that combines game-theoretic control theory with Graph Neural Networks is
introduced in this work. By conceptualizing pursuer configurations as strategic
arrangements and representing them as graphs, a Graph Characteristic Space is
constructed via multi-objective optimization to identify Pareto-optimal
configurations. A Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is trained on these
Pareto-optimal graphs to generate strategically effective initial
configurations, termed "hot starts". Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the
GCN-generated hot starts provide a significant advantage over random
configurations. In scenarios considering multiple pursuers and evaders, this
method hastens the decline in evader survival rates, reduces pursuer travel
distances, and enhances containment, showcasing clear strategic benefits.

*Xinfeng Li,Dong Huang,Jie Li,Hongyi Cai,Zhenhong Zhou,Wei Dong,XiaoFeng Wang,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: This paper introduces Agent Access Control (AAC), a new framework for governing information flow in LLM-based agents using dynamic, contextual assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The autonomy and complexity of LLM-based agents expose the limitations of traditional binary access control mechanisms.

Method: AAC framework utilizes two modules: multi-dimensional contextual evaluation and adaptive response formulation, supported by an AC reasoning engine.

Result: The paper proposes replacing static AC models with AAC, which allows nuanced, context-aware governance of information flow.

Conclusion: AAC offers a pathway to address the challenges of agent information governance, blending human-like judgment with scalable AI safety strategies.

Abstract: The autonomy and contextual complexity of LLM-based agents render traditional
access control (AC) mechanisms insufficient. Static, rule-based systems
designed for predictable environments are fundamentally ill-equipped to manage
the dynamic information flows inherent in agentic interactions. This position
paper argues for a paradigm shift from binary access control to a more
sophisticated model of information governance, positing that the core challenge
is not merely about permission, but about governing the flow of information. We
introduce Agent Access Control (AAC), a novel framework that reframes AC as a
dynamic, context-aware process of information flow governance. AAC operates on
two core modules: (1) multi-dimensional contextual evaluation, which assesses
not just identity but also relationships, scenarios, and norms; and (2)
adaptive response formulation, which moves beyond simple allow/deny decisions
to shape information through redaction, summarization, and paraphrasing. This
vision, powered by a dedicated AC reasoning engine, aims to bridge the gap
between human-like nuanced judgment and scalable Al safety, proposing a new
conceptual lens for future research in trustworthy agent design.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates Graph Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, and feedforward Neural Networks for predicting human spatial preferences in synthetic park environments, focusing on model generalizability to unseen layouts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of generalizing preference models in predicting human spatial preferences, particularly across unseen environmental configurations.

Method: Synthetic data from a controlled pocket park environment is used to compare three neural network architectures' ability to predict preferences influenced by varied physical, environmental, and social features. Generalizability is assessed using the area under the precision-recall curve.

Result: Each model’s comparative generalizability to seen and unseen layouts is analyzed, revealing insights into their effectiveness for human behavior modeling in built environments.

Conclusion: The insights provided guide the selection of neural network architectures suitable for spatial preference prediction, especially for environments not encountered during training.

Abstract: The capacity to predict human spatial preferences within built environments
is instrumental for developing Cyber-Physical-Social Infrastructure Systems
(CPSIS). A significant challenge in this domain is the generalizability of
preference models, particularly their efficacy in predicting preferences within
environmental configurations not encountered during training. While deep
learning models have shown promise in learning complex spatial and contextual
dependencies, it remains unclear which neural network architectures are most
effective at generalizing to unseen layouts. To address this, we conduct a
comparative study of Graph Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, and
standard feedforward Neural Networks using synthetic data generated from a
simplified and synthetic pocket park environment. Beginning with this
illustrative case study, allows for controlled analysis of each model's ability
to transfer learned preference patterns to unseen spatial scenarios. The models
are evaluated based on their capacity to predict preferences influenced by
heterogeneous physical, environmental, and social features. Generalizability
score is calculated using the area under the precision-recall curve for the
seen and unseen layouts. This generalizability score is appropriate for
imbalanced data, providing insights into the suitability of each neural network
architecture for preference-aware human behavior modeling in unseen built
environments.

*Yige Hong*

Main category: math.PR

TL;DR: The paper proposes improved bounds for steady-state queue lengths in multiserver queues, focusing on $GI/GI/n$ systems with a lighter-tailed case and reducing the complexity of the bounding methodology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To derive simpler and more accurate bounds for steady-state queue lengths in multiserver $GI/GI/n$ queues across all scaling regimes, addressing challenges in queueing theory and improving upon intricate prior methods.

Method: The authors propose a $1/(1−\rho)$ scaling bound limited to light-tailed distributions and leveraging stationarity, a quadratic test function, and a leave-one-out coupling technique.

Result: A tighter leading constant and a simpler proof methodology are achieved compared to existing bounds, while maintaining correct scaling for multiserver queues.

Conclusion: The work presents a more interpretable approach to steady-state queue length bounds, extending the methodology to accommodate fully heterogeneous service-time distributions.

Abstract: Bounding the queue length in a multiserver queue is a central challenge in
queueing theory. Even for the classic $GI/GI/n$ queue with homogeneous servers,
it is highly non-trivial to derive a simple and accurate bound for the
steady-state queue length that holds across all scaling regimes. A recent
breakthrough by Li and Goldberg (2025) establishes bounds that scale as
$1/(1-\rho)$ for any load $\rho < 1$ and number of servers $n$, which is the
correct scaling in many well-known scaling regimes, including classic
heavy-traffic, Halfin-Whitt and Nondegenerate-Slowdown. However, their bounds
entail large constant factors and a highly intricate proof, suggesting room for
further improvement.
  In this paper, we present a new $1/(1-\rho)$-scaling bound for the $GI/GI/n$
queue. Our bound, while restricted to the light-tailed case and the first
moment of the queue length, has a more interpretable and often tighter leading
constant. Our proof is relatively simple, utilizing a modified $GI/GI/n$ queue,
the stationarity of a quadratic test function, and a novel leave-one-out
coupling technique.
  Finally, we also extend our method to $GI/GI/n$ queues with fully
heterogeneous service-time distributions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient detection of critical health conditions in complex and high-velocity data settings remains challenging.

Result: In the evaluation with 1,000 Tuberculosis patients, the framework achieved low-latency event detection and high performance in metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.

Conclusion: The system shows promise for scalable, real-time health analytics in diverse high-volume data scenarios.

Abstract: Timely detection of critical health conditions remains a major challenge in
public health analytics, especially in Big Data environments characterized by
high volume, rapid velocity, and diverse variety of clinical data. This study
presents an ontology-enabled real-time analytics framework that integrates
Complex Event Processing (CEP) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable
intelligent health event detection and semantic reasoning over heterogeneous,
high-velocity health data streams. The architecture leverages the Basic Formal
Ontology (BFO) and Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) to model diagnostic rules
and domain knowledge. Patient data is ingested and processed using Apache Kafka
and Spark Streaming, where CEP engines detect clinically significant event
patterns. LLMs support adaptive reasoning, event interpretation, and ontology
refinement. Clinical information is semantically structured as Resource
Description Framework (RDF) triples in Graph DB, enabling SPARQL-based querying
and knowledge-driven decision support. The framework is evaluated using a
dataset of 1,000 Tuberculosis (TB) patients as a use case, demonstrating
low-latency event detection, scalable reasoning, and high model performance (in
terms of precision, recall, and F1-score). These results validate the system's

*Joydeep Chandra,Satyam Kumar Navneet,Yong Zhang*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: The Hybrid Multimodal Graph Index (HMGI) is introduced as a unified framework to enable efficient hybrid queries on multimodal data, combining capabilities of vector and graph databases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a gap between specialized vector databases, which excel at semantic similarity search, and graph databases, which are adept at relational querying. This gap limits efficient hybrid queries on multimodal data.

Method: The HMGI framework integrates graph database architecture with vector search capabilities. It employs modality-aware partitioning for embeddings, optimizes index structure, and enables adaptive, low-overhead updates for dynamic data.

Result: HMGI outperforms pure vector databases in relationship-heavy queries and achieves sub-linear query times for hybrid query tasks.

Conclusion: HMGI successfully bridges the gap between vector and graph databases, offering a powerful tool for hybrid queries on complex multimodal datasets.

Abstract: The proliferation of complex, multimodal datasets has exposed a critical gap
between the capabilities of specialized vector databases and traditional graph
databases. While vector databases excel at semantic similarity search, they
lack the capacity for deep relational querying. Conversely, graph databases
master complex traversals but are not natively optimized for high-dimensional
vector search. This paper introduces the Hybrid Multimodal Graph Index (HMGI),
a novel framework designed to bridge this gap by creating a unified system for
efficient, hybrid queries on multimodal data. HMGI leverages the native graph
database architecture and integrated vector search capabilities, exemplified by
platforms like Neo4j, to combine Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS)
with expressive graph traversal queries. Key innovations of the HMGI framework
include modality-aware partitioning of embeddings to optimize index structure
and query performance, and a system for adaptive, low-overhead index updates to
support dynamic data ingestion, drawing inspiration from the architectural
principles of systems like TigerVector. By integrating semantic similarity
search directly with relational context, HMGI aims to outperform pure vector
databases like Milvus in complex, relationship-heavy query scenarios and
achieve sub-linear query times for hybrid tasks.

*Farzaneh Zirak,Farhana Choudhury,Renata Borovica-Gajic*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: GrASP is a learning-based data prefetcher leveraging logical block addresses and query-context embedding to enhance data access performance, especially for dynamic datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address data prefetching challenges in modern dynamic and privacy-constrained datasets, where existing solutions struggle in scalability and require frequent fine-tuning.

Method: GrASP utilizes logical block address deltas, query embeddings, and multi-layer LSTMs to classify and predict delta patterns for scalable and efficient prefetching.

Result: GrASP achieves up to a 45% higher cache hit ratio, 60% lower I/O time, and 55% lower query execution latency compared to baselines. It generalizes to datasets over 250 times larger than its training data.

Conclusion: GrASP significantly improves data prefetching accuracy and scalability for analytical and transactional workloads, offering robust performance for dynamic datasets with minimal retraining requirements.

Abstract: Data prefetching--loading data into the cache before it is requested--is
essential for reducing I/O overhead and improving database performance. While
traditional prefetchers focus on sequential patterns, recent learning-based
approaches, especially those leveraging data semantics, achieve higher accuracy
for complex access patterns. However, these methods often struggle with today's
dynamic, ever-growing datasets and require frequent, timely fine-tuning.
Privacy constraints may also restrict access to complete datasets,
necessitating prefetchers that can learn effectively from samples. To address
these challenges, we present GrASP, a learning-based prefetcher designed for
both analytical and transactional workloads. GrASP enhances prefetching
accuracy and scalability by leveraging logical block address deltas and
combining query representations with result encodings. It frames prefetching as
a context-aware multi-label classification task, using multi-layer LSTMs to
predict delta patterns from embedded context. This delta modeling approach
enables GrASP to generalize predictions from small samples to larger, dynamic
datasets without requiring extensive retraining. Experiments on real-world
datasets and industrial benchmarks demonstrate that GrASP generalizes to
datasets 250 times larger than the training data, achieving up to 45% higher
hit ratios, 60% lower I/O time, and 55% lower end-to-end query execution
latency than existing baselines. On average, GrASP attains a 91.4% hit ratio, a
90.8% I/O time reduction, and a 57.1% execution latency reduction.

*Rajat Bhattacharjya,Woohyeok Park,Arnab Sarkar,Hyunwoo Oh,Mohsen Imani,Nikil Dutt*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper introduces HYPERDOA, a DoA estimation method using Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC), which is accurate and energy-efficient, especially in low SNR scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical DoA estimation methods struggle in low SNR conditions, and deep learning methods are energy-intensive and opaque, requiring an alternative approach for edge devices.

Method: HYPERDOA employs HDC with two feature extraction strategies -- Mean Spatial-Lag Autocorrelation and Spatial Smoothing -- while reframing DoA estimation as a pattern recognition problem.

Result: HYPERDOA achieves approximately 35.39% higher accuracy in low-SNR conditions compared to state-of-the-art methods and uses 93% less energy on edge devices.

Conclusion: HYPERDOA is a robust, energy-efficient solution for DoA estimation in resource-constrained, critical systems, avoiding the drawbacks of classical and deep learning methods.

Abstract: Direction of Arrival (DoA) estimation techniques face a critical trade-off,
as classical methods often lack accuracy in challenging, low signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) conditions, while modern deep learning approaches are too
energy-intensive and opaque for resource-constrained, safety-critical systems.
We introduce HYPERDOA, a novel estimator leveraging Hyperdimensional Computing
(HDC). The framework introduces two distinct feature extraction strategies --
Mean Spatial-Lag Autocorrelation and Spatial Smoothing -- for its HDC pipeline,
and then reframes DoA estimation as a pattern recognition problem. This
approach leverages HDC's inherent robustness to noise and its transparent
algebraic operations to bypass the expensive matrix decompositions and
``black-box'' nature of classical and deep learning methods, respectively. Our
evaluation demonstrates that HYPERDOA achieves ~35.39% higher accuracy than
state-of-the-art methods in low-SNR, coherent-source scenarios. Crucially, it
also consumes ~93% less energy than competing neural baselines on an embedded
NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX platform. This dual advantage in accuracy and
efficiency establishes HYPERDOA as a robust and viable solution for
mission-critical applications on edge devices.

### [924] [Performance of Machine Learning Methods for Gravity Inversion: Successes and Challenges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09632)
*Vahid Negahdari,Shirin Samadi Bahrami,Seyed Reza Moghadasi,Mohammad Reza Razvan*

Main category: physics.geo-ph

TL;DR: This paper explores machine-learning models like CNNs, VAEs, and GANs for the ill-posed problem of gravity inversion while assessing classical iterative solvers for refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gravity inversion is inherently ill-posed, with more parameters than measurements, making density reconstruction from gravitational data both non-unique and challenging.

Method: The authors use CNNs combined with novel data structures to map gravity anomalies to density fields, apply generative models (VAEs, GANs) with latent-space optimization, and evaluate iterative solvers for improving CNN outputs.

Result: CNN-based inversion demonstrated the most reliable reconstructions, outperforming previous approaches, while generative models showed promise but remained unstable, and iterative solvers offered minor improvements.

Conclusion: CNNs are the most effective for gravity inversion among the studied approaches, though issues of instability and ill-posedness persist in alternative methods.

Abstract: Gravity inversion is the problem of estimating subsurface density
distributions from observed gravitational field data. We consider the
two-dimensional (2D) case, in which recovering density models from
one-dimensional (1D) measurements leads to an underdetermined system with
substantially more model parameters than measurements, making the inversion
ill-posed and non-unique. Recent advances in machine learning have motivated
data-driven approaches for gravity inversion. We first design a convolutional
neural network (CNN) trained to directly map gravity anomalies to density
fields, where a customized data structure is introduced to enhance the
inversion performance. To further investigate generative modeling, we employ
Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs),
reformulating inversion as a latent-space optimization constrained by the
forward operator. In addition, we assess whether classical iterative solvers
such as Gradient Descent (GD), GMRES, LGMRES, and a recently proposed Improved
Conjugate Gradient (ICG) method can refine CNN-based initial guesses and
improve inversion accuracy. Our results demonstrate that CNN inversion not only
provides the most reliable reconstructions but also significantly outperforms
previously reported methods. Generative models remain promising but unstable,
and iterative solvers offer only marginal improvements, underscoring the
persistent ill-posedness of gravity inversion.

### [925] [Deep Signature and Neural RDE Methods for Path-Dependent Portfolio Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10728)
*Ali Atiah Alzahrani*

Main category: q-fin.MF

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deep BSDE and 2BSDE solver using neural rough differential equations and truncated log signatures for high-dimensional, path-dependent financial problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in solving high-dimensional, path-dependent valuation and control problems in financial models.

Method: The method employs a neural rough differential equation backbone with truncated log signatures, sequence-to-path learning, and a CVaR tilted objective. It also includes an optional second-order head for risk-sensitive control.

Result: The proposed approach improves accuracy, tail risk fidelity, and training stability in tasks like option pricing and portfolio control. It outperforms baselines at 200 dimensions, achieving better CVaR and lower RMSE values.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates that combining stochastic analysis with deep learning enables scalable solutions for complex financial models while offering better performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: We present a deep BSDE and 2BSDE solver that combines truncated log
signatures with a neural rough differential equation backbone for high
dimensional, path dependent valuation and control. The design aligns stochastic
analysis with sequence to path learning, using a CVaR tilted objective to
emphasize left tail risk and an optional second order head for risk sensitive
control. Under equal compute and parameter budgets, the method improves
accuracy, tail fidelity, and training stability across Asian and barrier option
pricing and portfolio control tasks. At 200 dimensions, it achieves CVaR(0.99)
= 9.8 percent compared to 12.0-13.1 percent for strong baselines, while
attaining low HJB residuals and small RMSE for Z and Gamma. Ablations confirm
complementary gains from the sequence to path representation and the second
order structure. Overall, the results show that combining stochastic analysis
with modern deep learning expands the class of solvable path dependent
financial models at scale.

*Daniel Seifert,Onur Günlü,Rafael F. Schaefer*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper explores the application of the forward-forward learning algorithm to design autoencoders for communication systems, highlighting its efficiency in scenarios where backpropagation training is less suitable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of the backpropagation algorithm in neural network training, particularly in scenarios requiring energy efficiency and non-differentiable channels.

Method: Deep learning-based autoencoders were designed using the forward-forward algorithm, and their performance was numerically evaluated for specific communication scenarios.

Result: FF-trained systems demonstrated competitive performance compared to BP-trained ones, with notable memory and processing time savings.

Conclusion: The forward-forward algorithm offers a viable, energy-efficient alternative for training deep learning systems in communication channels, opening new design possibilities.

Abstract: The application of deep learning to the area of communications systems has
been a growing field of interest in recent years. Forward-forward (FF) learning
is an efficient alternative to the backpropagation (BP) algorithm, which is the
typically used training procedure for neural networks. Among its several
advantages, FF learning does not require the communication channel to be
differentiable and does not rely on the global availability of partial
derivatives, allowing for an energy-efficient implementation. In this work, we
design end-to-end learned autoencoders using the FF algorithm and numerically
evaluate their performance for the additive white Gaussian noise and Rayleigh
block fading channels. We demonstrate their competitiveness with BP-trained
systems in the case of joint coding and modulation, and in a scenario where a
fixed, non-differentiable modulation stage is applied. Moreover, we provide
further insights into the design principles of the FF network, its training
convergence behavior, and significant memory and processing time savings
compared to BP-based approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of understanding the analytic structure of multi-loop Feynman integrals in a broadly interpretable manner.

Method: The authors employ a machine-learning framework focused on symbolic regression to reconstruct the symbol alphabets rather than relying on reduction methods.

Result: The framework successfully identifies the complete symbol alphabets for nontrivial examples, proving its robustness and general applicability.

Conclusion: This approach accelerates specific computations while universally uncovering analytic structures, opening new opportunities for amplitude analysis in multi-loop contexts.

Abstract: We introduce a machine-learning framework based on symbolic regression to
extract the full symbol alphabet of multi-loop Feynman integrals. By targeting
the analytic structure rather than reduction, the method is broadly applicable
and interpretable across different families of integrals. It successfully
reconstructs complete symbol alphabets in nontrivial examples, demonstrating
both robustness and generality. Beyond accelerating computations case by case,
it uncovers the analytic structure universally. This framework opens new
avenues for multi-loop amplitude analysis and provides a versatile tool for
exploring scattering amplitudes.

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: This paper forecasts macroeconomic outcomes' full distribution through high-dimensional data, out-of-sample validation, and nonlinearities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the prediction accuracy of the entire macroeconomic risk profile using a systematic and integrated approach.

Method: Employ high-dimensional data with regularization, out-of-sample validation, and analysis of the role of nonlinearities.

Result: Regularization is crucial for controlling model complexity; nonlinearities offer limited predictive improvements; out-of-sample validation prevents overfitting.

Conclusion: Their approach effectively forecasts macroeconomic risk by balancing model complexity, improving validation, and analyzing nonlinear impacts.

Abstract: We forecast the full conditional distribution of macroeconomic outcomes by
systematically integrating three key principles: using high-dimensional data
with appropriate regularization, adopting rigorous out-of-sample validation
procedures, and incorporating nonlinearities. By exploiting the rich
information embedded in a large set of macroeconomic and financial predictors,
we produce accurate predictions of the entire profile of macroeconomic risk in
real time. Our findings show that regularization via shrinkage is essential to
control model complexity, while introducing nonlinearities yields limited
improvements in predictive accuracy. Out-of-sample validation plays a critical
role in selecting model architecture and preventing overfitting.

TL;DR: Deep learning enhances astronomy by integrating domain-specific knowledge into models, enabling learning from scarce labeled data and tackling complex distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discuss how deep learning complements classical methods in astronomy, enabling advancements in data analysis for modern astronomical surveys.

Method: Examines encoding physical laws, symmetries, and domain knowledge into neural architectures, and evaluates emerging paradigms like reinforcement learning and foundation models.

Result: Deep learning proves effective in tackling scalability, non-Gaussian distributions, resolution bridging, and rare event detection, with potential applications for telescope operations and research automation.

Conclusion: These techniques expand analytical capabilities for astronomy, integrating physical principles to extract meaningful insights from diverse and complex datasets, though challenges remain in development and validation.

Abstract: Deep learning has generated diverse perspectives in astronomy, with ongoing
discussions between proponents and skeptics motivating this review. We examine
how neural networks complement classical statistics, extending our data
analytical toolkit for modern surveys. Astronomy offers unique opportunities
through encoding physical symmetries, conservation laws, and differential
equations directly into architectures, creating models that generalize beyond
training data. Yet challenges persist as unlabeled observations number in
billions while confirmed examples with known properties remain scarce and
expensive. This review demonstrates how deep learning incorporates domain
knowledge through architectural design, with built-in assumptions guiding
models toward physically meaningful solutions. We evaluate where these methods
offer genuine advances versus claims requiring careful scrutiny. - Neural
architectures overcome trade-offs between scalability, expressivity, and data
efficiency by encoding physical symmetries and conservation laws into network
structure, enabling learning from limited labeled data. - Simulation-based
inference and anomaly detection extract information from complex, non-Gaussian
distributions where analytical likelihoods fail, enabling field-level
cosmological analysis and systematic discovery of rare phenomena. - Multi-scale
neural modeling bridges resolution gaps in astronomical simulations, learning
effective subgrid physics from expensive high-fidelity runs to enhance
large-volume calculations where direct computation remains prohibitive. -
Emerging paradigms-reinforcement learning for telescope operations, foundation
models learning from minimal examples, and large language model agents for
research automation-show promise though are still developing in astronomical
applications.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper presents an optimization framework for transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) that utilizes energy-efficient asymmetric electric field pulses, achieving significant reductions in energy loss and coil heating while maintaining directional selectivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the need for more energy-efficient and directionally selective TMS pulses since existing monophasic pulses require excessive energy and previous optimizations have been constrained and non-general.

Method: An optimization framework was implemented, incorporating neuron model constraints and flexible pulse asymmetry control to generate highly energy-efficient waveforms.

Result: The optimized pulses reduced energy loss and coil heating by up to 92% and 88% respectively, compared to conventional and improved monophasic pulses. Human experiments confirmed similar motor thresholds with significantly lower energy loss, and demonstrated directional selectivity via MEP latency differences.

Conclusion: The framework yields highly energy-efficient and directionally selective pulses, suitable for rapid-rate repetitive TMS protocols, offering reduced power consumption and improved neuro-modulation precision.

Abstract: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with asymmetric electric field
pulses, such as monophasic, offers directional selectivity for neural
activation but requires excessive energy. Previous pulse shape optimisation has
been limited to symmetric pulses or heavily constrained variations of
conventional waveforms without achieving general optimality in energy
efficiency or neural selectivity. We implemented an optimisation framework that
incorporates neuron model activation constraints and flexible control of pulse
asymmetry. The optimised electric field waveforms achieved up to 92 % and 88 %
reduction in energy loss and thus coil heating respectively compared to
conventional monophasic pulses and previously improved monophasic-equivalent
pulses. In the human experiments, OUR pulses showed similar motor thresholds to
monophasic pulses in both AP and PA directions with significantly lower energy
loss, particularly in the AP direction. Moreover, there was a significant MEP
latency difference of (1.79 +/- 0.41) ms between AP and PA direction with OUR
pulses, which suggests directional selectivity. Our framework successfully
identified highly energy-efficient asymmetric pulses for
directionally-selective neural engagement. These pulses can enable selective
rapid-rate repetitive TMS protocols with reduced power consumption and coil
heating, with potential benefits for precision and potency of neuro-modulation.

TL;DR: This paper addresses real-time computation challenges in discrete-time control barrier functions (CBFs) with nonconcave safety sets by introducing a convex optimization-based method using matrix CBF techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current discrete-time CBF formulations struggle with nonconvex optimization problems, hindering real-time computation for safety-preserving control inputs.

Method: The authors propose using convex optimization paired with matrix control barrier function techniques to handle nonconvex safety sets in discrete-time systems.

Result: Numerical simulations on a bicopter system validate the proposed method's effectiveness in providing safety-preserving control inputs.

Conclusion: The paper introduces an efficient, real-time approach for ensuring safety in discrete-time systems with nonconvex safety constraints, showcasing promising results in simulations.

Abstract: Control barrier functions (CBFs) have seen widespread success in providing
forward invariance and safety guarantees for dynamical control systems. A
crucial limitation of discrete-time formulations is that CBFs that are
nonconcave in their argument require the solution of nonconvex optimization
problems to compute safety-preserving control inputs, which inhibits real-time
computation of control inputs guaranteeing forward invariance. This paper
presents a novel method for computing safety-preserving control inputs for
discrete-time systems with nonconvex safety sets, utilizing convex optimization
and the recently developed class of matrix control barrier function techniques.
The efficacy of our methods is demonstrated through numerical simulations on a
bicopter system.

TL;DR: This paper introduces an adaptive framework for synthesizing controllers in nonlinear systems to meet complex specifications while reducing control effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods for controller synthesis rely on circumvent functions, leading to abrupt modifications of spatiotemporal tubes (STTs) and increased control effort.

Method: The authors propose an adaptive framework that constructs smooth STTs around static unsafe sets, avoiding abrupt changes and guiding the system effectively. A closed-form control law is derived without approximations.

Result: The case study demonstrates that the proposed approach significantly lowers control effort while achieving time reach-avoid-stay specifications.

Conclusion: The adaptive framework provides a more efficient and smooth solution for controller synthesis in nonlinear systems, improving upon existing methods.

Abstract: In this work, we address the issue of controller synthesis for a
control-affine nonlinear system to meet prescribed time reach-avoid-stay
specifications. Our goal is to improve upon previous methods based on
spatiotemporal tubes (STTs) by eliminating the need for circumvent functions,
which often lead to abrupt tube modifications and high control effort. We
propose an adaptive framework that constructs smooth STTs around static unsafe
sets, enabling continuous avoidance while guiding the system toward the target
within the prescribed time. A closed-form, approximation-free control law is
derived to ensure the system trajectory remains within the tube and satisfies
the RAS task. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated
through a case study, showing a significant reduction in control effort
compared to prior methods.

TL;DR: This study investigates COVID-19 vaccine conspiracy theories on social media by analyzing 598 comments using BERT and Perspective API to determine sentiment and toxicity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the widespread dissemination of anti-vaccination sentiments and conspiracy theories during the COVID-19 pandemic, which have led to societal harm such as attacks on individuals and infrastructure, as well as vaccine hesitancy.

Method: The study conducts a sentiment analysis on 598 unique social media comments about COVID-19 vaccines, employing BERT and Perspective API to assess the sentiments and measure toxicity.

Result: The analysis revealed sentiments and toxicity levels in social media comments concerning COVID-19 vaccines, highlighting the presence and impact of conspiracy theories.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the significant role of social media in spreading conspiracy theories, advocating for strategies to mitigate their impact and reduce vaccine hesitancy.

Abstract: Since the beginning of the vaccination trial, social media has been flooded
with anti-vaccination comments and conspiracy beliefs. As the day passes, the
number of COVID- 19 cases increases, and online platforms and a few news
portals entertain sharing different conspiracy theories. The most popular
conspiracy belief was the link between the 5G network spreading COVID-19 and
the Chinese government spreading the virus as a bioweapon, which initially
created racial hatred. Although some disbelief has less impact on society,
others create massive destruction. For example, the 5G conspiracy led to the
burn of the 5G Tower, and belief in the Chinese bioweapon story promoted an
attack on the Asian-Americans. Another popular conspiracy belief was that Bill
Gates spread this Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) by launching a mass
vaccination program to track everyone. This Conspiracy belief creates distrust
issues among laypeople and creates vaccine hesitancy. This study aims to
discover the conspiracy theory against the vaccine on social platforms. We
performed a sentiment analysis on the 598 unique sample comments related to
COVID-19 vaccines. We used two different models, BERT and Perspective API, to
find out the sentiment and toxicity of the sentence toward the COVID-19
vaccine.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI in the public sector offers transformative potential, but adoption is uneven due to challenges in aligning responsible AI frameworks with institutional realities and foundational data governance.

Method: The study conducted a systematic review of 43 studies and gathered evaluations from 21 experts to identify and categorize the challenges into a taxonomy.

Result: The taxonomy highlights 13 key challenges, including poor data quality, inadequate infrastructure, weak governance, and sustainability concerns.

Conclusion: The taxonomy is designed as a diagnostic tool to assist policymakers in mitigating risks and establishing the conditions necessary for responsible AI implementation.

Abstract: Despite Artificial Intelligence (AI) transformative potential for public
sector services, decision-making, and administrative efficiency, adoption
remains uneven due to complex technical, organizational, and institutional
challenges. Responsible AI frameworks emphasize fairness, accountability, and
transparency, aligning with principles of trustworthy AI and fair AI, yet
remain largely aspirational, overlooking technical and institutional realities,
especially foundational data and governance. This study addresses this gap by
developing a taxonomy of data-related challenges to responsible AI adoption in
government. Based on a systematic review of 43 studies and 21 expert
evaluations, the taxonomy identifies 13 key challenges across technological,
organizational, and environmental dimensions, including poor data quality,
limited AI-ready infrastructure, weak governance, misalignment in human-AI
decision-making, economic and environmental sustainability concerns. Annotated
with institutional pressures, the taxonomy serves as a diagnostic tool to
surface 'symptoms' of high-risk AI deployment and guides policymakers in
building the institutional and data governance conditions necessary for
responsible AI adoption.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accessibility, personalization, and fairness of academic advising for college freshmen, addressing challenges like long wait times and biases.

Method: Developed a program-specific AI chatbot for engineering, analyzed responses for bias, and scored them on accuracy, relevance, personalization, and bias presence.

Result: Chatbot achieved high scores: 9.76 (accuracy), 9.56 (relevance), 9.60 (personalization), with no bias detected in sample data.

Conclusion: Carefully engineered AI chatbots can complement traditional academic advising, promoting equity in higher education, though broader testing is needed for diverse student queries.

Abstract: Selecting a college major is a difficult decision for many incoming freshmen.
Traditional academic advising is often hindered by long wait times,
intimidating environments, and limited personalization. AI Chatbots present an
opportunity to address these challenges. However, AI systems also have the
potential to generate biased responses, prejudices related to race, gender,
socioeconomic status, and disability. These biases risk turning away potential
students and undermining reliability of AI systems. This study aims to develop
a University of Maryland (UMD) A. James Clark School of Engineering
Program-specific AI chatbot. Our research team analyzed and mitigated potential
biases in the responses. Through testing the chatbot on diverse student
queries, the responses are scored on metrics of accuracy, relevance,
personalization, and bias presence. The results demonstrate that with careful
prompt engineering and bias mitigation strategies, AI chatbots can provide
high-quality, unbiased academic advising support, achieving mean scores of 9.76
for accuracy, 9.56 for relevance, and 9.60 for personalization with no
stereotypical biases found in the sample data. However, due to the small sample
size and limited timeframe, our AI model may not fully reflect the nuances of
student queries in engineering academic advising. Regardless, these findings
will inform best practices for building ethical AI systems in higher education,
offering tools to complement traditional advising and address the inequities
faced by many underrepresented and first-generation college students.

Motivation: The increasing diversity in online higher education necessitates solutions for challenges like linguistic barriers, cultural differences, and student isolation.

Method: The paper reviews existing research and proposes leveraging culturally adaptive AI agents powered by Generative AI like LLMs.

Result: The integration of AI agents with GAI can improve personalization and cultural alignment in educational systems.

Conclusion: Culturally aware AI agents using GAI have the potential to foster better engagement and effective learning outcomes in diverse educational contexts.

Abstract: As the global reach of online higher education continues to grow,
universities are increasingly accommodating students from diverse cultural
backgrounds \parencite{tereshko2024culturally}. This can present a number of
challenges including linguistic barriers \parencite{ullah2021linguistic},
cultural differences in learning style \parencite{omidvar2012cultural},
cultural sensitivity in course design \parencite{nguyen2022cultural} and
perceived isolation when students feel their perspectives or experiences are
not reflected or valued in the learning environment
\parencite{hansen2022belonging}. Ensuring active engagement and reasonable
learning outcomes in such a environments requires distance educational systems
that are not only adaptive but also culturally resonant
\parencite{dalle2024cultural}. Both embodied and virtual AI-Agents have great
potential in this regard as they can facilitate personalized learning and adapt
their interactions and content delivery to align with students' cultural
context. In addition Generative AI (GAI), such as, Large Language Models (LLMs)
can amplify the potential for these culturally aware AI agents to address
educational challenges due to their advanced capacity for understanding and
generating contextually relevant content \parencite{wang2024large}. This
chapter reviews existing research and suggests the usage of culturally aware
AI-Agents, powered by GAI, to foster engagement and improve learning outcomes
in culturally diverse online higher education environments.

TL;DR: AI-assisted evaluation was implemented in two EU government initiatives, boosting efficiency and minimizing workloads, particularly in citizen reimbursement claims where processing time reduced by over two months.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses bottlenecks in government program application evaluations caused by limited human capacity and increasing application volumes.

Method: AI-assisted evaluation systems were integrated into workflows for two government initiatives and tested for efficiency and accuracy in real-world scenarios.

Result: AI increased reviewer productivity by 20.1% and drastically cut total evaluation time, while maintaining a negligible false-positive rate.

Conclusion: AI-driven automation is effective for enhancing workflows in large-scale government evaluation processes, delivering significant time and productivity benefits.

Abstract: Every year, the European Union and its member states allocate millions of
euros to fund various development initiatives. However, the increasing number
of applications received for these programs often creates significant
bottlenecks in evaluation processes, due to limited human capacity. In this
work, we detail the real-world deployment of AI-assisted evaluation within the
pipeline of two government initiatives: (i) corporate applications aimed at
international business expansion, and (ii) citizen reimbursement claims for
investments in energy-efficient home improvements. While these two cases
involve distinct evaluation procedures, our findings confirm that AI
effectively enhanced processing efficiency and reduced workload across both
types of applications. Specifically, in the citizen reimbursement claims
initiative, our solution increased reviewer productivity by 20.1%, while
keeping a negligible false-positive rate based on our test set observations.
These improvements resulted in an overall reduction of more than 2 months in
the total evaluation time, illustrating the impact of AI-driven automation in
large-scale evaluation workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of research and knowledge regarding Computational Thinking (CT) education in higher education and explore the potential of AI in enhancing instructional strategies for CT.

Method: A systematic literature review identifying AI applications in CT education, analyzing educational elements like benefits, challenges, instructional strategies, CT components, and AI techniques/models in higher education.

Result: This study identifies AI-based initiatives in CT education, evaluates their benefits and challenges, and discusses instructional strategies and components utilized in higher education. It details AI's dual potential to significantly impact CT education both positively and negatively.

Conclusion: The study provides a valuable resource for educators and researchers, offering practical insights and broader perspectives on employing AI in CT education, emphasizing both its benefits and associated challenges such as creativity concerns.

Abstract: Computational Thinking (CT) is a key skill set for students in higher
education to thrive and adapt to an increasingly technology-driven future and
workplace. While research on CT education has gained remarkable momentum in K12
over the past decade, it has remained under-explored in higher education,
leaving higher education teachers with an insufficient overview, knowledge, and
support regarding CT education. The proliferation and adoption of artificial
intelligence (AI) by educational institutions have demonstrated promising
potential to support instructional activities across many disciplines,
including CT education. However, a comprehensive overview outlining the various
aspects of integrating AI in CT education in higher education is lacking. To
mitigate this gap, we conducted this systematic literature review study. The
focus of our study is to identify initiatives applying AI in CT education
within higher education and to explore various educational aspects of these
initiatives, including the benefits and challenges of AI in CT education,
instructional strategies employed, CT components covered, and AI techniques and
models utilized. This study provides practical and scientific contributions to
the CT education community, including an inventory of AI-based initiatives for
CT education useful to educators, an overview of various aspects of integrating
AI into CT education such as its benefits and challenges (e.g., AI potential to
reshape CT education versus its potential to diminish students creativity) and
insights into new and expanded perspectives on CT in light of AI (e.g., the
decoding approach alongside the coding approach to CT).

### [939] [Stop DDoS Attacking the Research Community with AI-Generated Survey Papers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09686)
*Jianghao Lin,Rong Shan,Jiachen Zhu,Yunjia Xi,Yong Yu,Weinan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper identifies a problem called "survey paper DDoS attack," stemming from AI-generated surveys that flood academic platforms with low-quality, redundant papers. Authors advocate for norms in AI-assisted survey writing and propose live, community-curated repositories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the problem caused by the rapid proliferation of AI-generated survey papers, which threaten the integrity and efficiency of scholarly communication.

Method: The authors utilize quantitative trend analysis, quality audits, and cultural discussions to analyze the impact and explore solutions like Dynamic Live Surveys that combine automated updates with human curation.

Result: The study highlights the severe impact AI-generated surveys have on research communities along with potential solutions to prevent the erosion of trust and efficiency.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that safeguarding the quality of survey papers is vital, urging strong norms for AI usage and the creation of community-curated infrastructures to preserve scholarly integrity.

Abstract: Survey papers are foundational to the scholarly progress of research
communities, offering structured overviews that guide both novices and experts
across disciplines. However, the recent surge of AI-generated surveys,
especially enabled by large language models (LLMs), has transformed this
traditionally labor-intensive genre into a low-effort, high-volume output.
While such automation lowers entry barriers, it also introduces a critical
threat: the phenomenon we term the "survey paper DDoS attack" to the research
community. This refers to the unchecked proliferation of superficially
comprehensive but often redundant, low-quality, or even hallucinated survey
manuscripts, which floods preprint platforms, overwhelms researchers, and
erodes trust in the scientific record. In this position paper, we argue that we
must stop uploading massive amounts of AI-generated survey papers (i.e., survey
paper DDoS attack) to the research community, by instituting strong norms for
AI-assisted review writing. We call for restoring expert oversight and
transparency in AI usage and, moreover, developing new infrastructures such as
Dynamic Live Surveys, community-maintained, version-controlled repositories
that blend automated updates with human curation. Through quantitative trend
analysis, quality audits, and cultural impact discussion, we show that
safeguarding the integrity of surveys is no longer optional but imperative to
the research community.

study conducts a comprehensive scientometric analysis of research on
data-driven pedestrian trajectory prediction and crowd simulation, mapping its
intellectual evolution and interdisciplinary structure. Using bibliometric data

twin development for smart cities. However, challenges remain in ensuring
interpretability, inclusivity, and cross-domain transferability. By connecting
methodological trajectories with urban applications, this work highlights how
data-driven approaches can enrich urban governance and pave the way for
adaptive, socially responsible mobility intelligence in future cities.

### [941] [Beyond the Crowd: LLM-Augmented Community Notes for Governing Health Misinformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11423)
*Jiaying Wu,Zihang Fu,Haonan Wang,Fanxiao Li,Min-Yen Kan*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: The paper introduces CrowdNotes+, which uses large language models (LLMs) to improve X's Community Notes feature for health misinformation by increasing speed and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current community-driven misinformation governance, such as X's Community Notes, suffers from significant delays in flagging and evaluating health-related content, with a median latency of 17.6 hours. There is a need for quicker responses during misinformation surges.

Method: CrowdNotes+ uses LLMs for augmenting Community Notes with two modes: (1) evidence-grounded note augmentation and (2) utility-guided note automation. It integrates a hierarchical three-step evaluation and introduces a benchmark called HealthNotes for testing effectiveness.

Result: Experiments on 15 LLMs highlighted a critical issue where stylistic fluency was misinterpreted as factual accuracy. The proposed hierarchical method and LLM assistance showed improvements in factual precision and the utility of evidence.

Conclusion: Combining human input with AI-driven evaluations and augmentations creates a hybrid governance model that significantly enhances the effectiveness and timeliness of crowd-sourced fact-checking systems, particularly for health misinformation.

Abstract: Community Notes, the crowd-sourced misinformation governance system on X
(formerly Twitter), enables users to flag misleading posts, attach contextual
notes, and vote on their helpfulness. However, our analysis of 30.8K
health-related notes reveals significant latency, with a median delay of 17.6
hours before the first note receives a helpfulness status. To improve
responsiveness during real-world misinformation surges, we propose CrowdNotes+,
a unified framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to augment
Community Notes for faster and more reliable health misinformation governance.
CrowdNotes+ integrates two complementary modes: (1) evidence-grounded note
augmentation and (2) utility-guided note automation, along with a hierarchical
three-step evaluation that progressively assesses relevance, correctness, and
helpfulness. We instantiate the framework through HealthNotes, a benchmark of
1.2K helpfulness-annotated health notes paired with a fine-tuned helpfulness
judge. Experiments on fifteen LLMs reveal an overlooked loophole in current
helpfulness evaluation, where stylistic fluency is mistaken for factual
accuracy, and demonstrate that our hierarchical evaluation and LLM-augmented
generation jointly enhance factual precision and evidence utility. These
results point toward a hybrid human-AI governance model that improves both the
rigor and timeliness of crowd-sourced fact-checking.

Abstract: This research develops a sentiment-driven quantitative trading system that
leverages a large language model, FinGPT, for sentiment analysis, and explores
a novel method for signal integration using a reinforcement learning algorithm,
Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3). We compare the
performance of strategies that integrate sentiment and technical signals using
both a conventional rule-based approach and a reinforcement learning framework.
The results suggest that sentiment signals generated by FinGPT offer value when
combined with traditional technical indicators, and that reinforcement learning
algorithm presents a promising approach for effectively integrating
heterogeneous signals in dynamic trading environments.

*Ana Sofia Carmo,Lourenço Abrunhosa Rodrigues,Ana Rita Peralta,Ana Fred,Carla Bentes,Hugo Plácido da Silva*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Python framework to improve seizure forecasting standardization by automating tasks such as data labeling, evaluation, and reporting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The field of seizure forecasting lacks standardization, which hinders progress and clinical application.

Method: A Python framework was developed to automate key processes in seizure forecasting, and three proof-of-concept models were implemented to demonstrate functionality.

Result: The models successfully demonstrated the framework's flexibility and highlighted the importance of careful interpretation due to subject-specific differences.

Conclusion: The framework could reduce development time and improve consistency but requires further validation to standardize seizure forecasting processes.

Abstract: The lack of standardization in seizure forecasting slows progress in the
field and limits the clinical translation of forecasting models. In this work,
we introduce a Python-based framework aimed at streamlining the development,
assessment, and documentation of individualized seizure forecasting algorithms.
  The framework automates data labeling, cross-validation splitting, forecast
post-processing, performance evaluation, and reporting. It supports various
forecasting horizons and includes a model card that documents implementation
details, training and evaluation settings, and performance metrics. Three
different models were implemented as a proof-of-concept. The models leveraged
features extracted from time series data and seizure periodicity. Model
performance was assessed using time series cross-validation and key
deterministic and probabilistic metrics.
  Implementation of the three models was successful, demonstrating the
flexibility of the framework. The results also emphasize the importance of
careful model interpretation due to variations in probability scaling,
calibration, and subject-specific differences. Although formal usability
metrics were not recorded, empirical observations suggest reduced development
time and methodological consistency, minimizing unintentional variations that
could affect the comparability of different approaches.
  As a proof-of-concept, this validation is inherently limited, relying on a
single-user experiment without statistical analyses or replication across
independent datasets. At this stage, our objective is to make the framework
publicly available to foster community engagement, facilitate experimentation,
and gather feedback. In the long term, we aim to contribute to the
establishment of a consensus on a standardized methodology for the development
and validation of seizure forecasting algorithms in people with epilepsy.

### [944] [Enhanced Sampling for Efficient Learning of Coarse-Grained Machine Learning Potentials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11148)
*Weilong Chen,Franz Görlich,Paul Fuchs,Julija Zavadlav*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: The paper enhances coarse-graining simulations by integrating machine learning potentials (MLPs) with enhanced sampling methods, addressing limitations in sampling efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current coarse-graining approaches rely on equilibrium sampling for force matching, which requires extensive atomistic trajectories and poorly samples transition regions, leading to inefficiencies and inaccuracies.

Method: Enhanced sampling is applied to bias along CG degrees of freedom for data generation, followed by force recomputation with the unbiased potential, ensuring thermodynamic consistency and improving sampling data quality.

Result: The strategy reduces the simulation time required for equilibration and improves sampling in transition regions while preserving the correct potential of mean force (PMF). Demonstrations with the M"uller-Brown potential and capped alanine show notable improvements.

Conclusion: Enhanced sampling for force matching is a promising method for improving coarse-graining machine learning potentials, enhancing accuracy and reliability in molecular dynamics simulations.

Abstract: Coarse-graining (CG) enables molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of larger
systems and longer timescales that are otherwise infeasible with atomistic
models. Machine learning potentials (MLPs), with their capacity to capture
many-body interactions, can provide accurate approximations of the potential of
mean force (PMF) in CG models. Current CG MLPs are typically trained in a
bottom-up manner via force matching, which in practice relies on configurations
sampled from the unbiased equilibrium Boltzmann distribution to ensure
thermodynamic consistency. This convention poses two key limitations: first,
sufficiently long atomistic trajectories are needed to reach convergence; and
second, even once equilibrated, transition regions remain poorly sampled. To
address these issues, we employ enhanced sampling to bias along CG degrees of
freedom for data generation, and then recompute the forces with respect to the
unbiased potential. This strategy simultaneously shortens the simulation time
required to produce equilibrated data and enriches sampling in transition
regions, while preserving the correct PMF. We demonstrate its effectiveness on
the M\"uller-Brown potential and capped alanine, achieving notable
improvements. Our findings support the use of enhanced sampling for force
matching as a promising direction to improve the accuracy and reliability of CG
MLPs.

### [945] [Leveraging Cellular Automata for Real-Time Wildfire Spread Modeling in California](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09708)
*Connor Weinhouse,Jameson Augustin*

Main category: physics.soc-ph

TL;DR: The study presents a lightweight fire prediction model based on cellular automata (CA) that achieves a balance between accuracy and real-world applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models for wildfire prediction either lack predictive accuracy or are impractical for operational use. Wildfires are increasingly destructive, necessitating improved tools for fire suppression and public safety.

Method: The authors developed a cellular automata (CA)-based model incorporating environmental variables such as NDVI, wind speed/direction, and slope. The model leverages open-access data and was evaluated for effectiveness using confusion matrices and burn scars from the 2025 Pacific Palisades Fire.

Result: The model achieved a recall of 0.860, a precision of 0.605, and an F1 score of 0.711 over 50 optimization trials. Each simulation required an average of 1.22 seconds.

Conclusion: CA-based models can effectively balance accuracy and operational efficiency, aiding real-time wildfire suppression and public safety initiatives.

Abstract: Wildfires are becoming increasingly frequent and devastating, and therefore
the technology to combat them must adapt accordingly. Modern predictive models
have failed to balance predictive accuracy and operational viability, resulting
in consistently delayed or misinformed fire suppression and public safety
efforts. The present study addresses this gap by developing and validating a
predictive model based on cellular automata (CA) that incorporates key
environmental variables, including vegetation density (NDVI), wind speed and
direction, and topographic slope derived from open-access datasets. The
presented CA framework offers a lightweight alternative to data-heavy
approaches that fail in emergency contexts. Evaluation of the model using a
confusion matrix against burn scars from the 2025 Pacific Palisades Fire
yielded a recall of 0.860, a precision of 0.605, and an overall F1 score of
0.711 after 50 parameter optimization trials, with each simulation taking an
average of 1.22 seconds. CA-based models can bridge the gap between accuracy
and applicability, successfully guiding public safety and fire suppression
efforts.

*Antonio Martínez-Ibarra,Aurora González-Vidal,Adrián Cánovas-Rodríguez,Antonio F. Skarmeta*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper develops a depth-specific chlorophyll-a monitoring methodology for the Mar Menor, integrating satellite imagery, buoy-based data, and machine learning models. It provides accurate predictions across different depths and delivers a scalable monitoring framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in traditional chlorophyll-a monitoring methods, which are often restricted to surface data and limited timeframes, and to enhance early warnings for harmful algal blooms.

Method: The study integrates satellite Sentinel 2 imagery and buoy-based data over multi-depth levels to train and validate machine learning models, including RF, XGBoost, CatBoost, and neural networks, using atmospheric correction, band-combination experiments, and spatial aggregation.

Result: The methodology showed high predictive accuracy (R2 values from 0.66 to 0.89 depending on depth) in reproducing eutrophication events. The models provided reliable maps of chlorophyll-a across various depths.

Conclusion: The depth-specific chlorophyll monitoring approach developed in this study is robust, scalable, and transferable to other coastal systems, making it a valuable tool for environmental monitoring and management.

Abstract: The Mar Menor, Europe's largest coastal lagoon, located in Spain, has
undergone severe eutrophication crises. Monitoring chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) is
essential to anticipate harmful algal blooms and guide mitigation. Traditional
in situ measurements are spatially and temporally limited. Satellite-based
approaches provide a more comprehensive view, enabling scalable, long-term, and
transferable monitoring. This study aims to overcome limitations of chlorophyll
monitoring, often restricted to surface estimates or limited temporal coverage,
by developing a reliable methodology to predict and map Chl-a across the water
column of the Mar Menor. The work integrates Sentinel 2 imagery with buoy-based
ground truth to create models capable of high-resolution, depth-specific
monitoring, enhancing early-warning capabilities for eutrophication. Nearly a
decade of Sentinel 2 images was atmospherically corrected using C2RCC
processors. Buoy data were aggregated by depth (0-1 m, 1-2 m, 2-3 m, 3-4 m).
Multiple ML and DL algorithms-including RF, XGBoost, CatBoost, Multilater
Perceptron Networks, and ensembles-were trained and validated using
cross-validation. Systematic band-combination experiments and spatial
aggregation strategies were tested to optimize prediction. Results show
depth-dependent performance. At the surface, C2X-Complex with XGBoost and
ensemble models achieved R2 = 0.89; at 1-2 m, CatBoost and ensemble models
reached R2 = 0.87; at 2-3 m, TOA reflectances with KNN performed best (R2 =
0.81); while at 3-4 m, RF achieved R2 = 0.66. Generated maps successfully
reproduced known eutrophication events (e.g., 2016 crisis, 2025 surge),
confirming robustness. The study delivers an end-to-end, validated methodology
for depth-specific Chl-amapping. Its integration of multispectral band
combinations, buoy calibration, and ML/DL modeling offers a transferable
framework for other turbid coastal systems.

### [947] [Generative Latent Video Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09987)
*Zongyu Guo,Zhaoyang Jia,Jiahao Li,Xiaoyi Zhang,Bin Li,Yan Lu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Generative Latent Video Compression (GLVC), a new framework for video compression that achieves state-of-the-art perceptual quality while reducing bitrate significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of balancing the rate-distortion-perception tradeoff in video compression, especially to mitigate flickering artifacts caused by frame-wise quality fluctuations in perceptually optimized neural video codecs.

Method: GLVC employs a pretrained continuous tokenizer to align video frames into a perceptual latent space, along with codec architecture redesigns such as unified intra/inter coding and a recurrent memory mechanism, all tailored for the latent domain.

Result: GLVC achieves state-of-the-art performance based on DISTS and LPIPS metrics. It rivals advanced neural video codecs with nearly half the bitrate while maintaining consistent temporal quality, as confirmed by a user study.

Conclusion: GLVC demonstrates a significant advancement in perceptual video compression by reducing bitrate without compromising perceptual quality, offering practical improvements for real-world applications.

Abstract: Perceptual optimization is widely recognized as essential for neural
compression, yet balancing the rate-distortion-perception tradeoff remains
challenging. This difficulty is especially pronounced in video compression,
where frame-wise quality fluctuations often cause perceptually optimized neural
video codecs to suffer from flickering artifacts. In this paper, inspired by
the success of latent generative models, we present Generative Latent Video
Compression (GLVC), an effective framework for perceptual video compression.
GLVC employs a pretrained continuous tokenizer to project video frames into a
perceptually aligned latent space, thereby offloading perceptual constraints
from the rate-distortion optimization. We redesign the codec architecture
explicitly for the latent domain, drawing on extensive insights from prior
neural video codecs, and further equip it with innovations such as unified
intra/inter coding and a recurrent memory mechanism. Experimental results
across multiple benchmarks show that GLVC achieves state-of-the-art performance
in terms of DISTS and LPIPS metrics. Notably, our user study confirms GLVC
rivals the latest neural video codecs at nearly half their rate while
maintaining stable temporal coherence, marking a step toward practical
perceptual video compression.

*Shanzhi Yin,Bolin Chen,Xinju Wu,Ru-Ling Liao,Jie Chen,Shiqi Wang,Yan Ye*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper presents an ultra-efficient method for compressing 3D human avatar videos using human priors and deformation techniques, achieving better compression and visual results at lower bit rates compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable immersive multimedia experiences in the metaverse by addressing the challenge of compressing high-quality 3D human avatar videos at ultra-low bit rates.

Method: The authors propose a framework that utilizes a canonical Gaussian avatar and human-prior templates to separate appearance and temporal evolution. Compact parametric representations are encoded minimally, while canonical deformation via Linear Blend Skinning facilitates video reconstruction.

Result: Experimental results show superior rate-distortion performance over conventional 2D/3D codecs and existing 3D Gaussian splatting methods on multi-view human video datasets.

Conclusion: The method enhances compression efficiency and video quality for 3D human avatars, promoting advanced applications in immersive virtual environments.

Abstract: This paper proposes an efficient 3D avatar coding framework that leverages
compact human priors and canonical-to-target transformation to enable
high-quality 3D human avatar video compression at ultra-low bit rates. The
framework begins by training a canonical Gaussian avatar using articulated
splatting in a network-free manner, which serves as the foundation for avatar
appearance modeling. Simultaneously, a human-prior template is employed to
capture temporal body movements through compact parametric representations.
This decomposition of appearance and temporal evolution minimizes redundancy,
enabling efficient compression: the canonical avatar is shared across the
sequence, requiring compression only once, while the temporal parameters,
consisting of just 94 parameters per frame, are transmitted with minimal
bit-rate. For each frame, the target human avatar is generated by deforming
canonical avatar via Linear Blend Skinning transformation, facilitating
temporal coherent video reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms
conventional 2D/3D codecs and existing learnable dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting
compression method in terms of rate-distortion performance on mainstream
multi-view human video datasets, paving the way for seamless immersive
multimedia experiences in meta-verse applications.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a benchmark and proposes a novel lightweight CNN for perceptual image compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving perceptual compression efficiency while addressing computational expenses and the lack of benchmarks.

Method: Developed an open-source benchmark (FJNDF-Pytorch) and a lightweight CNN within a learning framework.

Result: Proposed method achieves top-tier compression efficiency and drastically reduces computational cost.

Conclusion: The work offers a reproducible, high-performance, efficient solution for frequency-domain JND-guided pre-filters.

Abstract: Just Noticeable Distortion (JND)-guided pre-filter is a promising technique
for improving the perceptual compression efficiency of image coding. However,
existing methods are often computationally expensive, and the field lacks
standardized benchmarks for fair comparison. To address these challenges, this
paper introduces a twofold contribution. First, we develop and open-source
FJNDF-Pytorch, a unified benchmark for frequency-domain JND-Guided pre-filters.
Second, leveraging this platform, we propose a complete learning framework for
a novel, lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art compression
efficiency, consistently outperforming competitors across multiple datasets and
encoders. In terms of computational cost, our model is exceptionally
lightweight, requiring only 7.15 GFLOPs to process a 1080p image, which is
merely 14.1% of the cost of recent lightweight network. Our work presents a
robust, state-of-the-art solution that excels in both performance and
efficiency, supported by a reproducible research platform. The open-source
implementation is available at https://github.com/viplab-fudan/FJNDF-Pytorch.

TL;DR: The study developed a universal deep learning model for tumour segmentation across different cancer types, showing high performance comparable to specialized models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to create a universal model for tumour segmentation to enable consistent and automated analysis across diverse cancer types and patient populations, minimizing reliance on specialized models.

Method: The model was trained using over 20,000 histopathological images from 4,000 patients across colorectal, endometrial, lung, and prostate cancers. Validation involved external cohorts and exploratory analysis on The Cancer Genome Atlas data.

Result: The universal model achieved an average Dice coefficient of over 80% across external validation sets and exploratory analyses, maintaining performance comparable to specialized cancer-specific models.

Conclusion: A single universal tumour segmentation model can effectively handle multiple cancer types and diverse patient data, providing robust and generalized performance without downgrading accuracy.

Abstract: Deep learning is expected to aid pathologists by automating tasks such as
tumour segmentation. We aimed to develop one universal tumour segmentation
model for histopathological images and examine its performance in different
cancer types. The model was developed using over 20 000 whole-slide images from
over 4 000 patients with colorectal, endometrial, lung, or prostate carcinoma.
Performance was validated in pre-planned analyses on external cohorts with over
3 000 patients across six cancer types. Exploratory analyses included over 1
500 additional patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Average Dice coefficient
was over 80% in all validation cohorts with en bloc resection specimens and in
The Cancer Genome Atlas cohorts. No loss of performance was observed when
comparing the universal model with models specialised on single cancer types.
In conclusion, extensive and rigorous evaluations demonstrate that generic
tumour segmentation by a single model is possible across cancer types, patient
populations, sample preparations, and slide scanners.

### [951] [ROBOPSY PL[AI]: Using Role-Play to Investigate how LLMs Present Collective Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09874)
*Margarete Jahrmann,Thomas Brandstetter,Stefan Glasauer*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) curate collective memory through a role-playing game in a public installation, analyzing user interaction and LLM-generated content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research investigates the dynamics of LLMs in curating and presenting historical narratives to engage with collective memory.

Method: An artistic installation allowed visitors to interact with various LLMs simulating a role-playing scenario. Data was collected through user interactions and analyzed using natural language processing techniques.

Result: Analyses revealed three distinct user types based on qualitative feedback and significant variations in historical narrative presentation among the LLMs in the quantitative study.

Conclusion: The study enhances understanding of LLM performance and introduces a novel, engaging method for public dissemination of this research.

Abstract: The paper presents the first results of an artistic research project
investigating how Large Language Models (LLMs) curate and present collective
memory. In a public installation exhibited during two months in Vienna in 2025,
visitors could interact with five different LLMs (ChatGPT with GPT 4o and GPT
4o mini, Mistral Large, DeepSeek-Chat, and a locally run Llama 3.1 model),
which were instructed to act as narrators, implementing a role-playing game
revolving around the murder of Austrian philosopher Moritz Schlick in 1936.
Results of the investigation include protocols of LLM-user interactions during
the game and qualitative conversations after the play experience to get insight
into the players' reactions to the game. In a quantitative analysis 115
introductory texts for role-playing generated by the LLMs were examined by
different methods of natural language processing, including semantic similarity
and sentiment analysis. While the qualitative player feedback allowed to
distinguish three distinct types of users, the quantitative text analysis
showed significant differences between how the different LLMs presented the
historical content. Our study thus adds to ongoing efforts to analyse LLM
performance, but also suggests a way of how these efforts can be disseminated
in a playful way to a general audience.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: ALLOY introduces a demonstration-based system for customizing large language model (LLM) agents, overcoming limitations of traditional prompt-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt-based interactions struggle with capturing procedural requirements and user preferences in tasks without factually correct solutions, such as social media content creation or trip planning.

Method: The authors propose ALLOY, a system grounded in Programming by Demonstration (PBD), allowing users to give procedural demonstrations, visualize workflows, and adapt them for varied tasks.

Result: In user studies, ALLOY's demo-based interaction outperformed both prompt-based agents and manual workflows in accurately capturing user intent and preferences.

Conclusion: Demonstration-based systems like ALLOY complement prompt-based methods, enhancing ease of use, workflow generalization, and adaptability for complex tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enable end-users to delegate complex tasks to
autonomous agents through natural language. However, prompt-based interaction
faces critical limitations: Users often struggle to specify procedural
requirements for tasks, especially those that don't have a factually correct
solution but instead rely on personal preferences, such as posting social media
content or planning a trip. Additionally, a ''successful'' prompt for one task
may not be reusable or generalizable across similar tasks. We present ALLOY, a
system inspired by classical HCI theories on Programming by Demonstration
(PBD), but extended to enhance adaptability in creating LLM-based web agents.
ALLOY enables users to express procedural preferences through natural
demonstrations rather than prompts, while making these procedures transparent
and editable through visualized workflows that can be generalized across task
variations. In a study with 12 participants, ALLOY's demonstration--based
approach outperformed prompt-based agents and manual workflows in capturing
user intent and procedural preferences in complex web tasks. Insights from the
study also show how demonstration--based interaction complements the
traditional prompt-based approach.

### [953] [How AI Companionship Develops: Evidence from a Longitudinal Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10079)
*Angel Hsing-Chi Hwang,Fiona Li,Jacy Reese Anthis,Hayoun Noh*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper examines how mental models, agency, and interaction shape AI companionship, using surveys and longitudinal studies to map its psychological and social impacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing adoption of AI companions raises concerns about their influence on mental health, social relationships, and overall wellbeing, requiring a deeper understanding of user-AI interaction processes and effects.

Method: Two studies were conducted: a survey of AI companion users (N=303) to explore the psychological pathways, and a longitudinal study with 110 participants using a generic chatbot to observe changes in perceptions over time.

Result: The survey highlighted key factors such as mental models, agency, and engagement in shaping AI companionship. The longitudinal study showed that perceptions of generic chatbots converged with users' views of their AI companions within three weeks.

Conclusion: AI companionship evolves through a complex interplay of psychological variables, and the paper introduces an empirical framework for studying these dynamics over time.

Abstract: The quickly growing popularity of AI companions poses risks to mental health,
personal wellbeing, and social relationships. Past work has identified many
individual factors that can drive human-companion interaction, but we know
little about how these factors interact and evolve over time. In Study 1, we
surveyed AI companion users (N = 303) to map the psychological pathway from
users' mental models of the agent to parasocial experiences, social
interaction, and the psychological impact of AI companions. Participants'
responses foregrounded multiple interconnected variables (agency, parasocial
interaction, and engagement) that shape AI companionship. In Study 2, we
conducted a longitudinal study with a subset of participants (N = 110) using a
new generic chatbot. Participants' perceptions of the generic chatbot
significantly converged to perceptions of their own companions by Week 3. These
results suggest a longitudinal model of AI companionship development and
demonstrate an empirical method to study human-AI companionship.

### [954] [Revisiting Trust in the Era of Generative AI: Factorial Structure and Latent Profiles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10199)
*Haocan Sun,Weizi Liu,Di Wu,Guoming Yu,Mike Yao*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The study introduces the Human-AI Trust Scale (HAITS) to measure both rational and relational trust in generative AI (GenAI) systems, identifying four trust dimensions and six user trust profiles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing trust studies in AI focus on functionality (e.g., reliability, accuracy) while neglecting social and emotional dimensions, which are crucial for GenAI systems that act as partners rather than just tools.

Method: The researchers developed and validated the HAITS through qualitative interviews and two large-scale surveys in China and the US, involving exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses and latent profile analysis.

Result: The study identified four trust dimensions (Affective Trust, Competence Trust, Benevolence & Integrity, and Perceived Risk) and six distinct user trust profiles, showing cultural and individual differences in trust frameworks.

Conclusion: The HAITS offers a validated, culturally sensitive tool for studying trust in GenAI, facilitating better research and design for trustworthy AI while combining instrumental and relational trust perspectives.

Abstract: Trust is one of the most important factors shaping whether and how people
adopt and rely on artificial intelligence (AI). Yet most existing studies
measure trust in terms of functionality, focusing on whether a system is
reliable, accurate, or easy to use, while giving less attention to the social
and emotional dimensions that are increasingly relevant for today's generative
AI (GenAI) systems. These systems do not just process information; they
converse, respond, and collaborate with users, blurring the line between tool
and partner. In this study, we introduce and validate the Human-AI Trust Scale
(HAITS), a new measure designed to capture both the rational and relational
aspects of trust in GenAI. Drawing on prior trust theories, qualitative
interviews, and two waves of large-scale surveys in China and the United
States, we used exploratory (n = 1,546) and confirmatory (n = 1,426) factor
analyses to identify four key dimensions of trust: Affective Trust, Competence
Trust, Benevolence & Integrity, and Perceived Risk. We then applied latent
profile analysis to classify users into six distinct trust profiles, revealing
meaningful differences in how affective-competence trust and trust-distrust
frameworks coexist across individuals and cultures. Our findings offer a
validated, culturally sensitive tool for measuring trust in GenAI and provide
new insight into how trust evolves in human-AI interaction. By integrating
instrumental and relational perspectives of trust, this work lays the
foundation for more nuanced research and design of trustworthy AI systems.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This study developed a framework using machine learning and behavioral analysis to identify gamer archetypes, aiding game design and digital well-being.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding gamers' personas can improve adaptive game design and contribute to digital well-being.

Method: Data-driven framework using surveys, correlation statistics, dimensionality-reduction, and clustering algorithms.

Result: Four gamer archetypes identified with clustering: Immersive Social Story-Seekers, Disciplined Optimizers, Strategic Systems Navigators, Competitive Team-Builders.

Conclusion: The study highlights the use of machine learning for enhanced gamer profiling, linking gameplay motivations to psychological outcomes.

Abstract: Profiling gamers provides critical insights for adaptive game design,
behavioral understanding, and digital well-being. This study proposes an
integrated, data-driven framework that combines psychological measures,
behavioral analytics, and machine learning to reveal underlying gamer personas.
A structured survey of 250 participants, including 113 active gamers, captured
multidimensional behavioral, motivational, and social data. The analysis
pipeline integrated feature engineering, association-network, knowledge-graph
analysis, and unsupervised clustering to extract meaningful patterns.
Correlation statistics uses Cramers V, Tschuprows T, Theils U, and Spearmans
quantified feature associations, and network centrality guided feature
selection. Dimensionality-reduction techniques such as PCA, SVD, t-SNE are
coupled with clustering algorithms like K-Means, Agglomerative, Spectral,
DBSCAN, evaluated using Silhouette, Calinski Harabasz, and Davies Bouldin
indices. The PCA with K-Means with k = 4 model achieved optimal cluster quality
with Silhouette = 0.4, identifying four archetypes as Immersive Social
Story-Seekers, Disciplined Optimizers, Strategic Systems Navigators, and
Competitive Team-Builders. This research contributes a reproducible pipeline
that links correlation-driven network insights with unsupervised learning. The
integration of behavioral correlation networks with clustering not only
enhances classification accuracy but also offers a holistic lens to connect
gameplay motivations with psychological and wellness outcomes.

*Shalaleh Rismani,Renee Shelby,Leah Davis,Negar Rostamzadeh,AJung Moon*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper discusses the fragmented and incomplete nature of AI system evaluation measures and advocates for a systems-level approach for better understanding, regulation, and mitigation of harms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing need for evaluating social and ethical implications of AI systems in a comprehensive way, overcoming fragmented practices associated with current measures.

Method: The authors conducted a scoping review of nearly 800 measures related to 11 AI ethics principles, analyzing them for alignment with AI system components, attributes, hazards, and harms.

Result: Most measures focus on principles like fairness, transparency, privacy, and trust, and primarily assess model or output components. However, they fail to account for system-wide interactions or offer meaningful harm thresholds.

Conclusion: Current evaluation practices are inadequate for capturing the systems-level emergence of harms. A framework that integrates measures across system attributes, hazards, and harms is crucial for regulatory and actionable advancements in AI ethics.

Abstract: Over the past decade, an ecosystem of measures has emerged to evaluate the
social and ethical implications of AI systems, largely shaped by high-level
ethics principles. These measures are developed and used in fragmented ways,
without adequate attention to how they are situated in AI systems. In this
paper, we examine how existing measures used in the computing literature map to
AI system components, attributes, hazards, and harms. Our analysis draws on a
scoping review resulting in nearly 800 measures corresponding to 11 AI ethics
principles. We find that most measures focus on four principles - fairness,
transparency, privacy, and trust - and primarily assess model or output system
components. Few measures account for interactions across system elements, and
only a narrow set of hazards is typically considered for each harm type. Many
measures are disconnected from where harm is experienced and lack guidance for
setting meaningful thresholds. These patterns reveal how current evaluation
practices remain fragmented, measuring in pieces rather than capturing how
harms emerge across systems. Framing measures with respect to system
attributes, hazards, and harms can strengthen regulatory oversight, support
actionable practices in industry, and ground future research in systems-level
understanding.

*Ryota Takamidoa,Chiharu Suzukia,Hiroki Nakamoto*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper presents the Personalized Motion Guidance Framework (PMGF) employing AI for tailored athlete coaching through motion pattern refinement, validated through a baseball pitcher study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to bridge the gap between group-level sports science insights and the individualized coaching needed for personalized athletic performance enhancement.

Method: The PMGF uses a vertical autoencoder to generate athlete-specific motion sequences, employing interpolation and optimization strategies for personalized motion refinement.

Result: The framework was validated with data from 51 baseball pitchers, demonstrating successful motion pattern transitions and biomechanically plausible improvements in performance-enhancing characteristics.

Conclusion: PMGF shows potential for improving athletic performance with individualized motion guidance, and a proposed extension (general-PMGF) aims to enhance real-world applicability across sports.

Abstract: A critical challenge in contemporary sports science lies in filling the gap
between group-level insights derived from controlled hypothesis-driven
experiments and the real-world need for personalized coaching tailored to
individual athletes' unique movement patterns. This study developed a
Personalized Motion Guidance Framework (PMGF) to enhance athletic performance
by generating individualized motion-refinement guides using generative
artificial intelligence techniques. PMGF leverages a vertical autoencoder to
encode motion sequences into athlete-specific latent representations, which can
then be directly manipulated to generate meaningful guidance motions. Two
manipulation strategies were explored: (1) smooth interpolation between the
learner's motion and a target (e.g., expert) motion to facilitate observational
learning, and (2) shifting the motion pattern in an optimal direction in the
latent space using a local optimization technique. The results of the
validation experiment with data from 51 baseball pitchers revealed that (1)
PMGF successfully generated smooth transitions in motion patterns between
individuals across all 1,275 pitcher pairs, and (2) the features significantly
altered through PMGF manipulations reflected known performance-enhancing
characteristics, such as increased stride length and knee extension associated
with higher ball velocity, indicating that PMGF induces biomechanically
plausible improvements. We propose a future extension called general-PMGF to
enhance the applicability of this framework. This extension incorporates
bodily, environmental, and task constraints into the generation process, aiming
to provide more realistic and versatile guidance across diverse sports
contexts.

### [959] [Therapeutic AI and the Hidden Risks of Over-Disclosure: An Embedded AI-Literacy Framework for Mental Health Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10805)
*Soraya S. Anvari,Rina R. Wehbe*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper discusses privacy and safety challenges in using Large Language Models (LLMs) for mental health purposes, proposing an AI literacy framework to mitigate these risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is the increasing deployment of LLMs in mental health contexts, which poses potential privacy and safety risks due to lack of structured data handling and over-disclosure of sensitive information.

Method: The authors propose embedding an AI literacy framework within mental health LLM-based conversational systems and plan a study to assess its impact on improving user safety, trust, and experience.

Result: The proposed framework intends to address issues such as over-disclosure, LLM biases, and data misuse by improving users' understanding of AI systems.

Conclusion: Embedding AI literacy interventions into mental health systems utilizing LLMs can improve data handling, safeguard user privacy, and optimize trust in such technologies.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in mental health
contexts, from structured therapeutic support tools to informal chat-based
well-being assistants. While these systems increase accessibility, scalability,
and personalization, their integration into mental health care brings privacy
and safety challenges that have not been well-examined. Unlike traditional
clinical interactions, LLM-mediated therapy often lacks a clear structure for
what information is collected, how it is processed, and how it is stored or
reused. Users without clinical guidance may over-disclose personal information,
which is sometimes irrelevant to their presenting concern, due to misplaced
trust, lack of awareness of data risks, or the conversational design of the
system. This overexposure raises privacy concerns and also increases the
potential for LLM bias, misinterpretation, and long-term data misuse. We
propose a framework embedding Artificial Intelligence (AI) literacy
interventions directly into mental health conversational systems, and outline a
study plan to evaluate their impact on disclosure safety, trust, and user
experience.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper proposes an agent-based system using large language models to interact with machines in natural language via the OPC UA communication standard. Commands can be text-based or verbal, achieving high accuracy in execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a natural and efficient human-machine interaction method, moving away from traditional touch interfaces.

Method: Large language models equipped with predefined tools interface with OPC UA servers, processing commands and returning outputs, without the need for fine-tuning or additional training data.

Result: Evaluated with synthetic commands on Siemens S7-1500 controllers, achieving 96%-98% accuracy with proprietary models and 90% with open-weight models.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of natural language-based human-machine interaction in industrial settings, advancing interface technology.

Abstract: This paper proposes an agent-based approach toward a more natural interface
between humans and machines. Large language models equipped with tools and the
communication standard OPC UA are utilized to control machines in natural
language. Instead of touch interaction, which is currently the state-of-the-art
medium for interaction in operations, the proposed approach enables operators
to talk or text with machines. This allows commands such as 'Please decrease
the temperature by 20 % in machine 1 and set the motor speed to 5000 rpm in
machine 2.' The large language model receives the user input and selects one of
three predefined tools that connect to an OPC UA server and either change or
read the value of a node. Afterwards, the result of the tool execution is
passed back to the language model, which then provides a final response to the
user. The approach is universally designed and can therefore be applied to any
machine that supports the OPC UA standard. The large language model is neither
fine-tuned nor requires training data, only the relevant machine credentials
and a parameter dictionary are included within the system prompt. The approach
is evaluated on a Siemens S7-1500 programmable logic controller with four
machine parameters in a case study of fifty synthetically generated commands on
five different models. The results demonstrate high success rate, with
proprietary GPT 5 models achieving accuracies between 96.0 % and 98.0 %, and
open-weight models reaching up to 90.0 %. The proposed approach of this
empirical study contributes to advancing natural interaction in industrial
human-machine interfaces.

*Alex Ayoub,Samuel Robertson,Dawen Liang,Harald Steck,Nathan Kallus*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Matrix factorization for top-N recommendations performs comparably without weighting schemes, challenging prior assumptions, though weighting benefits lower-capacity models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Matrix factorization is commonly used for recommendation tasks, but despite widespread adoption of weighting strategies for implicit feedback, there is limited understanding of their effectiveness.

Method: The study empirically evaluates various weighting strategies and matrix factorization approaches, analyzing their performance and deriving efficient algorithms for minimizing weighted objectives.

Result: Training with unweighted data often matches or surpasses the performance of weighted data approaches, particularly in large models, but benefits lower-capacity models under certain circumstances.

Conclusion: Weighting schemes are not universally effective; unweighted training performs well for large models, and certain weighting strategies remain beneficial depending on model capacity and regularization constraints.

Abstract: Matrix factorization is a widely used approach for top-N recommendation and
collaborative filtering. When implemented on implicit feedback data (such as
clicks), a common heuristic is to upweight the observed interactions. This
strategy has been shown to improve performance for certain algorithms. In this
paper, we conduct a systematic study of various weighting schemes and matrix
factorization algorithms. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that training with
unweighted data can perform comparably to, and sometimes outperform, training
with weighted data, especially for large models. This observation challenges
the conventional wisdom. Nevertheless, we identify cases where weighting can be
beneficial, particularly for models with lower capacity and specific
regularization schemes. We also derive efficient algorithms for exactly
minimizing several weighted objectives that were previously considered
computationally intractable. Our work provides a comprehensive analysis of the
interplay between weighting, regularization, and model capacity in matrix
factorization for recommender systems.

### [962] [CardRewriter: Leveraging Knowledge Cards for Long-Tail Query Rewriting on Short-Video Platforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10095)
*Peiyuan Gong,Feiran Zhu,Yaqi Yin,Chenglei Dai,Chao Zhang,Kai Zheng,Wentian Bao,Jiaxin Mao,Yi Zhang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: CardRewriter offers a solution to enhance long-tail query rewriting for short-video platforms using domain-specific knowledge and a specialized LLM framework, improving retrieval accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Short-video platform queries often suffer from errors and ambiguity, leading to mismatches with retrieved content. There's a need for an effective query rewriting method tailored to these platforms.

Method: CardRewriter leverages a domain-specific framework with LLMs enriched by knowledge cards, followed by a two-stage training pipeline combining supervised fine-tuning and group relative policy optimization with custom rewards.

Result: Both offline experiments and online testing show that CardRewriter improves rewriting quality, increases engagement metrics like LVR and CTR, and reduces query reformulations.

Conclusion: CardRewriter demonstrates its efficiency and scalability by being deployed on a major platform, successfully optimizing user search experiences on short-video platforms.

Abstract: Short-video platforms have rapidly become a new generation of information
retrieval systems, where users formulate queries to access desired videos.
However, user queries, especially long-tail ones, often suffer from spelling
errors, incomplete phrasing, and ambiguous intent, resulting in mismatches
between user expectations and retrieved results. While large language models
(LLMs) have shown success in long-tail query rewriting within e-commerce, they
struggle on short-video platforms, where proprietary content such as short
videos, live streams, micro dramas, and user social networks falls outside
their training distribution. To address this challenge, we introduce
\textbf{CardRewriter}, an LLM-based framework that incorporates domain-specific
knowledge to enhance long-tail query rewriting. For each query, our method
aggregates multi-source knowledge relevant to the query and summarizes it into
an informative and query-relevant knowledge card. This card then guides the LLM
to better capture user intent and produce more effective query rewrites. We
optimize CardRewriter using a two-stage training pipeline: supervised
fine-tuning followed by group relative policy optimization, with a tailored
reward system balancing query relevance and retrieval effectiveness. Offline
experiments show that CardRewriter substantially improves rewriting quality for
queries targeting proprietary content. Online A/B testing further confirms
significant gains in long-view rate (LVR) and click-through rate (CTR), along
with a notable reduction in initiative query reformulation rate (IQRR). Since
September 2025, CardRewriter has been deployed on Kuaishou, one of China's
largest short-video platforms, serving hundreds of millions of users daily.

*Shubham Chatterjee,Jeff Dalton*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper introduces QDER, a neural re-ranking model that unifies entity-oriented and multi-vector approaches for improved search ranking through a method called "late aggregation."


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between entity-oriented approaches using knowledge graphs and multi-vector models designed for fine-grained semantic representation in neural IR systems.

Method: QDER integrates knowledge graph semantics in a multi-vector neural re-ranking model, using a method called "late aggregation" to maintain individual token and entity representations until the scoring stage. Learned attention patterns and precise mathematical operations are applied for better query-document matching.

Result: QDER achieves significant improvements in ranking performance with a 36% increase in nDCG@20 over baselines on TREC Robust 2004 and performs particularly well on difficult queries where traditional methods fail.

Conclusion: QDER demonstrates the potential of unifying entity- and semantic-focused approaches for improved information retrieval, establishing a groundwork for future entity-aware retrieval models.

Abstract: Neural IR has advanced through two distinct paths: entity-oriented approaches
leveraging knowledge graphs and multi-vector models capturing fine-grained
semantics. We introduce QDER, a neural re-ranking model that unifies these
approaches by integrating knowledge graph semantics into a multi-vector model.
QDER's key innovation lies in its modeling of query-document relationships:
rather than computing similarity scores on aggregated embeddings, we maintain
individual token and entity representations throughout the ranking process,
performing aggregation only at the final scoring stage - an approach we call
"late aggregation." We first transform these fine-grained representations
through learned attention patterns, then apply carefully chosen mathematical
operations for precise matches. Experiments across five standard benchmarks
show that QDER achieves significant performance gains, with improvements of 36%
in nDCG@20 over the strongest baseline on TREC Robust 2004 and similar
improvements on other datasets. QDER particularly excels on difficult queries,
achieving an nDCG@20 of 0.70 where traditional approaches fail completely
(nDCG@20 = 0.0), setting a foundation for future work in entity-aware
retrieval.

*Shubham Chatterjee*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: REGENT is a neural re-ranking model designed to enhance content selection for complex information needs by using entities as semantic anchors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural re-rankers struggle with processing lengthy, multi-faceted content effectively, often failing to prioritize key semantic signals critical to understanding.

Method: REGENT uses entities as a semantic skeleton to guide its attention mechanism. It integrates relevance guidance for both fine-grained lexical matches and high-level semantic reasoning.

Result: REGENT demonstrates up to 108% improvement over traditional methods (BM25) and outperforms established baselines like ColBERT and RankVicuna across three datasets.

Conclusion: This work sets a new benchmark in entity-aware information retrieval and offers a novel approach to integrating semantic entity guidance directly into neural attention processes.

Abstract: Current neural re-rankers often struggle with complex information needs and
long, content-rich documents. The fundamental issue is not computational--it is
intelligent content selection: identifying what matters in lengthy,
multi-faceted texts. While humans naturally anchor their understanding around
key entities and concepts, neural models process text within rigid token
windows, treating all interactions as equally important and missing critical
semantic signals. We introduce REGENT, a neural re-ranking model that mimics
human-like understanding by using entities as a "semantic skeleton" to guide
attention. REGENT integrates relevance guidance directly into the attention
mechanism, combining fine-grained lexical matching with high-level semantic
reasoning. This relevance-guided attention enables the model to focus on
conceptually important content while maintaining sensitivity to precise term
matches. REGENT achieves new state-of-the-art performance in three challenging
datasets, providing up to 108% improvement over BM25 and consistently
outperforming strong baselines including ColBERT and RankVicuna. To our
knowledge, this is the first work to successfully integrate entity semantics
directly into neural attention, establishing a new paradigm for entity-aware
information retrieval.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: FinVet is a novel framework addressing financial misinformation with adaptive verification, achieving notable improvements in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing urgent challenges of misinformation and lack of transparency in financial markets.

Method: Integrated multi-agent framework combining RAG pipelines, fact-checking, and adaptive confidence-weighted voting.

Result: Achieved an improved F1 score of 0.85, outperforming other individual pipelines and standalone approaches.

Conclusion: FinVet effectively enhances accuracy and transparency for misinformation detection in financial markets, offering key advancements over existing methods.

Abstract: Financial markets face growing threats from misinformation that can trigger
billions in losses in minutes. Most existing approaches lack transparency in
their decision-making and provide limited attribution to credible sources. We
introduce FinVet, a novel multi-agent framework that integrates two
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines with external fact-checking
through a confidence-weighted voting mechanism. FinVet employs adaptive
three-tier processing that dynamically adjusts verification strategies based on
retrieval confidence, from direct metadata extraction to hybrid reasoning to
full model-based analysis. Unlike existing methods, FinVet provides
evidence-backed verdicts, source attribution, confidence scores, and explicit
uncertainty flags when evidence is insufficient. Experimental evaluation on the
FinFact dataset shows that FinVet achieves an F1 score of 0.85, which is a
10.4% improvement over the best individual pipeline (fact-check pipeline) and
37% improvement over standalone RAG approaches.

*Xiao Yang,Peifeng Yin,Abe Engle,Jinfeng Zhuang,Ling Leng*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper focuses on a Multi-Task Multi-Domain architecture under a Two-Tower framework to optimize lightweight ad ranking in recommendation systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lightweight ad ranking layer is critical for balancing platform, advertiser, and user value in ad recommendation systems with multiple surfaces and optimization tasks.

Method: The authors introduced the MTMD architecture, featuring a mixture-of-expert design and domain adaptation modules to unify diverse prediction tasks, ad products, and serving surfaces.

Result: MTMD achieves 12%-36% improvement in offline loss value, translating to a 2% reduction in online cost per click. It replaced nine existing models in Pinterest's production system.

Conclusion: MTMD effectively unifies multitask and multidomain ad optimization in a single framework, enhancing operational efficiency and performance in real-world applications.

Abstract: The lightweight ad ranking layer, living after the retrieval stage and before
the fine ranker, plays a critical role in the success of a cascaded ad
recommendation system. Due to the fact that there are multiple optimization
tasks depending on the ad domain, e.g., Click Through Rate (CTR) for click ads
and Conversion Rate (CVR) for conversion ads, as well as multiple surfaces
where an ad is served (home feed, search, or related item recommendation) with
diverse ad products (shopping or standard ad); it is an essentially challenging
problem in industry on how to do joint holistic optimization in the lightweight
ranker, such that the overall platform's value, advertiser's value, and user's
value are maximized.
  Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based multitask learning (MTL) can handle multiple
goals naturally, with each prediction head mapping to a particular optimization
goal. However, in practice, it is unclear how to unify data from different
surfaces and ad products into a single model. It is critical to learn
domain-specialized knowledge and explicitly transfer knowledge between domains
to make MTL effective. We present a Multi-Task Multi-Domain (MTMD) architecture
under the classic Two-Tower paradigm, with the following key contributions: 1)
handle different prediction tasks, ad products, and ad serving surfaces in a
unified framework; 2) propose a novel mixture-of-expert architecture to learn
both specialized knowledge each domain and common knowledge shared between
domains; 3) propose a domain adaption module to encourage knowledge transfer
between experts; 4) constrain the modeling of different prediction tasks. MTMD
improves the offline loss value by 12% to 36%, mapping to 2% online reduction
in cost per click. We have deployed this single MTMD framework into production
for Pinterest ad recommendation replacing 9 production models.

TL;DR: VeritasFi improves financial Question Answering by addressing challenges in multi-modal data and company-specific adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG systems in finance struggle with heterogeneous data formats and balancing general and company-specific applicability.

Method: VeritasFi employs a multi-modal preprocessing pipeline, a hybrid retrieval engine, and a two-stage re-ranker training strategy.

Result: Improved adaptability and robustness for financial QA systems, capable of handling both general-domain and specialized tasks.

Conclusion: VeritasFi revolutionizes financial RAG systems by enhancing scalability, accuracy, and efficiency in QA tasks.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is becoming increasingly essential for
Question Answering (QA) in the financial sector, where accurate and
contextually grounded insights from complex public disclosures are crucial.
However, existing financial RAG systems face two significant challenges: (1)
they struggle to process heterogeneous data formats, such as text, tables, and
figures; and (2) they encounter difficulties in balancing general-domain
applicability with company-specific adaptation. To overcome these challenges,
we present VeritasFi, an innovative hybrid RAG framework that incorporates a
multi-modal preprocessing pipeline alongside a cutting-edge two-stage training
strategy for its re-ranking component. VeritasFi enhances financial QA through
three key innovations: (1) A multi-modal preprocessing pipeline that seamlessly
transforms heterogeneous data into a coherent, machine-readable format. (2) A
tripartite hybrid retrieval engine that operates in parallel, combining deep
multi-path retrieval over a semantically indexed document corpus, real-time
data acquisition through tool utilization, and an expert-curated memory bank
for high-frequency questions, ensuring comprehensive scope, accuracy, and
efficiency. (3) A two-stage training strategy for the document re-ranker, which
initially constructs a general, domain-specific model using anonymized data,
followed by rapid fine-tuning on company-specific data for targeted
applications. By integrating our proposed designs, VeritasFi presents a
groundbreaking framework that greatly enhances the adaptability and robustness
of financial RAG systems, providing a scalable solution for both general-domain
and company-specific QA tasks. Code accompanying this work is available at

### [968] [Comparative Explanations via Counterfactual Reasoning in Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10920)
*Yi Yu,Zhenxing Hu*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: CoCountER introduces a method to overcome inaccuracies in explainable recommendation systems by using comparative counterfactual explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods in explainable recommendation systems often produce factually inaccurate explanations when identifying influential aspects of items.

Method: CoCountER utilizes soft swap operations to create counterfactual data, providing explanations for recommendations involving comparative item pairs.

Result: Empirical experiments confirm the effectiveness of CoCountER in improving recommendation explanations.

Conclusion: CoCountER offers a reliable approach to generating factually accurate explanations in explainable recommendation systems through counterfactual reasoning.

Abstract: Explainable recommendation through counterfactual reasoning seeks to identify
the influential aspects of items in recommendations, which can then be used as
explanations. However, state-of-the-art approaches, which aim to minimize
changes in product aspects while reversing their recommended decisions
according to an aggregated decision boundary score, often lead to factual
inaccuracies in explanations. To solve this problem, in this work we propose a
novel method of Comparative Counterfactual Explanations for Recommendation
(CoCountER). CoCountER creates counterfactual data based on soft swap
operations, enabling explanations for recommendations of arbitrary pairs of
comparative items. Empirical experiments validate the effectiveness of our
approach.

### [969] [From Reasoning LLMs to BERT: A Two-Stage Distillation Framework for Search Relevance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11056)
*Runze Xia,Yupeng Ji,Yuxi Zhou,Haodong Liu,Teng Zhang,Piji Li*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for improving e-commerce search relevance prediction by distilling reasoning knowledge from large language models (LLMs) into lightweight models suitable for deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: E-commerce search systems need fast and accurate relevance predictions, but the latency of LLMs prevents their direct use.

Method: The approach involves a two-stage framework: first, a domain-adapted, reasoning-enabled teacher LLM is developed, and second, a lightweight student model undergoes Contrastive Reasoning Self-Distillation to inherit reasoning capabilities.

Result: The framework achieves measurable improvements in relevance prediction, validated via offline evaluations and online A/B testing in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed distillation framework effectively transfers reasoning capabilities to lightweight models, making them suitable for deployment under strict latency requirements in e-commerce applications.

Abstract: Query-service relevance prediction in e-commerce search systems faces strict
latency requirements that prevent the direct application of Large Language
Models (LLMs). To bridge this gap, we propose a two-stage reasoning
distillation framework to transfer reasoning capabilities from a powerful
teacher LLM to a lightweight, deployment-friendly student model. In the first
stage, we address the limitations of general-purpose LLMs by constructing a
domain-adapted teacher model. This is achieved through a three-step process:
domain-adaptive pre-training to inject platform knowledge, supervised
fine-tuning to elicit reasoning skills, and preference optimization with a
multi-dimensional reward model to ensure the generation of reliable and
preference-aligned reasoning paths. This teacher can then automatically
annotate massive query-service pairs from search logs with both relevance
labels and reasoning chains. In the second stage, to address the challenges of
architectural heterogeneity in standard distillation, we introduce Contrastive
Reasoning Self-Distillation (CRSD). By modeling the behavior of the same
student model under "standard" and "reasoning-augmented" inputs as a
teacher-student relationship, CRSD enables the lightweight model to internalize
the teacher's complex decision-making mechanisms without needing the explicit
reasoning path at inference. Offline evaluations and online A/B testing in the
Meituan search advertising system demonstrate that our framework achieves
significant improvements across multiple metrics, validating its effectiveness
and practical value.

### [970] [HoMer: Addressing Heterogeneities by Modeling Sequential and Set-wise Contexts for CTR Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11100)
*Shuwei Chen,Jiajun Cui,Zhengqi Xu,Fan Zhang,Jiangke Fan,Teng Zhang,Xingxing Wang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces HoMer, a unified Transformer-based model for CTR prediction that addresses feature, context, and architectural heterogeneity issues in industrial recommender systems, leading to improved performance, efficiency, and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the limitations caused by feature, context, and architecture heterogeneity in CTR prediction models, which impair predictive accuracy and operational efficiency in industrial recommender systems.

Method: HoMer aligns sequential and non-sequential features for better interest representation, shifts prediction from point-wise to set-wise for cross-item interaction, and employs a unified encoder-decoder architecture for efficient scalability and structural simplification.

Result: Compared to industrial baselines, HoMer achieves a 0.0099 AUC increase, boosts online CTR/RPM metrics by 1.99%/2.46%, and reduces GPU resource usage by 27%, enhancing both performance and cost-effectiveness.

Conclusion: HoMer is a practical and superior solution for CTR prediction, capable of scaling while optimizing predictive accuracy, computational efficiency, and operational costs.

Abstract: Click-through rate (CTR) prediction, which models behavior sequence and
non-sequential features (e.g., user/item profiles or cross features) to infer
user interest, underpins industrial recommender systems. However, most methods
face three forms of heterogeneity that degrade predictive performance: (i)
Feature Heterogeneity persists when limited sequence side features provide less
granular interest representation compared to extensive non-sequential features,
thereby impairing sequence modeling performance; (ii) Context Heterogeneity
arises because a user's interest in an item will be influenced by other items,
yet point-wise prediction neglects cross-item interaction context from the
entire item set; (iii) Architecture Heterogeneity stems from the fragmented
integration of specialized network modules, which compounds the model's
effectiveness, efficiency and scalability in industrial deployments. To tackle
the above limitations, we propose HoMer, a Homogeneous-Oriented TransforMer for
modeling sequential and set-wise contexts. First, we align sequence side
features with non-sequential features for accurate sequence modeling and
fine-grained interest representation. Second, we shift the prediction paradigm
from point-wise to set-wise, facilitating cross-item interaction in a highly
parallel manner. Third, HoMer's unified encoder-decoder architecture achieves
dual optimization through structural simplification and shared computation,
ensuring computational efficiency while maintaining scalability with model
size. Without arduous modification to the prediction pipeline, HoMer
successfully scales up and outperforms our industrial baseline by 0.0099 in the
AUC metric, and enhances online business metrics like CTR/RPM by 1.99%/2.46%.
Additionally, HoMer saves 27% of GPU resources via preliminary engineering
optimization, further validating its superiority and practicality.

### [971] [Characterizing Web Search in The Age of Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11560)
*Elisabeth Kirsten,Jost Grosse Perdekamp,Mihir Upadhyay,Krishna P. Gummadi,Muhammad Bilal Zafar*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper examines the difference between generative search (LLM-based) and traditional web search, highlighting variations in coverage, internal versus external knowledge reliance, and concept diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how generative search engines differ from traditional search engines in terms of output and functionality, and to explore implications for web search evaluation in the context of generative AI.

Method: Compared traditional Google search with four generative search engines by analyzing their outputs across queries in four domains.

Result: Identified that generative search covers a wider range of sources, varies in internal vs. external knowledge usage, and offers greater diversity and serendipity in surfaced concepts.

Conclusion: Generative search introduces new paradigms in information retrieval, suggesting the need to rethink web search evaluation criteria in the age of AI.

Abstract: The advent of LLMs has given rise to a new type of web search: Generative
search, where LLMs retrieve web pages related to a query and generate a single,
coherent text as a response. This output modality stands in stark contrast to
traditional web search, where results are returned as a ranked list of
independent web pages. In this paper, we ask: Along what dimensions do
generative search outputs differ from traditional web search? We compare
Google, a traditional web search engine, with four generative search engines
from two providers (Google and OpenAI) across queries from four domains. Our
analysis reveals intriguing differences. Most generative search engines cover a
wider range of sources compared to web search. Generative search engines vary
in the degree to which they rely on internal knowledge contained within the
model parameters v.s. external knowledge retrieved from the web. Generative
search engines surface varying sets of concepts, creating new opportunities for
enhancing search diversity and serendipity. Our results also highlight the need
for revisiting evaluation criteria for web search in the age of Generative AI.

*Felix Duelmer,Mohammad Farid Azampour,Nassir Navab*

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces UltraScatter, a fast, probabilistic ray tracing method for ultrasound simulation that creates realistic B-mode images within seconds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ultrasound simulation methods using wave equation solutions are accurate but computationally expensive, while convolution-based methods remain relatively slow, leading to a demand for faster and efficient alternatives.

Method: The authors developed UltraScatter, which utilizes probabilistic ray tracing with tissue represented as a volumetric field. Ray interactions are modeled using delta tracking, and phase information is incorporated via a time-of-flight model.

Result: UltraScatter generates B-mode ultrasound images within seconds, demonstrating realistic speckle and inclusion patterns in validation tests with phantom data.

Conclusion: UltraScatter provides a computationally scalable and efficient alternative to wave-based ultrasound simulation methods while maintaining realistic imaging features.

Abstract: Traditional ultrasound simulation methods solve wave equations numerically,
achieving high accuracy but at substantial computational cost. Faster
alternatives based on convolution with precomputed impulse responses remain
relatively slow, often requiring several minutes to generate a full B-mode
image. We introduce UltraScatter, a probabilistic ray tracing framework that
models ultrasound scattering efficiently and realistically. Tissue is
represented as a volumetric field of scattering probability and scattering
amplitude, and ray interactions are simulated via free-flight delta tracking.
Scattered rays are traced to the transducer, with phase information
incorporated through a linear time-of-flight model. Integrated with plane-wave
imaging and beamforming, our parallelized ray tracing architecture produces
B-mode images within seconds. Validation with phantom data shows realistic
speckle and inclusion patterns, positioning UltraScatter as a scalable
alternative to wave-based methods.

TL;DR: This paper presents a mechanism design framework for GenAI platforms to optimize revenue by screening users based on instrumental value and latency preferences using a token cap model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address how platforms can balance user-aligned model design and revenue optimization while mitigating misalignment pressures in generative AI systems.

Method: The paper introduces a mechanism design framework where token caps serve as the central tool for screening users and implements a revenue-optimal mechanism by deploying a single aligned model.

Result: The proposed framework achieves revenue optimization while decoupling model training from pricing and is practical using token metering for implementation.

Conclusion: The study concludes that using token caps simplifies the mechanism design, ensures alignment and implementability, and minimizes risks of misalignment for GenAI platforms.

Abstract: We build a mechanism design framework where a platform designs GenAI models
to screen users who obtain instrumental value from the generated conversation
and privately differ in their preference for latency. We show that the
revenue-optimal mechanism is simple: deploy a single aligned (user-optimal)
model and use token cap as the only instrument to screen the user. The design
decouples model training from pricing, is readily implemented with token
metering, and mitigates misalignment pressures.

### [974] [The algorithmic regulator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10300)
*Giulio Ruffini*

Main category: cs.CC

TL;DR: This paper reformulates the regulator theorem using algorithmic information theory (AIT), showing how an optimal controller or regulator theoretically contains a model of the system it regulates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of the regulator theorem, contextualizing it within AIT to extend its applicability and clarify its theoretical foundations. This is central to predictive brain theories and control systems.

Method: The authors model the world-regulator system as a self-delimiting program and investigate regulatory efficacy via algorithmic complexity measures. They define a 'good algorithmic regulator' as one that reduces output complexity relative to an unregulated baseline.

Result: The paper proves that a higher complexity reduction (∆) in the regulated system makes world-regulator pairs with high mutual algorithmic information exponentially more probable.

Conclusion: The study provides an AIT-based perspective corroborating the Internal Model Principle, showing that optimal regulators inherently embed a model of the system, and extending its insights to distribution-free contexts and individual sequences.

Abstract: The regulator theorem states that, under certain conditions, any optimal
controller must embody a model of the system it regulates, grounding the idea
that controllers embed, explicitly or implicitly, internal models of the
controlled. This principle underpins neuroscience and predictive brain theories
like the Free-Energy Principle or Kolmogorov/Algorithmic Agent theory. However,
the theorem is only proven in limited settings. Here, we treat the
deterministic, closed, coupled world-regulator system $(W,R)$ as a single
self-delimiting program $p$ via a constant-size wrapper that produces the world
output string~$x$ fed to the regulator. We analyze regulation from the
viewpoint of the algorithmic complexity of the output, $K(x)$. We define $R$ to
be a \emph{good algorithmic regulator} if it \emph{reduces} the algorithmic
complexity of the readout relative to a null (unregulated) baseline
$\varnothing$, i.e., \[ \Delta = K\big(O_{W,\varnothing}\big) -
K\big(O_{W,R}\big) > 0. \] We then prove that the larger $\Delta$ is, the more
world-regulator pairs with high mutual algorithmic information are favored.
More precisely, a complexity gap $\Delta > 0$ yields \[ \Pr\big((W,R)\mid
x\big) \le C\,2^{\,M(W{:}R)}\,2^{-\Delta}, \] making low $M(W{:}R)$
exponentially unlikely as $\Delta$ grows. This is an AIT version of the idea
that ``the regulator contains a model of the world.'' The framework is
distribution-free, applies to individual sequences, and complements the
Internal Model Principle. Beyond this necessity claim, the same coding-theorem
calculus singles out a \emph{canonical scalar objective} and implicates a
\emph{planner}. On the realized episode, a regulator behaves \emph{as if} it
minimized the conditional description length of the readout.

Motivation: To establish a connection between abstract mathematical theorems and their practical implications in understanding the relationship between distinguishing and expressive powers across various disciplines.

*Han Cui,Jingbo Liu*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper addresses bias in posterior sampling when using empirical distributions from training data, proposing a debiasing scheme to improve accuracy using a black-box approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the issue of bias caused by using empirical distributions for posterior sampling, where the nonlinearity in the sampling process leads to inaccuracies.

Method: The authors introduce a black-box debiasing algorithm that generates samples and weights as a $k$-th order approximation to correct sampling errors, treating the sampling method as a black-box.

Result: The proposed scheme achieves higher accuracy in posterior sampling by correcting biases in generative modeling, without increasing variance.

Conclusion: The approach improves accuracy in conditional sampling, balancing better memorization and generalization for Bayesian and generative modeling tasks.

Abstract: Conditional sampling is a fundamental task in Bayesian statistics and
generative modeling. Consider the problem of sampling from the posterior
distribution $P_{X|Y=y^*}$ for some observation $y^*$, where the likelihood
$P_{Y|X}$ is known, and we are given $n$ i.i.d. samples $D=\{X_i\}_{i=1}^n$
drawn from an unknown prior distribution $\pi_X$. Suppose that
$f(\hat{\pi}_{X^n})$ is the distribution of a posterior sample generated by an
algorithm (e.g. a conditional generative model or the Bayes rule) when
$\hat{\pi}_{X^n}$ is the empirical distribution of the training data. Although
averaging over the randomness of the training data $D$, we have
$\mathbb{E}_D\left(\hat{\pi}_{X^n}\right)= \pi_X$, we do not have
$\mathbb{E}_D\left\{f(\hat{\pi}_{X^n})\right\}= f(\pi_X)$ due to the
nonlinearity of $f$, leading to a bias. In this paper we propose a black-box
debiasing scheme that improves the accuracy of such a naive plug-in approach.
For any integer $k$ and under boundedness of the likelihood and smoothness of
$f$, we generate samples $\hat{X}^{(1)},\dots,\hat{X}^{(k)}$ and weights
$w_1,\dots,w_k$ such that $\sum_{i=1}^kw_iP_{\hat{X}^{(i)}}$ is a $k$-th order
approximation of $f(\pi_X)$, where the generation process treats $f$ as a
black-box. Our generation process achieves higher accuracy when averaged over
the randomness of the training data, without degrading the variance, which can
be interpreted as improving memorization without compromising generalization in
generative models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current lens design relies heavily on human expertise due to its non-convex optimization challenges, leading to inefficiency and limited diversity.

Method: OptiNeuro employs a two-step process: generating diverse initial lens designs and progressively eliminating low-performing candidates while refining viable options using gradient-based optimization.

Result: OptiNeuro achieves automated design of complex aspheric imaging lenses, reaching quasi-human-level performance with minimal human intervention.

Conclusion: OptiNeuro advances lens design by improving automation, efficiency, and enabling discovery of novel architectures.

Abstract: The highly non-convex optimization landscape of modern lens design
necessitates extensive human expertise, resulting in inefficiency and
constrained design diversity. While automated methods are desirable, existing
approaches remain limited to simple tasks or produce complex lenses with
suboptimal image quality. Drawing inspiration from the synaptic pruning
mechanism in mammalian neural development, this study proposes OptiNeuro--a
novel automated lens design framework that first generates diverse initial
structures and then progressively eliminates low-performance lenses while
refining remaining candidates through gradient-based optimization. By fully
automating the design of complex aspheric imaging lenses, OptiNeuro
demonstrates quasi-human-level performance, identifying multiple viable

the automation level and efficiency of lens design but also facilitates the
exploration of previously uncharted lens architectures.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an end-to-end solution for robust imaging using ultra-thin metalens cameras, overcoming practical limitations like chromatic aberration with a specialized restoration framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Metalenses promise significant reductions in camera size and weight, but practical adoption is limited due to imaging issues such as chromatic aberration and light inefficiency.

Method: A lightweight convolutional network coupled with a memory-efficient burst fusion algorithm corrects metalens-induced distortions in real-world captures.

Result: Experiments show the proposed method outperforms existing restoration techniques on handheld, real-world imaging scenarios.

Conclusion: The solution provides a practical route for deploying metalens-based cameras in everyday applications, resolving existing challenges using advanced imaging restoration techniques.

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of robust, in-the-wild imaging using ultra-thin
nanophotonic metalens cameras. Meta-lenses, composed of planar arrays of
nanoscale scatterers, promise dramatic reductions in size and weight compared
to conventional refractive optics. However, severe chromatic aberration,
pronounced light scattering, narrow spectral bandwidth, and low light
efficiency continue to limit their practical adoption. In this work, we present
an end-to-end solution for in-the-wild imaging that pairs a metalens several
times thinner than conventional optics with a bespoke multi-image restoration
framework optimized for practical metalens cameras. Our method centers on a
lightweight convolutional network paired with a memory-efficient burst fusion
algorithm that adaptively corrects noise, saturation clipping, and lens-induced
distortions across rapid sequences of extremely degraded metalens captures.
Extensive experiments on diverse, real-world handheld captures demonstrate that
our approach consistently outperforms existing burst-mode and single-image
restoration techniques.These results point toward a practical route for
deploying metalens-based cameras in everyday imaging applications.

*Ehsan Saleh,Saba Ghaffari,Jeffrey H. Curtis,Lekha Patel,Peter A. Bosler,Nicole Riemer,Matthew West*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework utilizing deep variational autoencoder (VAE) models to develop compact, physically meaningful representations of aerosol properties, valuable for addressing uncertainties in aerosol-cloud-radiation interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aerosol-cloud-radiation interactions are highly uncertain due to the complexity of aerosol state representations and challenges in gathering complete measurements. The paper aims to distill these complex properties into simpler forms for better understanding and application.

Method: The authors use VAE models to compress high-dimensional aerosol data into ten latent variables. They introduce a preprocessing optimization to improve robustness and accuracy of reconstructions and propose a realism metric based on sliced Wasserstein distance for optimization.

Result: The VAE approach effectively preserved key diagnostics such as CCN spectra, optical coefficients, and ice nucleation properties. Additionally, preprocessing optimization boosted accuracy despite input noise, and a novel realism metric enhanced model performance.

Conclusion: The framework facilitates compact, robust, and meaningful representations of aerosol states, paving the way for improved analysis and scalability in climate applications.

Abstract: Aerosol-cloud--radiation interactions remain among the most uncertain
components of the Earth's climate system, in partdue to the high dimensionality
of aerosol state representations and the difficulty of obtaining complete
\textit{in situ} measurements. Addressing these challenges requires methods
that distill complex aerosol properties into compact yet physically meaningful
forms. Generative autoencoder models provide such a pathway. We present a
framework for learning deep variational autoencoder (VAE) models of speciated
mass and number concentration distributions, which capture detailed aerosol
size-composition characteristics. By compressing hundreds of original
dimensions into ten latent variables, the approach enables efficient storage
and processing while preserving the fidelity of key diagnostics, including
cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) spectra, optical scattering and absorption
coefficients, and ice nucleation properties. Results show that CCN spectra are
easiest to reconstruct accurately, optical properties are moderately difficult,
and ice nucleation properties are the most challenging. To improve performance,
we introduce a preprocessing optimization strategy that avoids repeated
retraining and yields latent representations resilient to high-magnitude
Gaussian noise, boosting accuracy for CCN spectra, optical coefficients, and
frozen fraction spectra. Finally, we propose a novel realism metric -- based on
the sliced Wasserstein distance between generated samples and a held-out test
set -- for optimizing the KL divergence weight in VAEs. Together, these
contributions enable compact, robust, and physically meaningful representations
of aerosol states for large-scale climate applications.

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces Smart NINT, a machine learning-enhanced approach to simulate interactive emissions in Earth System Models, improving efficiency while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interactive composition simulations in Earth System Models are computationally expensive and hinder higher-resolution transient climate simulations. The paper aims to address this limitation by offering a computationally efficient method for modeling real-time feedback between aerosols and climate processes.

Method: The authors extended NASA's GISS-ModelE3 system by incorporating machine learning to develop Smart NINT, which avoids physics parameterizations and emulates interactive emissions using surface emissions and meteorological data as inputs. A spatiotemporal architecture is used to capture dependencies in tracer evolution.

Result: Smart NINT achieved high model performance, with R-squared values of 0.92 and Pearson-r of 0.96 at lower pressure levels, maintaining acceptable accuracy even for data outside the training domain, hinting at robust generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: Smart NINT offers a promising ML-based solution for reducing computational costs in ESM simulations while effectively capturing aerosol-climate interactions, paving the way for improved long-term climate projections.

Abstract: Interactive composition simulations in Earth System Models (ESMs) are
computationally expensive as they transport numerous gaseous and aerosol
tracers at each timestep. This limits higher-resolution transient climate
simulations with current computational resources. ESMs like NASA GISS-ModelE3
(ModelE) often use pre-computed monthly-averaged atmospheric composition
concentrations (Non-Interactive Tracers or NINT) to reduce computational costs.
While NINT significantly cuts computations, it fails to capture real-time
feedback between aerosols and other climate processes by relying on
pre-calculated fields. We extended the ModelE NINT version using machine
learning (ML) to create Smart NINT, which emulates interactive emissions. Smart
NINT interactively calculates concentrations using ML with surface emissions
and meteorological data as inputs, avoiding full physics parameterizations. Our
approach utilizes a spatiotemporal architecture that possesses a well-matched
inductive bias to effectively capture the spatial and temporal dependencies in
tracer evolution. Input data processed through the first 20 vertical levels
(from the surface up to 656 hPa) using the ModelE OMA scheme. This vertical
range covers nearly the entire BCB concentration distribution in the
troposphere, where significant variation on short time horizons due to
surface-level emissions is observed. Our evaluation shows excellent model
performance with R-squared values of 0.92 and Pearson-r of 0.96 at the first
pressure level. This high performance continues through level 15 (808.5 hPa),
then gradually decreases as BCB concentrations drop significantly. The model
maintains acceptable performance even when tested on data from entirely
different periods outside the training domain, which is a crucial capability
for climate modeling applications requiring reliable long-term projections.

Motivation: The increasing presence of satellite mega-constellations in LEO necessitates accurate and accessible orbital data to ensure spacecraft safety and maintain the orbital environment.

Method: The study utilized two months of orbital data from ~1500 Starlink satellites, employing high-precision numerical propagation and Physics-Informed Machine Learning to extract relevant satellite properties. It compared positional errors between deorbiting/non-deorbiting satellites and analyzed discrepancies in published ephemerides.

Result: The findings showed positional Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 300 m for non-deorbiting satellites and 600 m for deorbiting satellites. Discrepancies were identified due to simplified dynamics, planned maneuvers, and limitations in uncertainty propagation.

Conclusion: Publicly available satellite data has notable limitations for robust Space Situational Awareness (SSA). A data-driven satellite decay model for mega-constellations is proposed to help address these shortcomings.

Abstract: In the era of mega-constellations, the need for accurate and publicly
available information has become fundamental for satellite operators to
guarantee the safety of spacecrafts and the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) space
environment. This study critically evaluates the accuracy and reliability of
publicly available ephemeris data for a LEO mega-constellation - Starlink. The
goal of this work is twofold: (i) compare and analyze the quality of the data
against high-precision numerical propagation. (ii) Leverage Physics-Informed
Machine Learning to extract relevant satellite quantities, such as
non-conservative forces, during the decay process. By analyzing two months of
real orbital data for approximately 1500 Starlink satellites, we identify
discrepancies between high precision numerical algorithms and the published
ephemerides, recognizing the use of simplified dynamics at fixed thresholds,
planned maneuvers, and limitations in uncertainty propagations. Furthermore, we
compare data obtained from multiple sources to track and analyze deorbiting
satellites over the same period. Empirically, we extract the acceleration
profile of satellites during deorbiting and provide insights relating to the
effects of non-conservative forces during reentry. For non-deorbiting
satellites, the position Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was approximately 300 m,
while for deorbiting satellites it increased to about 600 m. Through this
in-depth analysis, we highlight potential limitations in publicly available
data for accurate and robust Space Situational Awareness (SSA), and
importantly, we propose a data-driven model of satellite decay in
mega-constellations.

### [982] [Scaling Properties of Avalanche Activity in the Two-Dimensional Abelian Sandpile Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09631)
*Anubhav Ganguly*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: This study analyzes site activity distribution in a 2D Abelian sandpile model, revealing scaling behaviors that distinguish typical and highly excitable sites.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to better understand the characteristics of local avalanche activity in the Abelian sandpile model, leveraging site activity distribution to complement traditional avalanche size statistics.

Method: Numerical simulations were performed on system sizes up to L=160, averaging over 10,000 configurations. The study examines the probability distribution of site activities and identifies finite-size scaling forms and distribution behaviors.

Result: The site activity distribution follows a finite-size scaling form, with a small activity regime scaling as A^-1/2 and a large activity regime exhibiting exponential decay. A crossover activity threshold (A* ~ 0.1 L^2) separates the two regimes.

Conclusion: The findings enhance understanding of local activity in critical dynamics, offering insights relevant to real-world systems exhibiting self-organized critical behavior.

Abstract: We study the scaling properties of avalanche activity in the two-dimensional
Abelian sandpile model. Instead of the conventional avalanche size
distribution, we analyze the site activity distribution, which measures how
often a site participates in avalanches when grains are added across the
lattice. Using numerical simulations for system sizes up to \(L = 160\),
averaged over \(10^4\) configurations, we determine the probability
distribution \(P(A, L)\) of site activities. The results show that \(P(A, L)\)
follows a finite-size scaling form \[ P(A, L) \sim L^{-2}
F\Big(\frac{A}{L^2}\Big). \] For small values \(A \ll L^2\) the scaling
function behaves as \[ F(u) \sim u^{-1/2}, \quad \text{corresponding to} \quad
P(A) \sim \frac{1}{L}, \] while for large activities \(A \sim O(L^2)\) the
distribution decays as \[ F(u) \sim \exp\big(-c_3 u - c_4 u^2\big). \] The
crossover between these two regimes occurs at \[ A^* \sim 0.1 \, L^2, \]
marking the threshold between typical and highly excitable sites. This
characterization of local avalanche activity provides complementary information
to the usual avalanche size statistics, highlighting how local regions serve as
frequent conduits for critical dynamics. These results may help connect
sandpile models to real-world self-organized critical systems where only
partial local activity can be observed.

### [983] [Distributed clustering in partially overlapping feature spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09799)
*Alessio Maritan,Luca Schenato*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: This paper tackles a distributed clustering problem where data features are dispersed across private datasets and proposes two algorithms for collaborative clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world applications (e.g., healthcare) often face feature space heterogeneity, where different entities possess complementary data, necessitating effective distributed clustering solutions.

Method: Two algorithms are introduced: a federated algorithm for collaborative centroid updates and a one-shot algorithm that uses statistical parametrization and synthetic dataset merging, with local clustering determined independently by participants.

Result: The paper theoretically identifies scenarios for convergence to a centralized solution and evaluates the algorithms' performance on three public datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed methods provide flexible, efficient solutions for distributed clustering with feature space heterogeneity.

Abstract: We introduce and address a novel distributed clustering problem where each
participant has a private dataset containing only a subset of all available
features, and some features are included in multiple datasets. This scenario
occurs in many real-world applications, such as in healthcare, where different
institutions have complementary data on similar patients. We propose two
different algorithms suitable for solving distributed clustering problems that
exhibit this type of feature space heterogeneity. The first is a federated
algorithm in which participants collaboratively update a set of global
centroids. The second is a one-shot algorithm in which participants share a
statistical parametrization of their local clusters with the central server,
who generates and merges synthetic proxy datasets. In both cases, participants
perform local clustering using algorithms of their choice, which provides
flexibility and personalized computational costs. Pretending that local
datasets result from splitting and masking an initial centralized dataset, we
identify some conditions under which the proposed algorithms are expected to
converge to the optimal centralized solution. Finally, we test the practical
performance of the algorithms on three public datasets.

### [984] [Information-Computation Tradeoffs for Noiseless Linear Regression with Oblivious Contamination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10665)
*Ilias Diakonikolas,Chao Gao,Daniel M. Kane,John Lafferty,Ankit Pensia*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: This paper investigates noiseless linear regression with Gaussian covariates and additive oblivious contamination, providing insights into the sample complexity of efficient algorithms for robust regression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand the inherent trade-offs between efficiency and sample complexity when solving a robust linear regression problem with additive oblivious contamination.

Method: The paper leverages the Statistical Query (SQ) model to formally analyze and derive lower bounds for the sample complexity required by efficient algorithms to solve the given regression task.

Result: It establishes that efficient algorithms inherently require a quadratic dependence on $1/\alpha$ in their sample complexity, specifically showing a VSTAT complexity lower bound of $\tilde{\Omega}(d^{1/2}/\alpha^2)$.

Conclusion: The findings provide formal evidence for the fundamental limitations on the sample complexity of efficient algorithms for this robust linear regression problem.

Abstract: We study the task of noiseless linear regression under Gaussian covariates in
the presence of additive oblivious contamination. Specifically, we are given
i.i.d.\ samples from a distribution $(x, y)$ on $\mathbb{R}^d \times
\mathbb{R}$ with $x \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\mathbf{I}_d)$ and $y = x^\top \beta +
z$, where $z$ is drawn independently of $x$ from an unknown distribution $E$.
Moreover, $z$ satisfies $\mathbb{P}_E[z = 0] = \alpha>0$. The goal is to
accurately recover the regressor $\beta$ to small $\ell_2$-error. Ignoring
computational considerations, this problem is known to be solvable using
$O(d/\alpha)$ samples. On the other hand, the best known polynomial-time
algorithms require $\Omega(d/\alpha^2)$ samples. Here we provide formal
evidence that the quadratic dependence in $1/\alpha$ is inherent for efficient
algorithms. Specifically, we show that any efficient Statistical Query
algorithm for this task requires VSTAT complexity at least
$\tilde{\Omega}(d^{1/2}/\alpha^2)$.

### [985] [Learning-Augmented Streaming Algorithms for Correlation Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10705)
*Yinhao Dong,Shan Jiang,Shi Li,Pan Peng*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: This paper presents the first learning-augmented streaming algorithms for Correlation Clustering, improving space and approximation trade-offs for both complete and general graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of minimizing disagreements in Correlation Clustering within a streaming setting, focusing on improving the trade-off between space usage and approximation quality.

Method: The algorithms utilize predictions of pairwise distances between vertices provided by a predictor, building upon previous works and focusing on complete and general graphs.

Result: For complete graphs, the algorithm achieves better-than-3 approximation with improved space efficiency. For general graphs, it achieves O(log |E^-|) approximation with better space trade-offs than previous non-learning algorithms.

Conclusion: The proposed learning-augmented algorithms are more space-efficient and achieve better approximation under good prediction quality, as demonstrated through experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: We study streaming algorithms for Correlation Clustering. Given a graph as an
arbitrary-order stream of edges, with each edge labeled as positive or
negative, the goal is to partition the vertices into disjoint clusters, such
that the number of disagreements is minimized. In this paper, we give the first
learning-augmented streaming algorithms for the problem on both complete and
general graphs, improving the best-known space-approximation tradeoffs. Based
on the works of Cambus et al. (SODA'24) and Ahn et al. (ICML'15), our
algorithms use the predictions of pairwise distances between vertices provided
by a predictor. For complete graphs, our algorithm achieves a better-than-$3$
approximation under good prediction quality, while using $\tilde{O}(n)$ total
space. For general graphs, our algorithm achieves an $O(\log |E^-|)$
approximation under good prediction quality using $\tilde{O}(n)$ total space,
improving the best-known non-learning algorithm in terms of space efficiency.
Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the
superiority of our proposed algorithms over their non-learning counterparts.

### [986] [Continual Release of Densest Subgraphs: Privacy Amplification & Sublinear Space via Subsampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11640)
*Felix Zhou*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: This paper introduces a sublinear-space, continual-release edge-differentially private algorithm for the densest subgraph problem, improving accuracy and space efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the absence of efficient edge-differentially private algorithms for graph problems in streaming settings, especially for DSG, with better accuracy and reduced space complexity.

Method: The authors use subsampling for privacy amplification and sparsification, propose graph densification for earlier subsampling, and employ a reduction to static algorithms.

Result: The continual-release DSG algorithm achieves $O(\log n)$ additive error and $O(n\log n)$ space, providing improvements over previous methods.

Conclusion: The paper advances private graph algorithms by connecting subsampling with privacy and sparsification, offering enhancements in both error and space complexity.

Abstract: We study the sublinear space continual release model for edge-differentially
private (DP) graph algorithms, with a focus on the densest subgraph problem
(DSG) in the insertion-only setting. Our main result is the first continual
release DSG algorithm that matches the additive error of the best static DP
algorithms and the space complexity of the best non-private streaming
algorithms, up to constants. The key idea is a refined use of subsampling that
simultaneously achieves privacy amplification and sparsification, a connection
not previously formalized in graph DP. Via a simple black-box reduction to the
static setting, we obtain both pure and approximate-DP algorithms with $O(\log
n)$ additive error and $O(n\log n)$ space, improving both accuracy and space
complexity over the previous state of the art. Along the way, we introduce
graph densification in the graph DP setting, adding edges to trigger earlier
subsampling, which removes the extra logarithmic factors in error and space
incurred by prior work [ELMZ25]. We believe this simple idea may be of
independent interest.

*Sadra Saremi,Amirhossein Ahmadkhan Kordbacheh*

Main category: physics.plasm-ph

TL;DR: A machine-learning-assisted 3D fluid-PIC hybrid model for simulating high-intensity laser plasma interactions that adapts based on stability, achieving high accuracy and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-intensity laser plasma interactions require coupling fluid and kinetic regimes without compromising on both physical accuracy and computational efficiency.

Method: Introduces a hybrid model incorporating a machine-learning component (SwitchNet), which transitions between fluid and PIC solvers based on stability. Uses synthetic training data, physics-based loss functions, and uncertainty evaluation through Monte Carlo dropout.

Result: Achieves R^2 > 0.95 and MSE < 10^-4 for field predictions, accurately reproducing plasma behavior with adaptive solver applications.

Conclusion: The model successfully enhances the scalability and precision of laser-plasma interaction simulations, creating a framework applicable to high-energy-density and particle acceleration research.

Abstract: High-intensity laser plasma interactions create complex computational
problems because they involve both fluid and kinetic regimes, which need models
that maintain physical precision while keeping computational speed. The
research introduces a machine learning-based three-dimensional hybrid
fluid-particle-in-cell (PIC) system, which links relativistic plasma behavior
to automatic regime transitions. The technique employs fluid approximations for
stable areas but activates the PIC solver when SwitchNet directs it to unstable
sections through its training on physics-based synthetic data. The model uses a
smooth transition between Ammosov-Delone-Krainov (ADK) tunneling and
multiphoton ionization rates to simulate ionization, while Airy-function
approximations simulate quantum electrodynamic (QED) effects for radiation
reaction and pair production. The convolutional neural network applies energy
conservation through physics-based loss functions, which operate on normalized
fields per channel. Monte Carlo dropout provides uncertainty measurement. The
hybrid model produces precise predictions with coefficient of determination
(R^2) values above 0.95 and mean squared errors below 10^-4 for all field
components. This adaptive approach enhances the accuracy and scalability of
laser-plasma simulations, providing a unified predictive framework for
high-energy-density and particle acceleration applications.

*Seong-Joon Park,Hee-Youl Kwak,Yongjune Kim*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Hierarchical Qubit-Merging Transformer (HQMT), an advanced neural network-based decoding framework for quantum error correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the critical need for effective quantum error correction schemes in large-scale quantum computation by utilizing neural network advancements.

Method: The HQMT framework leverages the structural graph of stabilizer codes, using a hierarchical approach with local attention and qubit-merging layers to capture error correlations across scales.

Result: The HQMT achieves significantly lower logical error rates for surface codes, outperforming existing neural network-based and belief propagation-based decoders.

Conclusion: HQMT provides a scalable and effective solution for surface code decoding, enhancing the reliability of quantum computing.

Abstract: For reliable large-scale quantum computation, a quantum error correction
(QEC) scheme must effectively resolve physical errors to protect logical
information. Leveraging recent advances in deep learning, neural network-based
decoders have emerged as a promising approach to enhance the reliability of
QEC. We propose the Hierarchical Qubit-Merging Transformer (HQMT), a novel and
general decoding framework that explicitly leverages the structural graph of
stabilizer codes to learn error correlations across multiple scales. Our
architecture first computes attention locally on structurally related groups of
stabilizers and then systematically merges these qubit-centric representations
to build a global view of the error syndrome. The proposed HQMT achieves
substantially lower logical error rates for surface codes by integrating a
dedicated qubit-merging layer within the transformer architecture. Across
various code distances, HQMT significantly outperforms previous neural
network-based QEC decoders as well as a powerful belief propagation with
ordered statistics decoding (BP+OSD) baseline. This hierarchical approach
provides a scalable and effective framework for surface code decoding,
advancing the realization of reliable quantum computing.

Conclusion: Vibe coding significantly democratizes software development by enabling domain experts to prototype advanced analytical tools quickly and cost-effectively, revolutionizing computational biology software creation.

Abstract: Building custom data analysis platforms traditionally requires extensive
software engineering expertise, limiting accessibility for many researchers.
Here, I demonstrate that modern large language models (LLMs) and autonomous
coding agents can dramatically lower this barrier through a process called
'vibe coding', an iterative, conversational style of software creation where
users describe goals in natural language and AI agents generate, test, and
refine executable code in real-time. As a proof of concept, I used Vibe coding
to create a fully functional proteomics data analysis website capable of
performing standard tasks, including data normalization, differential
expression testing, and volcano plot visualization. The entire application,
including user interface, backend logic, and data upload pipeline, was
developed in less than ten minutes using only four natural-language prompts,
without any manual coding, at a cost of under $2. Previous works in this area
typically require tens of thousands of dollars in research effort from highly
trained programmers. I detail the step-by-step generation process and evaluate
the resulting code's functionality. This demonstration highlights how vibe
coding enables domain experts to rapidly prototype sophisticated analytical
tools, transforming the pace and accessibility of computational biology
software development.
