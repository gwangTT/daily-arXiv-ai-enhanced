### [1] [Truncated Proximal Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15050)
*Tiantian Fan,Lingjun Liu,Yu Yue,Jiaze Chen,Chengyi Wang,Qiying Yu,Chi Zhang,Zhiqi Lin,Ruofei Zhu,Yufeng Yuan,Xiaochen Zuo,Bole Ma,Mofan Zhang,Gaohong Liu,Ru Zhang,Haotian Zhou,Cong Xie,Ruidong Zhu,Zhi Zhang,Xin Liu,Mingxuan Wang,Lin Yan,Yonghui Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Truncated Proximal Policy Optimization (T-PPO), which accelerates training for large language models (LLMs) while preserving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning methods like PPO are effective for reasoning models but are inefficient with long response generations, leading to wasted computational resources and slow training.

Method: The paper proposes T-PPO, which incorporates Extended Generalized Advantage Estimation (EGAE) for incomplete response-based learning and optimizations for independent training of policy and value models.

Result: Experimental results using a 32B model on AIME 2024 reveal that T-PPO enhances training efficiency by up to 2.5x while surpassing existing methods in performance.

Conclusion: T-PPO demonstrates that truncating response generation and optimizing computation workloads significantly boost the training efficiency and retain strong convergence performance for reasoning-capable LLMs.

Abstract: Recently, test-time scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
exceptional reasoning capabilities across scientific and professional tasks by
generating long chains-of-thought (CoT). As a crucial component for developing
these reasoning models, reinforcement learning (RL), exemplified by Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO) and its variants, allows models to learn through
trial and error. However, PPO can be time-consuming due to its inherent
on-policy nature, which is further exacerbated by increasing response lengths.
In this work, we propose Truncated Proximal Policy Optimization (T-PPO), a
novel extension to PPO that improves training efficiency by streamlining policy
update and length-restricted response generation. T-PPO mitigates the issue of
low hardware utilization, an inherent drawback of fully synchronized
long-generation procedures, where resources often sit idle during the waiting
periods for complete rollouts. Our contributions are two-folds. First, we
propose Extended Generalized Advantage Estimation (EGAE) for advantage
estimation derived from incomplete responses while maintaining the integrity of
policy learning. Second, we devise a computationally optimized mechanism that
allows for the independent optimization of the policy and value models. By
selectively filtering prompt and truncated tokens, this mechanism reduces
redundant computations and accelerates the training process without sacrificing
convergence performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficacy of T-PPO
on AIME 2024 with a 32B base model. The experimental results show that T-PPO
improves the training efficiency of reasoning LLMs by up to 2.5x and
outperforms its existing competitors.

### [2] [HeurAgenix: Leveraging LLMs for Solving Complex Combinatorial Optimization Challenges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15196)
*Xianliang Yang,Ling Zhang,Haolong Qian,Lei Song,Jiang Bian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HeurAgenix is a framework combining large language models (LLMs) to evolve and select heuristics for solving combinatorial optimization problems, outperforming existing approaches and equaling specialized solvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional heuristic algorithms require manual expertise and lack generalizability for diverse optimization instances, creating a need for automated and robust heuristic development.

Method: HeurAgenix employs a two-stage approach: heuristic evolution using LLMs to generate reusable strategies, and heuristic selection using either advanced or lightweight LLMs fine-tuned with a dual-reward mechanism to ensure accurate decisions despite noisy data.

Result: The framework effectively outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based hyper-heuristics and achieves comparable or superior results to specialized optimization solvers in experiments.

Conclusion: HeurAgenix demonstrates the potential of LLMs for automated and flexible heuristic optimization, offering a scalable solution beyond manual and traditional methods.

Abstract: Heuristic algorithms play a vital role in solving combinatorial optimization
(CO) problems, yet traditional designs depend heavily on manual expertise and
struggle to generalize across diverse instances. We introduce
\textbf{HeurAgenix}, a two-stage hyper-heuristic framework powered by large
language models (LLMs) that first evolves heuristics and then selects among
them automatically. In the heuristic evolution phase, HeurAgenix leverages an
LLM to compare seed heuristic solutions with higher-quality solutions and
extract reusable evolution strategies. During problem solving, it dynamically
picks the most promising heuristic for each problem state, guided by the LLM's
perception ability. For flexibility, this selector can be either a
state-of-the-art LLM or a fine-tuned lightweight model with lower inference
cost. To mitigate the scarcity of reliable supervision caused by CO complexity,
we fine-tune the lightweight heuristic selector with a dual-reward mechanism
that jointly exploits singals from selection preferences and state perception,
enabling robust selection under noisy annotations. Extensive experiments on
canonical benchmarks show that HeurAgenix not only outperforms existing
LLM-based hyper-heuristics but also matches or exceeds specialized solvers.

### [3] [Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Multi-Satellite Earth Observation: A Realistic Case Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15207)
*Mohamad A. Hady,Siyi Hu,Mahardhika Pratama,Jimmy Cao,Ryszard Kowalczyk*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) for enhancing autonomous mission planning in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites, tackling challenges like coordination, resource limitations, and observation uncertainties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional optimization techniques struggle with real-time decision-making in dynamic Earth Observation (EO) missions, necessitating the exploration of RL and MARL for handling the complexities of autonomous multi-satellite coordination.

Method: The study implements RL and MARL frameworks, specifically employing algorithms such as PPO, IPPO, MAPPO, and HAPPO, using a near-realistic satellite simulation environment to evaluate their performance and training stability.

Result: The study finds that MARL algorithms can effectively manage the trade-offs between imaging objectives and resource constraints while addressing the challenges of non-stationarity and reward interdependence in multi-satellite coordination.

Conclusion: This research demonstrates the potential of MARL in advancing autonomous satellite operations and offers practical insights for improving policy learning in decentralized EO missions.

Abstract: The exponential growth of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites has revolutionised
Earth Observation (EO) missions, addressing challenges in climate monitoring,
disaster management, and more. However, autonomous coordination in
multi-satellite systems remains a fundamental challenge. Traditional
optimisation approaches struggle to handle the real-time decision-making
demands of dynamic EO missions, necessitating the use of Reinforcement Learning
(RL) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). In this paper, we
investigate RL-based autonomous EO mission planning by modelling
single-satellite operations and extending to multi-satellite constellations
using MARL frameworks. We address key challenges, including energy and data
storage limitations, uncertainties in satellite observations, and the
complexities of decentralised coordination under partial observability. By
leveraging a near-realistic satellite simulation environment, we evaluate the
training stability and performance of state-of-the-art MARL algorithms,
including PPO, IPPO, MAPPO, and HAPPO. Our results demonstrate that MARL can
effectively balance imaging and resource management while addressing
non-stationarity and reward interdependency in multi-satellite coordination.
The insights gained from this study provide a foundation for autonomous
satellite operations, offering practical guidelines for improving policy
learning in decentralised EO missions.

### [4] [Joint Computation Offloading and Resource Allocation for Uncertain Maritime MEC via Cooperation of UAVs and Vessels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15225)
*Jiahao You,Ziye Jia,Chao Dong,Qihui Wu,Zhu Han*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a cooperative MEC framework using UAVs and vessels to address uncertain maritime task computation demands through efficient offloading, resource allocation, and optimization techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapidly increasing computational demands of the maritime Internet of Things (MIoT) and the challenges posed by uncertain maritime tasks necessitate efficient solutions for computation offloading and resource allocation in MIoT networks.

Method: The authors propose a cooperative MEC framework that combines UAVs and vessels for computation offloading and resource allocation. They use Lyapunov optimization to handle uncertainty in tasks and convert long-term constraints into short-term ones. A Markov game model is formulated, and a heterogeneous-agent soft actor-critic method is developed to solve the optimization problem.

Result: The proposed approach effectively minimizes total execution time and successfully addresses computational offloading and resource allocation challenges in MIoT, as validated by simulations.

Conclusion: The cooperative MEC framework and proposed optimization methods provide an effective solution for addressing uncertain maritime computational tasks, showcasing promising improvements in computation offloading and resource allocation for MIoT networks.

Abstract: The computation demands from the maritime Internet of Things (MIoT) increase
rapidly in recent years, and the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and vessels
based multi-access edge computing (MEC) can fulfill these MIoT requirements.
However, the uncertain maritime tasks present significant challenges of
inefficient computation offloading and resource allocation. In this paper, we
focus on the maritime computation offloading and resource allocation through
the cooperation of UAVs and vessels, with consideration of uncertain tasks.
Specifically, we propose a cooperative MEC framework for computation offloading
and resource allocation, including MIoT devices, UAVs and vessels. Then, we
formulate the optimization problem to minimize the total execution time. As for
the uncertain MIoT tasks, we leverage Lyapunov optimization to tackle the
unpredictable task arrivals and varying computational resource availability. By
converting the long-term constraints into short-term constraints, we obtain a
set of small-scale optimization problems. Further, considering the
heterogeneity of actions and resources of UAVs and vessels, we reformulate the
small-scale optimization problem into a Markov game (MG). Moreover, a
heterogeneous-agent soft actor-critic is proposed to sequentially update
various neural networks and effectively solve the MG problem. Finally,
simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness in addressing
computational offloading and resource allocation.

### [5] [Efficient and Generalizable Environmental Understanding for Visual Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15377)
*Ruoyu Wang,Xinshu Li,Chen Wang,Lina Yao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Causality-Aware Navigation (CAN), which uses causality principles to improve visual navigation in Embodied AI. Integrating a Causal Understanding Module, CAN surpasses existing methods in various navigation tasks and simulation environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual navigation methods process all historical data simultaneously, neglecting internal associations within sequential data, potentially limiting task performance.

Method: The authors propose Causality-Aware Navigation (CAN), which integrates a Causal Understanding Module to enhance environmental understanding by addressing limitations in conventional sequential methods.

Result: Empirical evaluations demonstrate superior performance of CAN compared to baselines in diverse tasks and environments. Ablation studies show the module generalizes well under both Reinforcement and Supervised Learning settings.

Conclusion: Causality-Aware Navigation (CAN), by leveraging causality principles, effectively improves task performance in visual navigation tasks without adding computational overhead.

Abstract: Visual Navigation is a core task in Embodied AI, enabling agents to navigate
complex environments toward given objectives. Across diverse settings within
Navigation tasks, many necessitate the modelling of sequential data accumulated
from preceding time steps. While existing methods perform well, they typically
process all historical observations simultaneously, overlooking the internal
association structure within the data, which may limit the potential for
further improvements in task performance. We address this by examining the
unique characteristics of Navigation tasks through the lens of causality,
introducing a causal framework to highlight the limitations of conventional
sequential methods. Leveraging this insight, we propose Causality-Aware
Navigation (CAN), which incorporates a Causal Understanding Module to enhance
the agent's environmental understanding capability. Empirical evaluations show
that our approach consistently outperforms baselines across various tasks and
simulation environments. Extensive ablations studies attribute these gains to
the Causal Understanding Module, which generalizes effectively in both
Reinforcement and Supervised Learning settings without computational overhead.

### [6] [Managing Complex Failure Analysis Workflows with LLM-based Reasoning and Acting Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15567)
*Aline Dobrovsky,Konstantin Schekotihin,Christian Burmer*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Large Language Model-based Planning Agent (LPA) to assist engineers in Failure Analysis (FA) processes, integrating AI for workflow automation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the efficiency of Failure Analysis processes by automating tasks and integrating multiple AI components into effective workflows.

Method: The authors developed an LPA that utilizes Large Language Models combined with advanced planning capabilities and external tool interfaces for autonomous decision-making and task execution.

Result: The evaluation revealed the LPA to be operationally effective and reliable in automating and supporting various FA workflows.

Conclusion: The LPA successfully aids engineers in FA by streamlining processes and demonstrating the potential for enhanced automation and integration in the field.

Abstract: Failure Analysis (FA) is a highly intricate and knowledge-intensive process.
The integration of AI components within the computational infrastructure of FA
labs has the potential to automate a variety of tasks, including the detection
of non-conformities in images, the retrieval of analogous cases from diverse
data sources, and the generation of reports from annotated images. However, as
the number of deployed AI models increases, the challenge lies in orchestrating
these components into cohesive and efficient workflows that seamlessly
integrate with the FA process.
  This paper investigates the design and implementation of a Large Language
Model (LLM)-based Planning Agent (LPA) to assist FA engineers in solving their
analysis cases. The LPA integrates LLMs with advanced planning capabilities and
external tool utilization, enabling autonomous processing of complex queries,
retrieval of relevant data from external systems, and generation of
human-readable responses. Evaluation results demonstrate the agent's
operational effectiveness and reliability in supporting FA tasks.

### [7] [The Effect of State Representation on LLM Agent Behavior in Dynamic Routing Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15624)
*Lyle Goodyear,Rachel Guo,Ramesh Johari*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a systematic framework for designing natural language state representations for Large Language Models (LLMs) in multi-agent games, emphasizing its impact on agent behavior and game stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs need structured natural language representations of history to function as decision-makers in dynamic multi-agent settings, as existing methods to encode game histories are inconsistent and opaque.

Method: The paper introduces a framework analyzing state representations along three axes: action informativeness, reward informativeness, and prompting style, and applies it to a dynamic selfish routing game.

Result: Representations summarizing history, emphasizing regrets over payoffs, and restricting information about others' actions lead to agent behaviors closer to theoretical equilibria and increase game stability.

Conclusion: Natural language state representation is critical in shaping LLM agent behaviors in decision-making tasks, and a systematic approach improves adherence to equilibria and stability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise as decision-makers in dynamic
settings, but their stateless nature necessitates creating a natural language
representation of history. We present a unifying framework for systematically
constructing natural language "state" representations for prompting LLM agents
in repeated multi-agent games. Previous work on games with LLM agents has taken
an ad hoc approach to encoding game history, which not only obscures the impact
of state representation on agents' behavior, but also limits comparability
between studies. Our framework addresses these gaps by characterizing methods
of state representation along three axes: action informativeness (i.e., the
extent to which the state representation captures actions played); reward
informativeness (i.e., the extent to which the state representation describes
rewards obtained); and prompting style (or natural language compression, i.e.,
the extent to which the full text history is summarized).
  We apply this framework to a dynamic selfish routing game, chosen because it
admits a simple equilibrium both in theory and in human subject experiments
\cite{rapoport_choice_2009}. Despite the game's relative simplicity, we find
that there are key dependencies of LLM agent behavior on the natural language
state representation. In particular, we observe that representations which
provide agents with (1) summarized, rather than complete, natural language
representations of past history; (2) information about regrets, rather than raw
payoffs; and (3) limited information about others' actions lead to behavior
that more closely matches game theoretic equilibrium predictions, and with more
stable game play by the agents. By contrast, other representations can exhibit
either large deviations from equilibrium, higher variation in dynamic game play
over time, or both.

### [8] [The AI Policy Module: Developing Computer Science Student Competency in AI Ethics and Policy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15639)
*James Weichert,Daniel Dunlap,Mohammed Farghally,Hoda Eldardiry*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discusses integrating an AI Policy Module into computer science education to address gaps in training related to AI ethics and regulation. After implementing an updated version, students became more aware of ethical challenges and felt better prepared to discuss AI regulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI ethics and regulation are becoming essential due to AI's increasing presence in society, but current CS curricula don't adequately prepare AI practitioners for these challenges.

Method: An AI Policy Module was introduced, tested, and expanded in the CS curriculum, featuring educational discussions on ethics and a technical AI regulation assignment. Pre- and post-module surveys assessed student attitudes.

Result: Students showed increased concern for AI ethics and greater confidence in engaging with AI regulatory discussions after completing the module.

Conclusion: The AI Policy Module and the included assignment effectively enhanced students' awareness of ethical impacts and their ability to engage in AI policy discussions, addressing critical gaps in CS education.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) further embeds itself into many settings
across personal and professional contexts, increasing attention must be paid
not only to AI ethics, but also to the governance and regulation of AI
technologies through AI policy. However, the prevailing post-secondary
computing curriculum is currently ill-equipped to prepare future AI
practitioners to confront increasing demands to implement abstract ethical
principles and normative policy preferences into the design and development of
AI systems. We believe that familiarity with the 'AI policy landscape' and the
ability to translate ethical principles to practices will in the future
constitute an important responsibility for even the most technically-focused AI
engineers.
  Toward preparing current computer science (CS) students for these new
expectations, we developed an AI Policy Module to introduce discussions of AI
policy into the CS curriculum. Building on a successful pilot in fall 2024, in
this innovative practice full paper we present an updated and expanded version
of the module, including a technical assignment on "AI regulation". We present
the findings from our pilot of the AI Policy Module 2.0, evaluating student
attitudes towards AI ethics and policy through pre- and post-module surveys.
Following the module, students reported increased concern about the ethical
impacts of AI technologies while also expressing greater confidence in their
abilities to engage in discussions about AI regulation. Finally, we highlight
the AI Regulation Assignment as an effective and engaging tool for exploring
the limits of AI alignment and emphasizing the role of 'policy' in addressing
ethical challenges.

### [9] [Exploring and Exploiting the Inherent Efficiency within Large Reasoning Models for Self-Guided Efficiency Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15647)
*Weixiang Zhao,Jiahe Guo,Yang Deng,Xingyu Sui,Yulin Hu,Yanyan Zhao,Wanxiang Che,Bing Qin,Tat-Seng Chua,Ting Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses overthinking in large reasoning models (LRMs) by proposing methods to make their reasoning more concise without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inefficiency of LRMs caused by overthinking leads to increased inference costs and redundancy, despite their potential for concise reasoning.

Method: Two approaches were introduced: Efficiency Steering for modulating behavior via activation steering and Self-Rewarded Efficiency RL for balancing accuracy and brevity in reasoning.

Result: Empirical results across seven models and benchmarks show reduced reasoning length and maintained or enhanced task performance.

Conclusion: Reasoning efficiency in LRMs can be improved by guiding their intrinsic capabilities using lightweight, self-guided methods.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) have significantly
enhanced language models' capabilities in complex problem-solving by emulating
human-like deliberative thinking. However, these models often exhibit
overthinking (i.e., the generation of unnecessarily verbose and redundant
content), which hinders efficiency and inflates inference cost. In this work,
we explore the representational and behavioral origins of this inefficiency,
revealing that LRMs inherently possess the capacity for more concise reasoning.
Empirical analyses show that correct reasoning paths vary significantly in
length, and the shortest correct responses often suffice, indicating untapped
efficiency potential. Exploiting these findings, we propose two lightweight
methods to enhance LRM efficiency. First, we introduce Efficiency Steering, a
training-free activation steering technique that modulates reasoning behavior
via a single direction in the model's representation space. Second, we develop
Self-Rewarded Efficiency RL, a reinforcement learning framework that
dynamically balances task accuracy and brevity by rewarding concise correct
solutions. Extensive experiments on seven LRM backbones across multiple
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our methods significantly
reduce reasoning length while preserving or improving task performance. Our
results highlight that reasoning efficiency can be improved by leveraging and
guiding the intrinsic capabilities of existing models in a self-guided manner.

TL;DR: SwarmAgentic is a framework for fully automated generation of autonomous multi-agent systems, inspired by swarm intelligence and Particle Swarm Optimization, achieving substantial improvements in open-ended tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing frameworks for agentic systems lack full autonomy, missing key aspects such as from-scratch agent generation, self-optimization, and inter-agent collaboration. This limits their adaptability and scalability.

Method: SwarmAgentic constructs agent systems fully autonomously and jointly optimizes their functionality and collaboration through language-driven exploration. The framework uses a population-based, feedback-guided approach inspired by Particle Swarm Optimization.

Result: SwarmAgentic outperformed all baselines in six open-ended tasks, achieving a +261.8% improvement over existing methods on the TravelPlanner benchmark.

Conclusion: SwarmAgentic represents a major advancement in scalable and autonomous agentic system design, merging swarm intelligence and multi-agent system generation for open-ended tasks.

Abstract: The rapid progress of Large Language Models has advanced agentic systems in
decision-making, coordination, and task execution. Yet, existing agentic system
generation frameworks lack full autonomy, missing from-scratch agent
generation, self-optimizing agent functionality, and collaboration, limiting
adaptability and scalability. We propose SwarmAgentic, a framework for fully
automated agentic system generation that constructs agentic systems from
scratch and jointly optimizes agent functionality and collaboration as
interdependent components through language-driven exploration. To enable
efficient search over system-level structures, SwarmAgentic maintains a
population of candidate systems and evolves them via feedback-guided updates,
drawing inspiration from Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). We evaluate our
method on six real-world, open-ended, and exploratory tasks involving
high-level planning, system-level coordination, and creative reasoning. Given
only a task description and an objective function, SwarmAgentic outperforms all
baselines, achieving a +261.8% relative improvement over ADAS on the
TravelPlanner benchmark, highlighting the effectiveness of full automation in
structurally unconstrained tasks. This framework marks a significant step
toward scalable and autonomous agentic system design, bridging swarm
intelligence with fully automated system multi-agent generation. Our code is
publicly released at https://yaoz720.github.io/SwarmAgentic/.

*Yining Hong,Rui Sun,Bingxuan Li,Xingcheng Yao,Maxine Wu,Alexander Chien,Da Yin,Ying Nian Wu,Zhecan James Wang,Kai-Wei Chang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI agents are typically limited to either web-based reasoning or physical-world interaction, and rarely integrate both. This paper introduces Embodied Web Agents to address this limitation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI agents struggle with tasks requiring the integration of web-based knowledge and physical interactions, limiting their utility in complex, real-world contexts.

Method: The authors developed a unified simulation platform combining realistic 3D environments with functional web interfaces, and created a benchmark suite of tasks to assess performance.

Result: Experiments indicate substantial gaps between human and AI capabilities on tasks requiring both embodied and web-based intelligence.

Conclusion: Embodied Web Agents represent an innovative step forward in cross-domain AI but highlight existing performance limitations and future research opportunities.

Abstract: AI agents today are mostly siloed - they either retrieve and reason over vast
amount of digital information and knowledge obtained online; or interact with
the physical world through embodied perception, planning and action - but
rarely both. This separation limits their ability to solve tasks that require
integrated physical and digital intelligence, such as cooking from online
recipes, navigating with dynamic map data, or interpreting real-world landmarks
using web knowledge. We introduce Embodied Web Agents, a novel paradigm for AI
agents that fluidly bridge embodiment and web-scale reasoning. To
operationalize this concept, we first develop the Embodied Web Agents task
environments, a unified simulation platform that tightly integrates realistic
3D indoor and outdoor environments with functional web interfaces. Building
upon this platform, we construct and release the Embodied Web Agents Benchmark,
which encompasses a diverse suite of tasks including cooking, navigation,
shopping, tourism, and geolocation - all requiring coordinated reasoning across
physical and digital realms for systematic assessment of cross-domain
intelligence. Experimental results reveal significant performance gaps between
state-of-the-art AI systems and human capabilities, establishing both
challenges and opportunities at the intersection of embodied cognition and
web-scale knowledge access. All datasets, codes and websites are publicly

Motivation: The motivation is to overcome integration and reliability challenges faced by resistive and eNVM-based CIM cores in end-to-end AI computing systems, and provide a more efficient solution combining SRAM-based architecture with advanced features.

Method: The method involves combining SRAM-based weight storage with multi-bit computations using linear resistors, employing open-source tools for programming/testing, and utilizing automated on-chip calibration controlled by RISC-V.

Result: The SoC achieves improved compute SNR by 25–45%, reaching 18–24 dB across multiple columns, demonstrating reproducibility and reliability of the approach.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture successfully addresses challenges in integration and reliability, showing potential for scalability with high-density technologies for advanced AI acceleration.

Abstract: Developing accurate and reliable Compute-In-Memory (CIM) architectures is
becoming a key research focus to accelerate Artificial Intelligence (AI) tasks
on hardware, particularly Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). In that regard, there
has been significant interest in analog and mixed-signal CIM architectures
aimed at increasing the efficiency of data storage and computation to handle
the massive amount of data needed by DNNs. Specifically, resistive mixed-signal
CIM cores are pushed by recent progresses in emerging Non-Volatile Memory
(eNVM) solutions. Yet, mixed-signal CIM computing cores still face several
integration and reliability challenges that hinder their large-scale adoption
into end-to-end AI computing systems. In terms of integration, resistive and
eNVM-based CIM cores need to be integrated with a control processor to realize
end-to-end AI acceleration. Moreover, SRAM-based CIM architectures are still
more efficient and easier to program than their eNVM counterparts. In terms of
reliability, analog circuits are more susceptible to variations, leading to
computation errors and degraded accuracy. This work addresses these two
challenges by proposing a self-calibrated mixed-signal CIM accelerator SoC,
fabricated in 22-nm FDSOI technology. The integration is facilitated by (1) the
CIM architecture, combining the density and ease of SRAM-based weight storage
with multi-bit computation using linear resistors, and (2) an open-source
programming and testing strategy for CIM systems. The accuracy and reliability
are enabled through an automated RISC-V controlled on-chip calibration,
allowing us to improve the compute SNR by 25 to 45% across multiple columns to
reach 18-24 dB. To showcase further integration possibilities, we show how our
proof-of-concept SoC can be extended to recent high-density linear resistor
technologies for enhanced computing performance.

to ensure scalability, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. Our work provides a
comprehensive co-design framework that jointly explores FLOPS, HBM bandwidth
and capacity, multiple network topologies (two-tier vs. FullFlat optical), the
size of the scale-out domain, and popular parallelism/optimization strategies
used in LLMs. We introduce and evaluate FullFlat network architectures, which

*Dyah Adila,Shuai Zhang,Boran Han,Bonan Min,Yuyang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents CrEst, a novel framework for evaluating the credibility of context documents used by large language models without needing manual annotations, improving their performance significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current techniques for integrating context into language models fail to address the issue of unreliable information, which can diminish performance.

Method: They propose CrEst, a weakly supervised approach to assess document credibility using semantic coherence among credible documents and integrate it into LLM inference either via black-box or white-box strategies.

Result: Experiments across models and datasets show that CrEst improves accuracy by up to 26.86% and F1 score by 3.49%, even in noisy conditions.

Conclusion: Incorporating credibility assessment enhances the reliability and performance of LLMs, addressing a critical gap in current approaches to contextual inference.

Abstract: The integration of contextual information has significantly enhanced the
performance of large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive tasks.
However, existing methods often overlook a critical challenge: the credibility
of context documents can vary widely, potentially leading to the propagation of
unreliable information. In this paper, we introduce CrEst, a novel weakly
supervised framework for assessing the credibility of context documents during
LLM inference--without requiring manual annotations. Our approach is grounded
in the insight that credible documents tend to exhibit higher semantic
coherence with other credible documents, enabling automated credibility
estimation through inter-document agreement. To incorporate credibility into
LLM inference, we propose two integration strategies: a black-box approach for
models without access to internal weights or activations, and a white-box
method that directly modifies attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments
across three model architectures and five datasets demonstrate that CrEst
consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to a 26.86% improvement
in accuracy and a 3.49% increase in F1 score. Further analysis shows that CrEst
maintains robust performance even under high-noise conditions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MDBench, a synthetic dataset designed to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on multi-document reasoning tasks, addressing current challenges in assessing MD-specific capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve evaluation benchmarks for LLMs, especially for multi-document reasoning, which is increasingly relevant given advancements in LLMs but lacks sufficient benchmarks due to high annotation costs.

Method: MDBench is generated via a synthetic process leveraging LLM-assisted edits on structured seed knowledge to create challenging multi-document reasoning tasks, along with corresponding QA examples.

Result: MDBench reveals significant weaknesses in current LLMs and prompting techniques for multi-document reasoning, even with relatively short document sets.

Conclusion: MDBench enhances evaluation efficiency, facilitates targeted MD reasoning analysis, and can be readily adapted to future developments in LLMs.

Abstract: Natural language processing evaluation has made significant progress, largely
driven by the proliferation of powerful large language mod-els (LLMs). New
evaluation benchmarks are of increasing priority as the reasoning capabilities
of LLMs are expanding at a rapid pace. In particular, while multi-document (MD)
reasoning is an area of extreme relevance given LLM capabilities in handling
longer-context inputs, few benchmarks exist to rigorously examine model
behavior in this setting. Moreover, the multi-document setting is historically
challenging for benchmark creation due to the expensive cost of annotating long
inputs. In this work, we introduce MDBench, a new dataset for evaluating LLMs
on the task of multi-document reasoning. Notably, MDBench is created through a
novel synthetic generation process, allowing us to controllably and efficiently
generate challenging document sets and the corresponding question-answer (QA)
examples. Our novel technique operates on condensed structured seed knowledge,
modifying it through LLM-assisted edits to induce MD-specific reasoning
challenges. We then convert this structured knowledge into a natural text
surface form, generating a document set and corresponding QA example. We
analyze the behavior of popular LLMs and prompting techniques, finding that
MDBENCH poses significant challenges for all methods, even with relatively
short document sets. We also see our knowledge-guided generation technique (1)
allows us to readily perform targeted analysis of MD-specific reasoning
capabilities and (2) can be adapted quickly to account for new challenges and
future modeling improvements.

### [20] [From Chat to Checkup: Can Large Language Models Assist in Diabetes Prediction?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14949)
*Shadman Sakib,Oishy Fatema Akhand,Ajwad Abrar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for diabetes prediction in comparison to traditional ML models, finding that proprietary LLMs like GPT-4o outperform open-source models and traditional methods in certain metrics, but face challenges like performance variance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ML and DL models are extensively used for diabetes prediction, but the process of using LLMs for structured numerical data remains unexplored. This paper aims to investigate whether LLMs offer a viable alternative for medical prediction tasks, such as diabetes detection.

Method: The study employs zero-shot, one-shot, and three-shot prompting to evaluate six LLMs (four open-source and two proprietary) using the Pima Indian Diabetes Database (PIDD). It compares their performance with three traditional ML models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score as metrics.

Result: Proprietary LLMs like GPT-4o and Gemma-2-27B outperform open-source models and show better or competitive performance against traditional ML models like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and SVM. Gemma-2-27B achieves the highest F1-score even against traditional models.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise for medical prediction tasks like diabetes detection. Despite variations in performance across prompting strategies, their potential warrants further research in prompt engineering and hybrid approaches for healthcare applications.

Abstract: While Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models have been widely
used for diabetes prediction, the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
structured numerical data is still not well explored. In this study, we test
the effectiveness of LLMs in predicting diabetes using zero-shot, one-shot, and
three-shot prompting methods. We conduct an empirical analysis using the Pima
Indian Diabetes Database (PIDD). We evaluate six LLMs, including four
open-source models: Gemma-2-27B, Mistral-7B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Llama-3.2-2B. We
also test two proprietary models: GPT-4o and Gemini Flash 2.0. In addition, we
compare their performance with three traditional machine learning models:
Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). We use
accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score as evaluation metrics. Our results
show that proprietary LLMs perform better than open-source ones, with GPT-4o
and Gemma-2-27B achieving the highest accuracy in few-shot settings. Notably,
Gemma-2-27B also outperforms the traditional ML models in terms of F1-score.
However, there are still issues such as performance variation across prompting
strategies and the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. This study shows that
LLMs can be useful for medical prediction tasks and encourages future work on
prompt engineering and hybrid approaches to improve healthcare predictions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a technique to generate reversible sentence embeddings enabling large language models (LLMs) to reconstruct original text exactly, utilizing a special memory token.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore reversible sentence embeddings in LLMs to facilitate exact text reconstruction without altering model weights.

Method: Introduce a special memory token optimized through training on fixed sequences, then use embedding in prompting for text reconstruction.

Result: Model scales from 100M to 8B parameters successfully reconstruct sequences; Llama 3.1 8B achieves full reconstruction across tested datasets and languages.

Conclusion: The study reveals a novel capability of LLMs with potential in memory retrieval, compression, and controlled text generation.

Abstract: In this work, we observe an interesting phenomenon: it is possible to
generate reversible sentence embeddings that allow an LLM to reconstruct the
original text exactly, without modifying the model's weights. This is achieved
by introducing a special memory token, whose embedding is optimized through
training on a fixed sequence. When prompted with this embedding, the model
reconstructs the fixed sequence exactly. We evaluate this phenomenon across
English and Spanish datasets, sequences of up to approximately 240 tokens, and
model scales ranging from 100M to 8B parameters. Notably, Llama 3.1 8B
successfully reconstructs all tested sequences. Our findings highlight an
interesting capability of LLMs and suggest potential applications in
memory-based retrieval, compression, and controlled text generation.

*Drew Walker,Swati Rajwal,Sudeshna Das,Snigdha Peddireddy,Abeed Sarker*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study uses NLP techniques to identify social isolation and loneliness from narratives in suicide cases, achieving high classifier accuracy and revealing key demographic predictors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social isolation and loneliness significantly contribute to suicide rates, but are not recorded in structured variables of the NVDRS, necessitating new detection methods.

Method: Natural language processing techniques are applied, including topic modeling for lexicon development and supervised learning classifiers to identify mentions of social isolation in narratives.

Result: Classifiers achieved an average F1 score of .86 and accuracy of .82, identifying 1,198 cases of chronic social isolation among 300,000 suicides. Predictors included being male, gay, or divorced, with odds ratios provided.

Conclusion: The developed methods enhance surveillance and intervention capabilities for social isolation and loneliness, offering valuable insights for suicide prevention initiatives.

Abstract: Social isolation and loneliness, which have been increasing in recent years
strongly contribute toward suicide rates. Although social isolation and
loneliness are not currently recorded within the US National Violent Death
Reporting System's (NVDRS) structured variables, natural language processing
(NLP) techniques can be used to identify these constructs in law enforcement
and coroner medical examiner narratives. Using topic modeling to generate
lexicon development and supervised learning classifiers, we developed
high-quality classifiers (average F1: .86, accuracy: .82). Evaluating over
300,000 suicides from 2002 to 2020, we identified 1,198 mentioning chronic
social isolation. Decedents had higher odds of chronic social isolation
classification if they were men (OR = 1.44; CI: 1.24, 1.69, p<.0001), gay (OR =
3.68; 1.97, 6.33, p<.0001), or were divorced (OR = 3.34; 2.68, 4.19, p<.0001).
We found significant predictors for other social isolation topics of recent or
impending divorce, child custody loss, eviction or recent move, and break-up.
Our methods can improve surveillance and prevention of social isolation and
loneliness in the United States.

*Zongxia Li,Yapei Chang,Yuhang Zhou,Xiyang Wu,Zichao Liang,Yoo Yeon Sung,Jordan Lee Boyd-Graber*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PrefBERT, a scoring model designed to evaluate and guide the training of open-ended long-form text generation by offering enhanced semantic reward mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating open-ended long-form text generation is complicated due to a lack of clear metrics for assessing aspects like coherence and style, which are often overlooked or biased in existing approaches.

Method: The authors propose PrefBERT, a scoring system trained on diverse response evaluation datasets to capture quality ratings and provide better semantic reward feedback in reinforcement learning (GRPO), surpassing traditional metrics like ROUGE-L and BERTScore.

Result: PrefBERT demonstrated reliability in evaluating varied long-form passages, aligning with human preferences better than traditional metrics, and yielded improved model responses during its use in policy training.

Conclusion: Using PrefBERT as a reward signal significantly improves the alignment of AI-generated outputs with human evaluations, advancing open-ended long-form text generation methods.

Abstract: Evaluating open-ended long-form generation is challenging because it is hard
to define what clearly separates good from bad outputs. Existing methods often
miss key aspects like coherence, style, or relevance, or are biased by
pretraining data, making open-ended long-form evaluation an underexplored
problem. To address this gap, we propose PrefBERT, a scoring model for
evaluating open-ended long-form generation in GRPO and guiding its training
with distinct rewards for good and bad outputs. Trained on two response
evaluation datasets with diverse long-form styles and Likert-rated quality,
PrefBERT effectively supports GRPO by offering better semantic reward feedback
than traditional metrics ROUGE-L and BERTScore do. Through comprehensive
evaluations, including LLM-as-a-judge, human ratings, and qualitative analysis,
we show that PrefBERT, trained on multi-sentence and paragraph-length
responses, remains reliable across varied long passages and aligns well with
the verifiable rewards GRPO needs. Human evaluations confirm that using
PrefBERT as the reward signal to train policy models yields responses better
aligned with human preferences than those trained with traditional metrics. Our
code is available at https://github.com/zli12321/long_form_rl.

*Ruihan Wu,Konstantin Garov,Kamalika Chaudhuri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines how learning-time choices impact the effectiveness of removing specific knowledge from large language models post-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing need for unlearning specific pieces of knowledge in LLMs due to reasons like privacy, legal compliance, or accuracy.

Method: Empirical analysis evaluating how learning-time factors, such as using paraphrased descriptions, influence unlearning performance.

Result: Findings show that learning with paraphrased descriptions enhances unlearning performance, but removing individual knowledge within a chunk of text remains challenging.

Conclusion: Knowledge encoding during training plays a significant role in enabling reliable post-hoc unlearning strategies in LLMs.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in the real world,
the ability to ``unlearn'', or remove specific pieces of knowledge post hoc,
has become essential for a variety of reasons ranging from privacy regulations
to correcting outdated or harmful content. Prior work has proposed unlearning
benchmarks and algorithms, and has typically assumed that the training process
and the target model are fixed. In this work, we empirically investigate how
learning-time choices in knowledge encoding impact the effectiveness of
unlearning factual knowledge. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1)
learning with paraphrased descriptions improves unlearning performance and (2)
unlearning individual piece of knowledge from a chunk of text is challenging.
Our results suggest that learning-time knowledge encoding may play a central
role in enabling reliable post-hoc unlearning.

### [25] [Improving Dialogue Discourse Parsing through Discourse-aware Utterance Clarification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15081)
*Yaxin Fan,Peifeng Li,Qiaoming Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in dialogue discourse parsing caused by linguistic ambiguities by introducing a Discourse-aware Clarification Module (DCM) and Contribution-aware Preference Optimization (CPO), achieving performance improvements over state-of-the-art baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ambiguities in dialogues, due to linguistic features like omission and idioms, hinder the accurate identification of discourse relations, creating significant challenges for parsers.

Method: The Discourse-aware Clarification Module (DCM) applies clarification type reasoning and discourse goal reasoning to resolve ambiguities. Additionally, Contribution-aware Preference Optimization (CPO) assesses clarification contributions to optimize DCM and reduce cascading errors.

Result: Extensive experiments on two datasets (STAC and Molweni) demonstrate the model's effectiveness in resolving ambiguities and achieving superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baseline methods.

Conclusion: The proposed DCM and CPO techniques enhance dialogue discourse parsing by resolving ambiguities effectively, contributing to significant improvements over existing parsing methods.

Abstract: Dialogue discourse parsing aims to identify and analyze discourse relations
between the utterances within dialogues. However, linguistic features in
dialogues, such as omission and idiom, frequently introduce ambiguities that
obscure the intended discourse relations, posing significant challenges for
parsers. To address this issue, we propose a Discourse-aware Clarification
Module (DCM) to enhance the performance of the dialogue discourse parser. DCM
employs two distinct reasoning processes: clarification type reasoning and
discourse goal reasoning. The former analyzes linguistic features, while the
latter distinguishes the intended relation from the ambiguous one. Furthermore,
we introduce Contribution-aware Preference Optimization (CPO) to mitigate the
risk of erroneous clarifications, thereby reducing cascading errors. CPO
enables the parser to assess the contributions of the clarifications from DCM
and provide feedback to optimize the DCM, enhancing its adaptability and
alignment with the parser's requirements. Extensive experiments on the STAC and
Molweni datasets demonstrate that our approach effectively resolves ambiguities
and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines.

TL;DR: The CKD-EHR framework leverages knowledge distillation to improve disease risk prediction efficiency and accuracy using EHR data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large language models are inefficient in clinical deployment and have insufficient representation of medical knowledge.

Method: The study fine-tunes a large language model (Qwen2.5-7B) on medical data to act as a teacher model and transfers its knowledge to a lightweight BERT model through attention distillation.

Result: CKD-EHR boosts diagnostic accuracy by 9%, improves the F1-score by 27%, and achieves a 22.2x speedup on the MIMIC-III dataset.

Conclusion: The CKD-EHR framework presents an efficient and accurate solution for disease prediction, optimizing resource use in clinical settings while offering enhanced diagnostic capabilities.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR)-based disease prediction models have
demonstrated significant clinical value in promoting precision medicine and
enabling early intervention. However, existing large language models face two
major challenges: insufficient representation of medical knowledge and low
efficiency in clinical deployment. To address these challenges, this study
proposes the CKD-EHR (Clinical Knowledge Distillation for EHR) framework, which
achieves efficient and accurate disease risk prediction through knowledge
distillation techniques. Specifically, the large language model Qwen2.5-7B is
first fine-tuned on medical knowledge-enhanced data to serve as the teacher
model.It then generates interpretable soft labels through a multi-granularity
attention distillation mechanism. Finally, the distilled knowledge is
transferred to a lightweight BERT student model. Experimental results show that
on the MIMIC-III dataset, CKD-EHR significantly outperforms the baseline
model:diagnostic accuracy is increased by 9%, F1-score is improved by 27%, and
a 22.2 times inference speedup is achieved. This innovative solution not only
greatly improves resource utilization efficiency but also significantly
enhances the accuracy and timeliness of diagnosis, providing a practical
technical approach for resource optimization in clinical settings. The code and

### [27] [Modeling the One-to-Many Property in Open-Domain Dialogue with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15131)
*Jing Yang Lee,Kong-Aik Lee,Woon-Seng Gan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to enhance response diversity and quality in open-domain dialogues by modeling the one-to-many (o2m) property, using a new corpus (o2mDial) and novel methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-domain dialogue systems have a one-to-many property where multiple valid responses exist for a given context. However, modern large language models do not explicitly address this property, leading to limited response diversity.

Method: The study introduces a two-stage approach: Multi-Response Generation (MRG) to produce diverse responses, and Preference-based Selection (PS) to choose the best response based on human preference. It uses the o2mDial corpus for training and proposes new evaluation metrics and learning strategies.

Result: Empirical results show that applying this framework to smaller LLMs significantly improves response diversity and quality, making performance closer to larger models with up to 90% improvement in response quality.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling the o2m property in LLMs can enhance the capabilities of smaller models, offering a more diverse and contextually coherent set of responses for open-domain dialogues.

Abstract: Open-domain Dialogue (OD) exhibits a one-to-many (o2m) property, whereby
multiple appropriate responses exist for a single dialogue context. Despite
prior research showing that modeling this property boosts response diversity,
most modern LLM-based dialogue agents do not explicitly do so. In this work, we
model the o2m property of OD in LLMs by decomposing OD generation into two key
tasks: Multi-Response Generation (MRG) and Preference-based Selection (PS),
which entail generating a set of n semantically and lexically diverse
high-quality responses for a given dialogue context, followed by selecting a
single response based on human preference, respectively. To facilitate MRG and
PS, we introduce o2mDial, a dialogue corpus explicitly designed to capture the
o2m property by featuring multiple plausible responses for each context.
Leveraging o2mDial, we propose new in-context learning and instruction-tuning
strategies, as well as novel evaluation metrics for MRG, alongside a
model-based approach for PS. Empirical results demonstrate that applying the
proposed two-stage framework to smaller LLMs for OD generation enhances overall
response diversity while maintaining contextual coherence, improving response

*Gyeongje Cho,Yeonkyoun So,Chanwoo Park,Sangmin Lee,Sungmok Jung,Jaejin Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents Thunder-Tok, a Korean tokenizer that lowers token count and boosts inference speed by 10% while retaining model effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address inefficiencies in tokenization for Korean language models by reducing the number of tokens without losing linguistic informativeness or impairing model performance.

Method: The method involves a rule-based pre-tokenization aligned with Korean linguistic structures, a seed vocabulary of linguistic units, and a branching entropy-based selection algorithm to optimize token length.

Result: Thunder-Tok achieves a 10% reduction in token count, enhancing inference speed by 10%, while maintaining high performance across multiple downstream tasks.

Conclusion: The findings illustrate that a linguistically informed tokenization strategy, as implemented in Thunder-Tok, can improve efficiency and practicality for Korean language model tokenizers.

Abstract: This paper introduces Thunder-Tok, a new Korean tokenizer designed to reduce
token fertility without compromising model performance. Our approach uses a
rule-based pre-tokenization method that aligns with the linguistic structure of
the Korean language. We also create a seed vocabulary containing tokens that
resemble linguistic units and employ a branching entropy-based selection
algorithm. These techniques increase the average token length, thus lowering
fertility while preserving linguistic information. Experimental results
indicate that Thunder-Tok reduces fertility by approximately 10% (i.e., reduces
the number of tokens by 10%, improving the inference speed by 10%) compared to
BPE without compromising performance across various downstream tasks. These
findings demonstrate that our linguistically informed approach is effective and
practical for designing efficient tokenizers for language models.

*Muhammad Cendekia Airlangga,Hilal AlQuabeh,Munachiso S Nwadike,Kentaro Inui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines memory retention in state-space language models (specifically Mamba architecture) through structured recall tasks, analyzing primacy and recency effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how state-space language models retain and forget information over time is crucial for designing better-performing AI systems.

Method: The study uses structured recall tasks to observe memory performance in Mamba language models and connects performance patterns to mechanisms like long-term and short-term memory encoding, as well as semantic regularity effects.

Result: They discover a U-shaped accuracy profile driven by three mechanisms: sparse channels encoding early tokens, delta-modulated recurrence for short-term memory, and dynamic memory allocation influenced by semantic regularity.

Conclusion: The findings highlight multiple mechanisms influencing memory dynamics in Mamba models, validated via ablations and perturbations across different model sizes, helping explain memory retention and forgetfulness.

Abstract: We study memory in state-space language models using primacy and recency
effects as behavioral tools to uncover how information is retained and
forgotten over time. Applying structured recall tasks to the Mamba
architecture, we observe a consistent U-shaped accuracy profile, indicating
strong performance at the beginning and end of input sequences. We identify
three mechanisms that give rise to this pattern. First, long-term memory is
supported by a sparse subset of channels within the model's selective state
space block, which persistently encode early input tokens and are causally
linked to primacy effects. Second, short-term memory is governed by
delta-modulated recurrence: recent inputs receive more weight due to
exponential decay, but this recency advantage collapses when distractor items
are introduced, revealing a clear limit to memory depth. Third, we find that
memory allocation is dynamically modulated by semantic regularity: repeated
relations in the input sequence shift the delta gating behavior, increasing the
tendency to forget intermediate items. We validate these findings via targeted
ablations and input perturbations on two large-scale Mamba-based language
models: one with 1.4B and another with 7B parameters.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study assesses large language models (LLMs) for text classification related to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), finding smaller models can match larger models when optimized with prompt engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tracking the progress of the United Nations' 17 SDGs is challenging due to the vast and complex data involved, necessitating advanced text classification tools.

Method: The paper analyzes proprietary and open-source LLMs for single-label, multi-class text classification of SDGs. It evaluates task adaptation techniques including Zero-Shot, Few-Shot Learning, and Fine-Tuning.

Result: Smaller LLMs, when optimized using prompt engineering, perform comparably to larger models like OpenAI's GPT in SDG-related text classification tasks.

Conclusion: Advanced optimization techniques enable smaller models to achieve similar effectiveness as larger models, enhancing resource efficiency in SDG data analysis.

Abstract: In 2012, the United Nations introduced 17 Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs) aimed at creating a more sustainable and improved future by 2030.
However, tracking progress toward these goals is difficult because of the
extensive scale and complexity of the data involved. Text classification models
have become vital tools in this area, automating the analysis of vast amounts
of text from a variety of sources. Additionally, large language models (LLMs)
have recently proven indispensable for many natural language processing tasks,
including text classification, thanks to their ability to recognize complex
linguistic patterns and semantics. This study analyzes various proprietary and
open-source LLMs for a single-label, multi-class text classification task
focused on the SDGs. Then, it also evaluates the effectiveness of task
adaptation techniques (i.e., in-context learning approaches), namely Zero-Shot
and Few-Shot Learning, as well as Fine-Tuning within this domain. The results
reveal that smaller models, when optimized through prompt engineering, can
perform on par with larger models like OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained
Transformer).

*Feng He,Zijun Chen,Xinnian Liang,Tingting Ma,Yunqi Qiu,Shuangzhi Wu,Junchi Yan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces ProtoReasoning, a framework leveraging abstract reasoning prototypes to boost generalization abilities in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), showing improvements in various reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand and enhance cross-domain generalization in LRMs, hypothesizing that shared abstract reasoning prototypes are the key enablers of this capability.

Method: ProtoReasoning adopts a framework featuring: automated prototype construction (e.g., Prolog, PDDL), verification via interpreters, and scalability for generating correct prototype problems.

Result: Experimental results show 4.7% improvement in logical reasoning, 6.3% in planning tasks, 4.0% in general reasoning, and 1.0% in mathematics, with better generalization to similar problems.

Conclusion: The study validates that reasoning prototypes enhance generalization in LRMs, providing a framework to train models on abstract reasoning structures for better cross-domain performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) trained with Long
Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) reasoning have demonstrated remarkable cross-domain
generalization capabilities. However, the underlying mechanisms supporting such
transfer remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that cross-domain
generalization arises from shared abstract reasoning prototypes -- fundamental
reasoning patterns that capture the essence of problems across domains. These
prototypes minimize the nuances of the representation, revealing that seemingly
diverse tasks are grounded in shared reasoning structures.Based on this
hypothesis, we propose ProtoReasoning, a framework that enhances the reasoning
ability of LLMs by leveraging scalable and verifiable prototypical
representations (Prolog for logical reasoning, PDDL for
planning).ProtoReasoning features: (1) an automated prototype construction
pipeline that transforms problems into corresponding prototype representations;
(2) a comprehensive verification system providing reliable feedback through
Prolog/PDDL interpreters; (3) the scalability to synthesize problems
arbitrarily within prototype space while ensuring correctness. Extensive
experiments show that ProtoReasoning achieves 4.7% improvement over baseline
models on logical reasoning (Enigmata-Eval), 6.3% improvement on planning
tasks, 4.0% improvement on general reasoning (MMLU) and 1.0% on mathematics
(AIME24). Significantly, our ablation studies confirm that learning in
prototype space also demonstrates enhanced generalization to structurally
similar problems compared to training solely on natural language
representations, validating our hypothesis that reasoning prototypes serve as
the foundation for generalizable reasoning in large language models.

*Yongqi Fan,Yating Wang,Guandong Wang,Jie Zhai,Jingping Liu,Qi Ye,Tong Ruan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces MinosEval, a novel evaluation method for open-ended question answering (QA) by distinguishing between factoid and non-factoid questions and applying different strategies for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods for open-ended QA using large language models (LLMs) face challenges like difficulty in capturing semantic similarities, lack of interpretability, and inability to adapt evaluation methods to different question types (factoid vs. non-factoid).

Method: MinosEval distinguishes between factoid and non-factoid open-ended questions. It leverages an adaptive key-point scoring strategy for factoid questions and an instance-aware listwise ranking strategy for non-factoid ones.

Result: MinosEval demonstrates superior alignment with human annotations and provides more interpretable evaluation results in experiments conducted on multiple open-ended QA datasets, including self-built datasets.

Conclusion: MinosEval offers a more refined, interpretable, and adaptable approach to evaluating open-ended QA tasks compared to traditional and LLM-based methods, addressing key limitations of existing strategies.

Abstract: Open-ended question answering (QA) is a key task for evaluating the
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Compared to closed-ended QA, it
demands longer answer statements, more nuanced reasoning processes, and diverse
expressions, making refined and interpretable automatic evaluation both crucial
and challenging. Traditional metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore struggle to
capture semantic similarities due to different patterns between model responses
and reference answers. Current LLM-based evaluation approaches, such as
pairwise or listwise comparisons of candidate answers, lack intuitive
interpretability. While pointwise scoring of each response provides some
descriptions, it fails to adapt across different question contents. Most
notably, existing methods overlook the distinction between factoid and
non-factoid questions. To address these challenges, we propose
\textbf{MinosEval}, a novel evaluation method that first distinguishes
open-ended questions and then ranks candidate answers using different
evaluation strategies. For factoid questions, it applies an adaptive key-point
scoring strategy, while for non-factoid questions, it uses an instance-aware
listwise ranking strategy. Experiments on multiple open-ended QA datasets,
including self-built ones with more candidate responses to complement community
resources, show that MinosEval better aligns with human annotations and offers
more interpretable results.

*Jaione Bengoetxea,Itziar Gonzalez-Dios,Rodrigo Agerri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper assesses the ability of language technologies to handle Basque and Spanish language variations using a new dataset and NLP tools, revealing difficulties, especially with Basque linguistic diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the capacity of current language technologies, particularly Large Language Models, to process and understand the variations within the Basque and Spanish languages.

Method: The authors introduced a manually-curated parallel dataset in Basque and Spanish (including their variants) and conducted crosslingual and in-context learning experiments using encoder-only and decoder-based Large Language Models (LLMs).

Result: The results show a performance drop when models handle linguistic variation, particularly with Basque variants, and encoder-only models struggle the most with Western Basque, aligning with linguistic theories about peripheral dialects.

Conclusion: The study highlights the difficulty of handling linguistic variation in Basque and Spanish language processing, emphasizing challenges and areas for further improvement in language technology tools.

Abstract: In this paper, we evaluate the capacity of current language technologies to
understand Basque and Spanish language varieties. We use Natural Language
Inference (NLI) as a pivot task and introduce a novel, manually-curated
parallel dataset in Basque and Spanish, along with their respective variants.
Our empirical analysis of crosslingual and in-context learning experiments
using encoder-only and decoder-based Large Language Models (LLMs) shows a
performance drop when handling linguistic variation, especially in Basque.
Error analysis suggests that this decline is not due to lexical overlap, but
rather to the linguistic variation itself. Further ablation experiments
indicate that encoder-only models particularly struggle with Western Basque,
which aligns with linguistic theory that identifies peripheral dialects (e.g.,
Western) as more distant from the standard. All data and code are publicly
available.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Graph RAG framework for improving historical text analysis using large language models, combining graph-based methods and process supervision to enhance relation extraction and reduce manual annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of general large language models in the domain of historical text analysis, specifically for computational humanities and AIGC technology, while also aiming to reduce labor costs in data annotation.

Method: The authors propose the Graph RAG framework, which integrates chain-of-thought prompting, self-instruction generation, process supervision, and a collaboration mechanism between knowledge graphs and retrieval-augmented generation to improve model alignment with historical knowledge.

Result: The domain-specific model Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B achieves an F1 score of 0.68 for relation extraction, while the DeepSeek model integrated with Graph RAG demonstrates an 11% improvement in F1 on the open-domain C-CLUE dataset, enhancing interpretability and reducing hallucinations.

Conclusion: Graph RAG is a low-resource, effective framework for extracting historical knowledge from classical texts, advancing computational humanities and improving the performance and reliability of large language models in this field.

Abstract: This article addresses domain knowledge gaps in general large language models
for historical text analysis in the context of computational humanities and
AIGC technology. We propose the Graph RAG framework, combining chain-of-thought
prompting, self-instruction generation, and process supervision to create a The
First Four Histories character relationship dataset with minimal manual
annotation. This dataset supports automated historical knowledge extraction,
reducing labor costs. In the graph-augmented generation phase, we introduce a
collaborative mechanism between knowledge graphs and retrieval-augmented
generation, improving the alignment of general models with historical
knowledge. Experiments show that the domain-specific model Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B,
with Simplified Chinese input and chain-of-thought prompting, achieves optimal
performance in relation extraction (F1 = 0.68). The DeepSeek model integrated
with GraphRAG improves F1 by 11% (0.08-0.19) on the open-domain C-CLUE relation
extraction dataset, surpassing the F1 value of Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B (0.12),
effectively alleviating hallucinations phenomenon, and improving
interpretability. This framework offers a low-resource solution for classical
text knowledge extraction, advancing historical knowledge services and
humanities research.

Motivation: The paper aims to improve retrieval-augmented generation systems for end-to-end question answering over large-scale web corpora.

Method: The system employs hybrid retrieval (sparse and dense), clustering with K-Means, and LLM prompt aggregation. Answers are generated through clustered context filtering, then filtered, reranked, and synthesized.

Result: TopClustRAG achieved 2nd place in answer faithfulness and 7th place in correctness on the FineWeb Sample-10BT dataset leaderboard.

Conclusion: The proposed clustering-based pipeline effectively enhances answer diversity, relevance, and alignment with retrieved evidence in RAG systems.

Abstract: We present TopClustRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system
developed for the LiveRAG Challenge, which evaluates end-to-end question
answering over large-scale web corpora. Our system employs a hybrid retrieval
strategy combining sparse and dense indices, followed by K-Means clustering to
group semantically similar passages. Representative passages from each cluster
are used to construct cluster-specific prompts for a large language model
(LLM), generating intermediate answers that are filtered, reranked, and finally
synthesized into a single, comprehensive response. This multi-stage pipeline
enhances answer diversity, relevance, and faithfulness to retrieved evidence.
Evaluated on the FineWeb Sample-10BT dataset, TopClustRAG ranked 2nd in
faithfulness and 7th in correctness on the official leaderboard, demonstrating
the effectiveness of clustering-based context filtering and prompt aggregation
in large-scale RAG systems.

*Sungen Hahm,Heejin Kim,Gyuseong Lee,Hyunji Park,Jaejin Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents Thunder-DeID, a framework for de-identifying South Korean court judgments using AI while adhering to legal requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Handling large-scale court judgment de-identification in South Korea is challenging due to vague legal definitions and the inadequacy of current systems.

Method: The approach includes constructing a Korean legal dataset, categorizing PII systematically, and developing a deep neural network-based de-identification pipeline.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results for de-identifying court judgments in South Korea.

Conclusion: Thunder-DeID effectively balances open justice and personal data protection, addressing legal and technical challenges in judicial de-identification.

Abstract: To ensure a balance between open access to justice and personal data
protection, the South Korean judiciary mandates the de-identification of court
judgments before they can be publicly disclosed. However, the current
de-identification process is inadequate for handling court judgments at scale
while adhering to strict legal requirements. Additionally, the legal
definitions and categorizations of personal identifiers are vague and not
well-suited for technical solutions. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
de-identification framework called Thunder-DeID, which aligns with relevant
laws and practices. Specifically, we (i) construct and release the first Korean
legal dataset containing annotated judgments along with corresponding lists of
entity mentions, (ii) introduce a systematic categorization of Personally
Identifiable Information (PII), and (iii) develop an end-to-end deep neural
network (DNN)-based de-identification pipeline. Our experimental results
demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in the
de-identification of court judgments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper surveys the use of large language models (LLMs) for matching clinical trials and patients, identifying challenges and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advancements in LLMs for general NLP tasks, their application in critical domains like clinical trial recruitment is minimal. The task of matching trials and patients requires advanced capabilities like knowledge aggregation and reasoning, which LLMs can potentially fulfill.

Method: The authors critically assess existing benchmarks, LLM-based approaches, and evaluation frameworks in the context of clinical trial-patient matching, while also outlining current challenges and potential future developments.

Result: LLMs hold promise for creating generalizable solutions in trial-patient matching compared to traditional, trial-specific methods. However, existing models often rely on proprietary systems and subpar evaluation benchmarks.

Conclusion: Though LLMs have the potential to advance clinical trial recruitment, there are significant limitations in current benchmarks and proprietary models. The study emphasizes the need for better evaluation frameworks and explores future research opportunities.

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have greatly improved general-domain NLP tasks. Yet,
their adoption in critical domains, such as clinical trial recruitment, remains
limited. As trials are designed in natural language and patient data is
represented as both structured and unstructured text, the task of matching
trials and patients benefits from knowledge aggregation and reasoning abilities
of LLMs. Classical approaches are trial-specific and LLMs with their ability to
consolidate distributed knowledge hold the potential to build a more general
solution. Yet recent applications of LLM-assisted methods rely on proprietary
models and weak evaluation benchmarks. In this survey, we are the first to
analyze the task of trial-patient matching and contextualize emerging LLM-based
approaches in clinical trial recruitment. We critically examine existing
benchmarks, approaches and evaluation frameworks, the challenges to adopting
LLM technologies in clinical research and exciting future directions.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a supervised contrastive learning (SCL) method to improve language identification for low-resource languages, achieving a 3.2% improvement on out-of-domain data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-resource languages often perform poorly in language identification due to class imbalances and reliance on single-domain training data.

Method: The authors introduce a supervised contrastive learning approach to create domain-invariant representations, addressing biases and imbalances in low-resource language data.

Result: Their method improves language identification performance for low-resource languages on out-of-domain data by 3.2%.

Conclusion: Using supervised contrastive learning, the study successfully enhances language identification models for low-resource languages, particularly in out-of-domain scenarios.

Abstract: Language identification (LID) is a critical step in curating multilingual LLM
pretraining corpora from web crawls. While many studies on LID model training
focus on collecting diverse training data to improve performance, low-resource
languages -- often limited to single-domain data, such as the Bible -- continue
to perform poorly. To resolve these class imbalance and bias issues, we propose
a novel supervised contrastive learning (SCL) approach to learn
domain-invariant representations for low-resource languages. Through an
extensive analysis, we show that our approach improves LID performance on
out-of-domain data for low-resource languages by 3.2%, demonstrating its
effectiveness in enhancing LID models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DeVisE, a testing framework for evaluating the clinical reasoning of large language models (LLMs) using ICU discharge notes, revealing differences in zero-shot and fine-tuned model performances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods often fail to effectively assess genuine clinical reasoning, necessitating a better framework for understanding LLM behavior in medical decision-making.

Method: The authors developed DeVisE, a behavioral testing approach, utilizing a dataset of ICU discharge notes with counterfactual modifications targeting demographic and vital sign attributes, and evaluated LLMs across sensitivity and reasoning tasks.

Result: Zero-shot LLMs showed coherent counterfactual reasoning, while fine-tuned models were more stable but less responsive to clinical changes. Demographics were found to influence model outputs consistently.

Conclusion: Behavioral testing is valuable for revealing reasoning strategies in clinical LLMs, supporting fairness-aware evaluations and fostering safer, more transparent AI in healthcare.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in clinical decision
support, yet current evaluation methods often fail to distinguish genuine
medical reasoning from superficial patterns. We introduce DeVisE (Demographics
and Vital signs Evaluation), a behavioral testing framework for probing
fine-grained clinical understanding. We construct a dataset of ICU discharge
notes from MIMIC-IV, generating both raw (real-world) and template-based
(synthetic) versions with controlled single-variable counterfactuals targeting
demographic (age, gender, ethnicity) and vital sign attributes. We evaluate
five LLMs spanning general-purpose and medically fine-tuned variants, under
both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. We assess model behavior via (1)
input-level sensitivity - how counterfactuals alter the likelihood of a note;
and (2) downstream reasoning - how they affect predicted hospital
length-of-stay. Our results show that zero-shot models exhibit more coherent
counterfactual reasoning patterns, while fine-tuned models tend to be more
stable yet less responsive to clinically meaningful changes. Notably,
demographic factors subtly but consistently influence outputs, emphasizing the
importance of fairness-aware evaluation. This work highlights the utility of
behavioral testing in exposing the reasoning strategies of clinical LLMs and
informing the design of safer, more transparent medical AI systems.

TL;DR: SANSKRITI is a large-scale benchmark with 21,853 questions to evaluate the cultural understanding of language models on Indian socio-cultural diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models lack a deep understanding of local socio-cultural contexts like that of India's rich diversity. This gap limits their global effectiveness.

Method: The paper introduces SANSKRITI, a benchmark with 21,853 question-answer pairs covering 16 aspects of Indian culture, enabling the evaluation of various language models against this dataset.

Result: The study shows large disparities in the performance of different types of language models (LLMs, ILMs, SLMs) on culturally nuanced and region-specific queries.

Conclusion: SANSKRITI establishes a new standard for testing and enhancing language models' cultural understanding, emphasizing the need for context-aware AI systems.

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are indispensable tools shaping modern workflows, but
their global effectiveness depends on understanding local socio-cultural
contexts. To address this, we introduce SANSKRITI, a benchmark designed to
evaluate language models' comprehension of India's rich cultural diversity.
Comprising 21,853 meticulously curated question-answer pairs spanning 28 states
and 8 union territories, SANSKRITI is the largest dataset for testing Indian
cultural knowledge. It covers sixteen key attributes of Indian culture: rituals
and ceremonies, history, tourism, cuisine, dance and music, costume, language,
art, festivals, religion, medicine, transport, sports, nightlife, and
personalities, providing a comprehensive representation of India's cultural
tapestry. We evaluate SANSKRITI on leading Large Language Models (LLMs), Indic
Language Models (ILMs), and Small Language Models (SLMs), revealing significant
disparities in their ability to handle culturally nuanced queries, with many
models struggling in region-specific contexts. By offering an extensive,
culturally rich, and diverse dataset, SANSKRITI sets a new standard for
assessing and improving the cultural understanding of LMs.

TL;DR: This paper introduces COSMMIC, a multimodal and multilingual dataset specifically tailored for Indian languages, incorporating text, images, and user comments to enhance summarization tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of research and resources for multimodal and multilingual summarization in Indian languages, despite progress in other languages like English and Chinese, motivates the authors to create COSMMIC.

Method: The study introduces COSMMIC, a dataset that includes article-image pairs, reader comments, and multilingual ground-truth summaries. Experiments are conducted using models like LLama3, GPT-4, and IndicBERT to evaluate various configurations, including filtering noise and leveraging insights from images.

Result: Results highlight configurations integrating text, comments, and images as promising for advancing natural language generation (NLG) tasks.

Conclusion: COSMMIC bridges the resource gap for Indian language NLP tasks, showcasing its potential for inclusive and comprehensive summarization research while advancing multimodal NLP in underrepresented languages.

Abstract: Despite progress in comment-aware multimodal and multilingual summarization
for English and Chinese, research in Indian languages remains limited. This
study addresses this gap by introducing COSMMIC, a pioneering comment-sensitive
multimodal, multilingual dataset featuring nine major Indian languages. COSMMIC
comprises 4,959 article-image pairs and 24,484 reader comments, with
ground-truth summaries available in all included languages. Our approach
enhances summaries by integrating reader insights and feedback. We explore
summarization and headline generation across four configurations: (1) using
article text alone, (2) incorporating user comments, (3) utilizing images, and
(4) combining text, comments, and images. To assess the dataset's
effectiveness, we employ state-of-the-art language models such as LLama3 and
GPT-4. We conduct a comprehensive study to evaluate different component
combinations, including identifying supportive comments, filtering out noise
using a dedicated comment classifier using IndicBERT, and extracting valuable
insights from images with a multilingual CLIP-based classifier. This helps
determine the most effective configurations for natural language generation
(NLG) tasks. Unlike many existing datasets that are either text-only or lack
user comments in multimodal settings, COSMMIC uniquely integrates text, images,
and user feedback. This holistic approach bridges gaps in Indian language
resources, advancing NLP research and fostering inclusivity.

*Stanley Ngugi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Targeted Lexical Injection (TLI), a fine-tuning method to improve cross-lingual alignment in low-resource language models, achieving significant results for Swahili-English word pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the poor lexical alignment and performance of Large Language Models in low-resource languages like Swahili due to limited pre-training data.

Method: The paper uses Targeted Lexical Injection (TLI) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and contrastive learning, focusing on optimal early-layer embeddings identified through experimental analysis.

Result: TLI enhances lexical alignment with average cosine similarity improving by 28.08% for trained word pairs and 28.32% for unseen word pairs.

Conclusion: TLI is a parameter-efficient strategy to improve cross-lingual lexical alignment in low-resource language models, effectively leveraging inherent early-layer knowledge.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet
their performance in low-resource languages (LRLs), such as Swahili, often lags
due to data scarcity and underrepresentation in pre-training. A key challenge
is achieving robust cross-lingual lexical alignment, crucial for tasks like
translation and cross-lingual information retrieval. This paper introduces
Targeted Lexical Injection (TLI), a novel and efficient fine-tuning approach.
We first demonstrate that Lugha-Llama-8B-wura, a Swahili-centric LLM, exhibits
strong, near-perfect lexical alignment for Swahili-English word pairs in its
early internal layers (specifically Layer 2, with ~0.99998 average cosine
similarity based on a pilot study), a capability not fully reflected in its
final output representations (baseline ~0.32 similarity on our evaluation set).
TLI leverages this insight by using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and a
contrastive learning objective to fine-tune the model, specifically targeting
embeddings from this empirically identified optimal early layer. Our
experiments show that TLI significantly improves the output-level lexical
alignment for 623 trained Swahili-English word pairs, increasing average cosine
similarity from 0.3211 to 0.4113 (+28.08%, p < 1.33 x 10^-240). More
importantly, these improvements generalize remarkably well to 63 unseen control
word pairs, with similarity increasing from 0.3143 to 0.4033 (+28.32%, p < 7.17
x 10^-27). These findings suggest TLI enhances the model's ability to preserve
and propagate its inherent early-layer cross-lingual knowledge, offering a
parameter-efficient and effective strategy for improving lexical alignment in
LRL-focused LLMs.

### [43] [Understanding GUI Agent Localization Biases through Logit Sharpness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15425)
*Xingjian Tao,Yiwei Wang,Yujun Cai,Zhicheng Yang,Jing Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a fine-grained evaluation framework for multimodal large language models (MLLMs) interacting with GUI systems to address localization errors, introduces a new uncertainty metric (Peak Sharpness Score), and proposes a training-free improvement technique (Context-Aware Cropping).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLM-enabled GUI systems often suffer from systematic localization errors (hallucinations), compromising their reliability, which calls for improved evaluation metrics and techniques.

Method: The authors developed a fine-grained evaluation framework to categorize model predictions, introduced the Peak Sharpness Score metric to assess alignment between semantic continuity and logits, and proposed Context-Aware Cropping to refine input contexts adaptively without additional training.

Result: Extensive experiments reveal nuanced failure modes via the evaluation framework, demonstrate the efficacy of Peak Sharpness Score in quantifying uncertainty, and validate improvements in performance and robustness using Context-Aware Cropping.

Conclusion: The proposed methods enhance the interpretability, robustness, and insight-generation for GUI agents powered by MLLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled GUI agents to interact
with operating systems by grounding language into spatial actions. Despite
their promising performance, these models frequently exhibit
hallucinations-systematic localization errors that compromise reliability. We
propose a fine-grained evaluation framework that categorizes model predictions
into four distinct types, revealing nuanced failure modes beyond traditional
accuracy metrics. To better quantify model uncertainty, we introduce the Peak
Sharpness Score (PSS), a metric that evaluates the alignment between semantic
continuity and logits distribution in coordinate prediction. Building on this
insight, we further propose Context-Aware Cropping, a training-free technique
that improves model performance by adaptively refining input context. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework and methods provide actionable
insights and enhance the interpretability and robustness of GUI agent behavior.

TL;DR: AgentGroupChat-V2 introduces a novel framework to address challenges in designing large language model-based multi-agent systems, excelling in complex task resolution with superior performance metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in multi-agent system frameworks such as architectural inefficiencies, poor cross-domain scalability, and unreliable performance for complex tasks.

Method: Utilizes a fully parallel divide-and-conquer architecture for task decomposition, an adaptive collaboration engine for dynamic LLM selection, and optimization strategies for agent organization.

Result: Outperformed baselines with 91.50% accuracy on GSM8K, 30.4% on AIME, and 79.20% pass@1 on HumanEval, with marked improvements on high-difficulty tasks like Level 5 MATH problems.

Conclusion: AgentGroupChat-V2 offers an efficient and versatile solution for general-purpose LLM multi-agent systems, particularly excelling in complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large language model based multi-agent systems have demonstrated significant
potential in social simulation and complex task resolution domains. However,
current frameworks face critical challenges in system architecture design,
cross-domain generalizability, and performance guarantees, particularly as task
complexity and number of agents increases. We introduces AgentGroupChat-V2, a
novel framework addressing these challenges through three core innovations: (1)
a divide-and-conquer fully parallel architecture that decomposes user queries
into hierarchical task forest structures enabling dependency management and
distributed concurrent processing. (2) an adaptive collaboration engine that
dynamically selects heterogeneous LLM combinations and interaction modes based
on task characteristics. (3) agent organization optimization strategies
combining divide-and-conquer approaches for efficient problem decomposition.
Extensive experiments demonstrate AgentGroupChat-V2's superior performance
across diverse domains, achieving 91.50% accuracy on GSM8K (exceeding the best
baseline by 5.6 percentage points), 30.4% accuracy on competition-level AIME
(nearly doubling other methods), and 79.20% pass@1 on HumanEval. Performance
advantages become increasingly pronounced with higher task difficulty,
particularly on Level 5 MATH problems where improvements exceed 11 percentage
points compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results confirm that
AgentGroupChat-V2 provides a comprehensive solution for building efficient,
general-purpose LLM multi-agent systems with significant advantages in complex
reasoning scenarios. Code is available at

### [45] [RE-IMAGINE: Symbolic Benchmark Synthesis for Reasoning Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15455)
*Xinnuo Xu,Rachel Lawrence,Kshitij Dubey,Atharva Pandey,Risa Ueno,Fabian Falck,Aditya V. Nori,Rahul Sharma,Amit Sharma,Javier Gonzalez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces RE-IMAGINE, a framework to evaluate Large Language Models' (LLMs) reasoning abilities beyond mere memorization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ascertain if the reasoning capabilities of LLMs are genuinely rooted in reasoning rather than statistical recall of training data.

Method: Developed RE-IMAGINE, which leverages variations in symbolic representations to assess reasoning abilities across three levels of the causal hierarchy while ensuring questions cannot be solved via memorization.

Result: Observed significant reductions in LLMs' performance when queried with variations, suggesting reliance on statistical recall.

Conclusion: The study challenges current claims about LLMs' reasoning skills and establishes a path for further research into advancing hierarchical reasoning abilities in AI.

Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have reported high accuracy on reasoning
benchmarks. However, it is still unclear whether the observed results arise
from true reasoning or from statistical recall of the training set. Inspired by
the ladder of causation (Pearl, 2009) and its three levels (associations,
interventions and counterfactuals), this paper introduces RE-IMAGINE, a
framework to characterize a hierarchy of reasoning ability in LLMs, alongside
an automated pipeline to generate problem variations at different levels of the
hierarchy. By altering problems in an intermediate symbolic representation,
RE-IMAGINE generates arbitrarily many problems that are not solvable using
memorization alone. Moreover, the framework is general and can work across
reasoning domains, including math, code, and logic. We demonstrate our
framework on four widely-used benchmarks to evaluate several families of LLMs,
and observe reductions in performance when the models are queried with problem
variations. These assessments indicate a degree of reliance on statistical
recall for past performance, and open the door to further research targeting
skills across the reasoning hierarchy.

*Hyunji Lee,Seunghyun Yoon,Yunjae Won,Hanseok Oh,Geewook Kim,Trung Bui,Franck Dernoncourt,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Mohit Bansal,Minjoon Seo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Context-INformed Grounding Supervision (CINGS), a post-training technique to improve the grounding of responses in large language models (LLMs) using external contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often hallucinate or fail to properly utilize external knowledge, especially when simply appending external context during inference. This creates a need for a better grounding mechanism.

Method: CINGS involves post-training the model with relevant context prepended to the response. During training, the loss is computed only over the response tokens while masking the context tokens.

Result: CINGS improves grounding in textual and visual domains. Text domain models trained with CINGS outperform other training methods across 11 datasets and complement inference-time techniques. In the vision-language domain, CINGS reduces hallucinations and maintains factual consistency across benchmarks.

Conclusion: CINGS effectively enhances grounding without degrading overall performance. It shifts the model's reliance towards external context, improving its ability to generate consistent and reliable responses.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often supplemented with external knowledge
to provide information not encoded in their parameters or to reduce
hallucination. In such cases, we expect the model to generate responses by
grounding its response in the provided external context. However, prior work
has shown that simply appending context at inference time does not ensure
grounded generation. To address this, we propose Context-INformed Grounding
Supervision (CINGS), a post-training supervision in which the model is trained
with relevant context prepended to the response, while computing the loss only
over the response tokens and masking out the context. Our experiments
demonstrate that models trained with CINGS exhibit stronger grounding in both
textual and visual domains compared to standard instruction-tuned models. In
the text domain, CINGS outperforms other training methods across 11
information-seeking datasets and is complementary to inference-time grounding
techniques. In the vision-language domain, replacing a vision-language model's
LLM backbone with a CINGS-trained model reduces hallucinations across four
benchmarks and maintains factual consistency throughout the generated response.
This improved grounding comes without degradation in general downstream
performance. Finally, we analyze the mechanism underlying the enhanced
grounding in CINGS and find that it induces a shift in the model's prior
knowledge and behavior, implicitly encouraging greater reliance on the external
context.

*Md Imbesat Hassan Rizvi,Xiaodan Zhu,Iryna Gurevych*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPARE, a framework for efficient and high-quality automated process supervision, improving reasoning tasks across multiple domains with reduced computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for process or step-wise supervision in LLMs face challenges with efficient and high-quality automated annotation of multi-step reasoning tasks.

Method: The SPARE framework aligns each reasoning step to a reference solution with explicit reasoning for evaluation. It is applied to datasets in various reasoning domains, enabling fine-tuning and reward model training for improved performance.

Result: SPARE outperforms baseline methods, improving reasoning capabilities in multi-domain datasets, offering 2.6x efficiency improvements, and reducing runtime to 38% of tree search-based methods.

Conclusion: SPARE provides an effective, scalable, and efficient alternative for process-level supervision and evaluation in LLMs. It facilitates better reasoning and generalization with a publicly available codebase for research and reproducibility.

Abstract: Process or step-wise supervision has played a crucial role in advancing
complex multi-step reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, efficient, high-quality automated process annotation remains a
significant challenge. To address this, we introduce Single-Pass Annotation
with Reference-Guided Evaluation (SPARE), a novel structured framework that
enables single-pass, per-step annotation by aligning each solution step to one
or multiple steps in a reference solution, accompanied by explicit reasoning
for evaluation. We show that reference-guided step-level evaluation effectively
facilitates process supervision on four datasets spanning three domains:
mathematical reasoning, multi-hop compositional question answering, and spatial
reasoning. We demonstrate that SPARE, when compared to baselines, improves
reasoning performance when used for: (1) fine-tuning models in an offline RL
setup for inference-time greedy-decoding, and (2) training reward models for
ranking/aggregating multiple LLM-generated outputs. Additionally, SPARE
achieves competitive performance on challenging mathematical datasets while
offering 2.6 times greater efficiency, requiring only 38% of the runtime,
compared to tree search-based automatic annotation. The codebase, along with a
trained SPARE-PRM model, is publicly released to facilitate further research
and reproducibility.

### [48] [Enhancing Hyperbole and Metaphor Detection with Their Bidirectional Dynamic Interaction and Emotion Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15504)
*Li Zheng,Sihang Wang,Hao Fei,Zuquan Peng,Fei Li,Jianming Fu,Chong Teng,Donghong Ji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EmoBi, an emotion-guided framework, substantially improves hyperbole and metaphor detection with F1 score gains of up to 28.1% over SoTA models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of identifying hyperbole and metaphor due to their semantic obscurity and expressive diversity, and to leverage implicit emotional cues for better detection.

Method: The proposed method, EmoBi, includes an emotion analysis module to mine emotional connotations, an emotion-based domain mapping module for understanding implicit meanings, and a bidirectional dynamic interaction module for mutual enhancements of hyperbole and metaphor detection. A verification mechanism ensures accuracy.

Result: EmoBi achieved significant performance improvements on four datasets, notably increasing the F1 score by 28.1% for hyperbole detection on the TroFi dataset and 23.1% for metaphor detection on the HYPO-L dataset compared to current SoTA approaches.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that emotion-guided and bidirectional dynamic interaction mechanisms are highly effective strategies for improving hyperbole and metaphor detection in text-based NLP tasks.

Abstract: Text-based hyperbole and metaphor detection are of great significance for
natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, due to their semantic
obscurity and expressive diversity, it is rather challenging to identify them.
Existing methods mostly focus on superficial text features, ignoring the
associations of hyperbole and metaphor as well as the effect of implicit
emotion on perceiving these rhetorical devices. To implement these hypotheses,
we propose an emotion-guided hyperbole and metaphor detection framework based
on bidirectional dynamic interaction (EmoBi). Firstly, the emotion analysis
module deeply mines the emotion connotations behind hyperbole and metaphor.
Next, the emotion-based domain mapping module identifies the target and source
domains to gain a deeper understanding of the implicit meanings of hyperbole
and metaphor. Finally, the bidirectional dynamic interaction module enables the
mutual promotion between hyperbole and metaphor. Meanwhile, a verification
mechanism is designed to ensure detection accuracy and reliability. Experiments
show that EmoBi outperforms all baseline methods on four datasets.
Specifically, compared to the current SoTA, the F1 score increased by 28.1% for
hyperbole detection on the TroFi dataset and 23.1% for metaphor detection on
the HYPO-L dataset. These results, underpinned by in-depth analyses, underscore
the effectiveness and potential of our approach for advancing hyperbole and
metaphor detection.

*Shang Hong Sim,Tej Deep Pala,Vernon Toh,Hai Leong Chieu,Amir Zadeh,Chuan Li,Navonil Majumder,Soujanya Poria*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores improving grounded and trustworthy responses in large language models (LLMs) using reinforcement learning (GRPO) and reasoning, yielding better performance on QA tasks with citation sufficiency and strong refusal handling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the shortcomings of instruction-tuned LLMs in generating grounded, trustworthy responses, especially failures like citation inaccuracies or ungrounded refusals, and to enhance their reliability.

Method: The authors employed reinforcement learning, specifically GRPO, to optimize for answer correctness, citation sufficiency, and refusal quality without requiring annotated reasoning traces. They also introduced a two-stage training process for stable learning signals and revisited GPT-4 distillation for strengthening instruction tuning.

Result: Extensive evaluations across ASQA, QAMPARI, ELI5, and ExpertQA datasets demonstrated significant improvements in grounding and performance when incorporating reasoning and stage-wise optimization, particularly for unanswerable queries and well-cited responses.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning, reasoning mechanisms, and stage-wise optimization are effective strategies for improving the verifiability and reliability of LLMs, addressing key challenges in grounded response generation.

Abstract: Generating grounded and trustworthy responses remains a key challenge for
large language models (LLMs). While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with
citation-based grounding holds promise, instruction-tuned models frequently
fail even in straightforward scenarios: missing explicitly stated answers,
citing incorrectly, or refusing when evidence is available. In this work, we
explore how reinforcement learning (RL) and internal reasoning can enhance
grounding in LLMs. We use the GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) method
to train models using verifiable outcome-based rewards targeting answer
correctness, citation sufficiency, and refusal quality, without requiring gold
reasoning traces or expensive annotations. Through comprehensive experiments
across ASQA, QAMPARI, ELI5, and ExpertQA we show that reasoning-augmented
models significantly outperform instruction-only variants, especially in
handling unanswerable queries and generating well-cited responses. A two-stage
training setup, first optimizing answer and citation behavior and then refusal,
further improves grounding by stabilizing the learning signal. Additionally, we
revisit instruction tuning via GPT-4 distillation and find that combining it
with GRPO enhances performance on long-form, generative QA tasks. Overall, our
findings highlight the value of reasoning, stage-wise optimization, and
outcome-driven RL for building more verifiable and reliable LLMs.

*Bailin Wang,Chang Lan,Chong Wang,Ruoming Pang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RATTENTION proposes an innovative local-global attention mechanism that achieves a superior balance between performance and efficiency, especially in short-context scenarios, using smaller windows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the intrinsic limitation of local attention models, which ignore tokens outside their defined windows, and to improve their efficiency-performance tradeoff in both short- and long-context settings.

Method: Develop a variant called RATTENTION, which combines local attention with a linear attention mechanism to capture out-of-window tokens, alongside implementing specialized kernels for computational efficiency.

Result: RATTENTION with a small window size (e.g., 512) maintains performance comparable to full-attention models in diverse tasks, improves long-context performance, and achieves training speeds on par with state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: RATTENTION shifts the efficiency-performance Pareto frontier for local-global attention models, offering a strong alternative to standard Transformers while preserving training speed and versatility.

Abstract: Local-global attention models have recently emerged as compelling
alternatives to standard Transformers, promising improvements in both training
and inference efficiency. However, the crucial choice of window size presents a
Pareto tradeoff: larger windows maintain performance akin to full attention but
offer minimal efficiency gains in short-context scenarios, while smaller
windows can lead to performance degradation. Current models, such as Gemma2 and
Mistral, adopt conservative window sizes (e.g., 4096 out of an 8192 pretraining
length) to preserve performance. This work investigates strategies to shift
this Pareto frontier, enabling local-global models to achieve efficiency gains
even in short-context regimes. Our core motivation is to address the intrinsic
limitation of local attention -- its complete disregard for tokens outside the
defined window. We explore RATTENTION, a variant of local attention integrated
with a specialized linear attention mechanism designed to capture information
from these out-of-window tokens. Pretraining experiments at the 3B and 12B
scales demonstrate that RATTENTION achieves a superior Pareto tradeoff between
performance and efficiency. As a sweet spot, RATTENTION with a window size of
just 512 consistently matches the performance of full-attention models across
diverse settings. Furthermore, the recurrent nature inherent in the linear
attention component of RATTENTION contributes to enhanced long-context
performance, as validated on the RULER benchmark. Crucially, these improvements
do not compromise training efficiency; thanks to a specialized kernel
implementation and the reduced window size, RATTENTION maintains training
speeds comparable to existing state-of-the-art approaches.

*John X. Morris,Junjie Oscar Yin,Woojeong Kim,Vitaly Shmatikov,Alexander M. Rush*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a gradient-based method to approximate training data from the weights of language models, recovering useful data and significantly improving performance metrics even when no original training data is known.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and recovering model training data is crucial, especially for transparency and reproducibility in highly impactful models that do not share their training datasets.

Method: The authors designed a gradient-based mechanism to match high-relevance data from public corpora to approximate the original training data by comparing the weights of the baseline and finetuned models.

Result: Their method successfully recovered close-to-original performance on tasks such as AG News classification (improving accuracy to 80%) and SFT on a document set (perplexity reduced from 3.3 to 2.3).

Conclusion: The proposed approach enables effective recovery of model performance using publicly available data, bridging gaps in transparency and enabling further use of closed-data models.

Abstract: Modern language models often have open weights but closed training data. We
formalize the problem of data approximation from model weights and propose
several baselines and metrics. We develop a gradient-based approach that
selects the highest-matching data from a large public text corpus and show its
effectiveness at recovering useful data given only weights of the original and
finetuned models. Even when none of the true training data is known, our method
is able to locate a small subset of public Web documents can be used to train a
model to close to the original model performance given models trained for both
classification and supervised-finetuning. On the AG News classification task,
our method improves performance from 65% (using randomly selected data) to 80%,
approaching the expert benchmark of 88%. When applied to a model trained with
SFT on MSMARCO web documents, our method reduces perplexity from 3.3 to 2.3,
compared to an expert LLAMA model's perplexity of 2.0.

*Shufan Li,Aditya Grover*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework named PredGen to minimize latency in using Large Language Models (LLMs) with text-to-speech systems, halving delays in real-time applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the high latency issues in real-time voice assistants when LLMs are used on devices with limited computing power, adversely affecting user experience.

Method: The proposed PredGen framework uses speculative decoding during user input to pre-generate responses, allowing TTS processes to start with minimal delay.

Result: PredGen achieves a 2x reduction in latency on the Lmsys and MT-Bench datasets without significantly increasing computational costs.

Conclusion: Speculative decoding via PredGen effectively mitigates LLM-induced latency in voice applications, improving responsiveness while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in real-time voice chat
applications, typically in combination with text-to-speech (TTS) systems to
generate audio responses. However, their large size often leads to noticeable
latency between the end of user input and the start of audio output, resulting
in suboptimal user experiences. This latency is particularly evident when LLMs
are deployed as single-user voice assistants on consumer-grade hardware with
limited computing capacity. We discovered that this latency is primarily
dominated by the time it takes for the LLMs to generate the first sentence,
which is required as input by the TTS systems that synthesize audio responses
on a sentence-by-sentence basis. To address this bottleneck, we propose
Predictive Generation (PredGen), a novel framework that mitigates-or even
eliminates-this delay through speculative decoding at input time. PredGen
generates candidate responses while the user is still speaking, enabling the
system to begin TTS processing with minimal delay. Simulated experiments on the
Lmsys and MT-Bench datasets show that the proposed method can effectively
reduce the latency by around 2x across a wide range of use cases, while
incurring only minimal additional computation cost at input time-computation
that would otherwise go unused.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a metric, Gender Inclusivity Fairness Index (GIFI), to assess how well large language models (LLMs) handle binary and non-binary genders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of comprehensive studies evaluating LLMs' inclusivity toward non-binary genders in addition to binary genders.

Method: The study develops the GIFI metric, involving various evaluation levels from probing gender pronouns to testing cognitive behaviors, and applies it to 22 LLMs.

Result: Significant differences in gender inclusivity were observed among the 22 LLMs evaluated, showcasing varied performance in handling genders.

Conclusion: The research emphasizes the necessity of improving LLM gender inclusivity and establishes GIFI as a benchmark for progress in this field.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of gender fairness in large language
models (LLMs), focusing on their ability to handle both binary and non-binary
genders. While previous studies primarily focus on binary gender distinctions,
we introduce the Gender Inclusivity Fairness Index (GIFI), a novel and
comprehensive metric that quantifies the diverse gender inclusivity of LLMs.
GIFI consists of a wide range of evaluations at different levels, from simply
probing the model with respect to provided gender pronouns to testing various
aspects of model generation and cognitive behaviors under different gender
assumptions, revealing biases associated with varying gender identifiers. We
conduct extensive evaluations with GIFI on 22 prominent open-source and
proprietary LLMs of varying sizes and capabilities, discovering significant
variations in LLMs' gender inclusivity. Our study highlights the importance of
improving LLMs' inclusivity, providing a critical benchmark for future
advancements in gender fairness in generative models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to create a benchmark specifically tailored for assessing how foundation models perform in verifying multimodal scientific claims, a critical aspect in the context of scientific literature.

Method: The authors introduced SciVer, a dataset of 3,000 expert-annotated examples across 1,113 papers and evaluated 21 cutting-edge multimodal foundation models, conducting performance analysis and error evaluations.

Result: The evaluated models exhibited a significant performance gap compared to human experts, with weaknesses highlighted through retrieval-augmented generation and error analysis.

Conclusion: Current foundation models struggle with multimodal claim verification in scientific contexts; the findings provide directions for improving model reasoning and comprehension.

Abstract: We introduce SciVer, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate
the ability of foundation models to verify claims within a multimodal
scientific context. SciVer consists of 3,000 expert-annotated examples over
1,113 scientific papers, covering four subsets, each representing a common
reasoning type in multimodal scientific claim verification. To enable
fine-grained evaluation, each example includes expert-annotated supporting
evidence. We assess the performance of 21 state-of-the-art multimodal
foundation models, including o4-mini, Gemini-2.5-Flash, Llama-3.2-Vision, and
Qwen2.5-VL. Our experiment reveals a substantial performance gap between these
models and human experts on SciVer. Through an in-depth analysis of
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and human-conducted error evaluations, we
identify critical limitations in current open-source models, offering key
insights to advance models' comprehension and reasoning in multimodal

### [55] [DiscoSG: Towards Discourse-Level Text Scene Graph Parsing through Iterative Graph Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15583)
*Shaoqing Lin,Chong Teng,Fei Li,Donghong Ji,Lizhen Qu,Zhuang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DiscoSG, a task for creating discourse-level text scene graphs from multi-sentence captions, and proposes the DiscoSG-Refiner method, which improves efficiency and performance while addressing the challenges in existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text scene graph parsing approaches struggle with multi-sentence inputs and cross-sentence coreference, leading to performance issues in visual-language models (VLMs). The paper aims to tackle these challenges by developing a new dataset and parsing method.

Method: The authors introduce DiscoSG-DS, a dataset with multi-sentence captions paired with detailed scene graphs, and propose DiscoSG-Refiner, a two-step method that incrementally refines scene graphs using two lightweight PLMs.

Result: The DiscoSG-Refiner method achieves a 30% improvement in SPICE scores over baselines, offers 86 times faster inference compared to GPT-4, and enhances downstream tasks such as caption evaluation and hallucination detection.

Conclusion: DiscoSG-Refiner effectively balances efficiency and accuracy for discourse-level scene graph parsing, making it a practical open-source solution. The method advances graph-based understanding for multi-sentence captions in VLMs.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) now generate discourse-level, multi-sentence
visual descriptions, challenging text scene graph parsers originally designed
for single-sentence caption-to-graph mapping. Current approaches typically
merge sentence-level parsing outputs for discourse input, often missing
phenomena like cross-sentence coreference, resulting in fragmented graphs and
degraded downstream VLM task performance. To address this, we introduce a new
task, Discourse-level text Scene Graph parsing (DiscoSG), supported by our
dataset DiscoSG-DS, which comprises 400 expert-annotated and 8,430 synthesised
multi-sentence caption-graph pairs for images. Each caption averages 9
sentences, and each graph contains at least 3 times more triples than those in
existing datasets. While fine-tuning large PLMs (i.e., GPT-4) on DiscoSG-DS
improves SPICE by approximately 48% over the best sentence-merging baseline,
high inference cost and restrictive licensing hinder its open-source use, and
smaller fine-tuned PLMs struggle with complex graphs. We propose
DiscoSG-Refiner, which drafts a base graph using one small PLM, then employs a
second PLM to iteratively propose graph edits, reducing full-graph generation
overhead. Using two Flan-T5-Base models, DiscoSG-Refiner still improves SPICE
by approximately 30% over the best baseline while achieving 86 times faster
inference than GPT-4. It also consistently improves downstream VLM tasks like
discourse-level caption evaluation and hallucination detection. Code and data

TL;DR: The paper introduces WikiMixQA, a benchmark for evaluating multi-modal cross-modal reasoning, focusing on tables and charts in documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models face significant challenges in processing complex document layouts and performing reasoning with long contexts.

Method: They developed WikiMixQA with 1,000 multiple-choice questions based on tables and charts from 4,000 Wikipedia pages across diverse topics.

Result: Proprietary models achieved up to ~70% accuracy with direct context but struggled significantly in a long-document retrieval setting. Open-source models performed much worse, peaking at 27% accuracy.

Conclusion: WikiMixQA highlights gaps in multi-modal reasoning across long contexts, making it a key resource for enhancing document understanding advancements.

Abstract: Documents are fundamental to preserving and disseminating information, often
incorporating complex layouts, tables, and charts that pose significant
challenges for automatic document understanding (DU). While vision-language
large models (VLLMs) have demonstrated improvements across various tasks, their
effectiveness in processing long-context vision inputs remains unclear. This
paper introduces WikiMixQA, a benchmark comprising 1,000 multiple-choice
questions (MCQs) designed to evaluate cross-modal reasoning over tables and
charts extracted from 4,000 Wikipedia pages spanning seven distinct topics.
Unlike existing benchmarks, WikiMixQA emphasizes complex reasoning by requiring
models to synthesize information from multiple modalities. We evaluate 12
state-of-the-art vision-language models, revealing that while proprietary
models achieve ~70% accuracy when provided with direct context, their
performance deteriorates significantly when retrieval from long documents is
required. Among these, GPT-4-o is the only model exceeding 50% accuracy in this
setting, whereas open-source models perform considerably worse, with a maximum
accuracy of 27%. These findings underscore the challenges of long-context,
multi-modal reasoning and establish WikiMixQA as a crucial benchmark for
advancing document understanding research.

### [57] [From Model to Classroom: Evaluating Generated MCQs for Portuguese with Narrative and Difficulty Concerns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15598)
*Bernardo Leite,Henrique Lopes Cardoso,Pedro Pinto,Abel Ferreira,Luís Abreu,Isabel Rangel,Sandra Monteiro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates generative AI models for creating curriculum-relevant Portuguese MCQs, finding their quality akin to human-generated ones but identifying issues with semantics, answerability, and distractor quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual creation of MCQs with varied difficulty and targeting specific skills is time-intensive and expensive. Generative AI offers automation opportunities, but quality assessment, especially for non-English languages like Portuguese, remains underexplored.

Method: The study applied generative AI models to create MCQs in Portuguese for narrative reading comprehension. These MCQs were then reviewed by experts and analyzed using student responses to evaluate psychometric properties.

Result: The generated MCQs matched the quality of human-authored ones, but issues were noted regarding semantic clarity, answerability, and the design of engaging and high-quality distractors.

Conclusion: Generative AI shows promise in Portuguese MCQ generation for elementary contexts, but improvements are needed in clarity, answerability, and distractor construction to enhance their reliability and effectiveness.

Abstract: While MCQs are valuable for learning and evaluation, manually creating them
with varying difficulty levels and targeted reading skills remains a
time-consuming and costly task. Recent advances in generative AI provide an
opportunity to automate MCQ generation efficiently. However, assessing the
actual quality and reliability of generated MCQs has received limited attention
-- particularly regarding cases where generation fails. This aspect becomes
particularly important when the generated MCQs are meant to be applied in
real-world settings. Additionally, most MCQ generation studies focus on
English, leaving other languages underexplored. This paper investigates the
capabilities of current generative models in producing MCQs for reading
comprehension in Portuguese, a morphologically rich language. Our study focuses
on generating MCQs that align with curriculum-relevant narrative elements and
span different difficulty levels. We evaluate these MCQs through expert review
and by analyzing the psychometric properties extracted from student responses
to assess their suitability for elementary school students. Our results show
that current models can generate MCQs of comparable quality to human-authored
ones. However, we identify issues related to semantic clarity and
answerability. Also, challenges remain in generating distractors that engage
students and meet established criteria for high-quality MCQ option design.

*Xiangxiang Cui,Shu Yang,Tianjin Huang,Wanyu Lin,Lijie Hu,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study investigates how large language models express and process regret when challenged with contradictory evidence, proposing methods and metrics to identify regret mechanisms in neural representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the reliability of large language models by understanding how regret is expressed and cognitively encoded in their neural networks.

Method: The authors propose creating a dataset for regret expressions through tailored scenarios, developing two metrics (S-CDI and RDS) to identify optimal regret layers and neurons, and using GIC to analyze neuron activation patterns.

Result: Experimental results identified optimal regret representation layers using the S-CDI metric, observed an M-shaped alternation in information processing, and categorized neurons into three groups based on their functions.

Conclusion: The study advances understanding of regret mechanisms in language models by providing tools to identify and analyze regret expressions, improving model performance and cognition interpretability.

Abstract: Regret in Large Language Models refers to their explicit regret expression
when presented with evidence contradicting their previously generated
misinformation. Studying the regret mechanism is crucial for enhancing model
reliability and helps in revealing how cognition is coded in neural networks.
To understand this mechanism, we need to first identify regret expressions in
model outputs, then analyze their internal representation. This analysis
requires examining the model's hidden states, where information processing
occurs at the neuron level. However, this faces three key challenges: (1) the
absence of specialized datasets capturing regret expressions, (2) the lack of
metrics to find the optimal regret representation layer, and (3) the lack of
metrics for identifying and analyzing regret neurons. Addressing these
limitations, we propose: (1) a workflow for constructing a comprehensive regret
dataset through strategically designed prompting scenarios, (2) the Supervised
Compression-Decoupling Index (S-CDI) metric to identify optimal regret
representation layers, and (3) the Regret Dominance Score (RDS) metric to
identify regret neurons and the Group Impact Coefficient (GIC) to analyze
activation patterns. Our experimental results successfully identified the
optimal regret representation layer using the S-CDI metric, which significantly
enhanced performance in probe classification experiments. Additionally, we
discovered an M-shaped decoupling pattern across model layers, revealing how
information processing alternates between coupling and decoupling phases.
Through the RDS metric, we categorized neurons into three distinct functional
groups: regret neurons, non-regret neurons, and dual neurons.

*Yuka Machino,Matthias Hofer,Max Siegel,Joshua B. Tenenbaum,Robert D. Hawkins*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper studies misunderstandings in cross-cultural communication by examining how British and American English speakers interpret intensifiers like "quite" and "very."


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to clarify whether cross-cultural misunderstandings arise from literal word meanings or broader pragmatic factors like politeness and brevity.

Method: The research employs three experiments and a computational cognitive model to investigate how listeners balance informativity, politeness, and utterance cost.

Result: The study finds that cross-cultural differences stem from a mix of distinct literal meanings and varying weights on utterance cost.

Conclusion: Cross-cultural interpretation differences result from the intricate interplay of semantic and pragmatic factors, challenging purely semantic or politeness-based explanations.

Abstract: Misunderstandings in cross-cultural communication often arise from subtle
differences in interpretation, but it is unclear whether these differences
arise from the literal meanings assigned to words or from more general
pragmatic factors such as norms around politeness and brevity. In this paper,
we report three experiments examining how speakers of British and American
English interpret intensifiers like "quite" and "very." To better understand
these cross-cultural differences, we developed a computational cognitive model
where listeners recursively reason about speakers who balance informativity,
politeness, and utterance cost. Our model comparisons suggested that
cross-cultural differences in intensifier interpretation stem from a
combination of (1) different literal meanings, (2) different weights on
utterance cost. These findings challenge accounts based purely on semantic
variation or politeness norms, demonstrating that cross-cultural differences in
interpretation emerge from an intricate interplay between the two.

### [60] [Revisiting Compositional Generalization Capability of Large Language Models Considering Instruction Following Ability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15629)
*Yusuke Sakai,Hidetaka Kamigaito,Taro Watanabe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Ordered CommonGen introduces a benchmark to test LLMs on instruction compliance and compositional reasoning, focusing on concept order generation, with most models showing only partial success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate if generative LLMs can follow specified concept orders in their generated sentences, combining instruction-following abilities with compositional generalization.

Method: Introduced Ordered CommonGen benchmark to measure ordered coverage, evaluated 36 LLMs on instruction compliance, and analyzed their ability to adhere to concept orders.

Result: Most LLMs demonstrated biases in concept order, resulting in repetitive patterns and partial compliance, with top performance showing only 75% ordered coverage.

Conclusion: LLMs require improvement in both understanding instructions and generating diverse sentences that adhere strictly to concept order.

Abstract: In generative commonsense reasoning tasks such as CommonGen, generative large
language models (LLMs) compose sentences that include all given concepts.
However, when focusing on instruction-following capabilities, if a prompt
specifies a concept order, LLMs must generate sentences that adhere to the
specified order. To address this, we propose Ordered CommonGen, a benchmark
designed to evaluate the compositional generalization and instruction-following
abilities of LLMs. This benchmark measures ordered coverage to assess whether
concepts are generated in the specified order, enabling a simultaneous
evaluation of both abilities. We conducted a comprehensive analysis using 36
LLMs and found that, while LLMs generally understand the intent of
instructions, biases toward specific concept order patterns often lead to
low-diversity outputs or identical results even when the concept order is
altered. Moreover, even the most instruction-compliant LLM achieved only about
75% ordered coverage, highlighting the need for improvements in both
instruction-following and compositional generalization capabilities.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates machine learning methods for Romanian authorship attribution using character n-gram features, achieving top performance with Artificial Neural Networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore authorship attribution techniques for Romanian texts using lightweight and interpretable methods in under-studied language settings.

Method: Six machine learning techniques are systematically assessed with character n-gram features from the ROST corpus to classify authorship.

Result: Artificial Neural Networks provided the highest accuracy, achieving perfect classification in some runs with 5-gram features.

Conclusion: Stylometric features combined with machine learning can deliver effective results for resource-constrained or less-studied languages, rivaling complex approaches.

Abstract: This study addresses the problem of authorship attribution for Romanian texts
using the ROST corpus, a standard benchmark in the field. We systematically
evaluate six machine learning techniques: Support Vector Machine (SVM),
Logistic Regression (LR), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Decision Trees (DT),
Random Forests (RF), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), employing character
n-gram features for classification. Among these, the ANN model achieved the
highest performance, including perfect classification in four out of fifteen
runs when using 5-gram features. These results demonstrate that lightweight,
interpretable character n-gram approaches can deliver state-of-the-art accuracy
for Romanian authorship attribution, rivaling more complex methods. Our
findings highlight the potential of simple stylometric features in resource,
constrained or under-studied language settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes Cohort-based Consistency Learning (CC-Learn), a reinforcement learning framework to enhance reasoning consistency in LLMs by training them on cohorts of similar questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Solve reasoning inconsistencies and robustness issues in large language models (LLMs).

Method: Introduces CC-Learn, uses reinforcement learning with cohort-level consistency objectives combining cohort accuracy, retrieval bonuses, and rejection penalties.

Result: CC-Learn improves accuracy and reasoning stability in LLMs on challenging reasoning benchmarks compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: Cohort-level reinforcement learning effectively improves reasoning consistency in large language models.

Abstract: Large language models excel at many tasks but still struggle with consistent,
robust reasoning. We introduce Cohort-based Consistency Learning (CC-Learn), a
reinforcement learning framework that improves the reliability of LLM reasoning
by training on cohorts of similar questions derived from shared programmatic
abstractions. To enforce cohort-level consistency, we define a composite
objective combining cohort accuracy, a retrieval bonus for effective problem
decomposition, and a rejection penalty for trivial or invalid lookups that
reinforcement learning can directly optimize, unlike supervised fine-tuning.
Optimizing this reward guides the model to adopt uniform reasoning patterns
across all cohort members. Experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks
(including ARC-Challenge and StrategyQA) show that CC-Learn boosts both
accuracy and reasoning stability over pretrained and SFT baselines. These
results demonstrate that cohort-level RL effectively enhances reasoning
consistency in LLMs.

*Tommaso Green,Martin Gubri,Haritz Puerto,Sangdoo Yun,Seong Joon Oh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study investigates privacy risks in reasoning traces of AI models used as personal agents, showing that traces can contain sensitive data prone to leakage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether reasoning traces, often thought to be secure and internal, pose privacy risks by potentially exposing sensitive user data.

Method: Used probing and agentic evaluations to assess the privacy implications of test-time compute approaches, focusing on reasoning steps and verbosity.

Result: Found that while increased reasoning steps improve model caution, they also expand verbosity and potentially leak private data.

Conclusion: Privacy risks are amplified in verbose reasoning; safety measures should address internal reasoning, not just final outputs.

Abstract: We study privacy leakage in the reasoning traces of large reasoning models
used as personal agents. Unlike final outputs, reasoning traces are often
assumed to be internal and safe. We challenge this assumption by showing that
reasoning traces frequently contain sensitive user data, which can be extracted
via prompt injections or accidentally leak into outputs. Through probing and
agentic evaluations, we demonstrate that test-time compute approaches,
particularly increased reasoning steps, amplify such leakage. While increasing
the budget of those test-time compute approaches makes models more cautious in
their final answers, it also leads them to reason more verbosely and leak more
in their own thinking. This reveals a core tension: reasoning improves utility
but enlarges the privacy attack surface. We argue that safety efforts must
extend to the model's internal thinking, not just its outputs.

*Hillary Dawkins,Isar Nejadgholi,Chi-kiu Lo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines how well 21 machine translation systems preserve gender neutrality during translation from English to grammatical gender languages, finding a general lack of gender-neutral translations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensure machine translation systems address gender ambiguity to avoid misgendering and harmful stereotypes, particularly in translations into grammatical gender languages.

Method: Analyzed 21 MT systems across three translation directions, observing their handling of gender ambiguity, and categorized the gender-neutral strategies employed.

Result: Most MT systems fail to maintain gender neutrality in cases of gender ambiguity, although a few employ specific gender-neutral strategies depending on the target language.

Conclusion: Current machine translation systems need improvement in handling gender neutrality, as they largely fail to address gender ambiguity effectively.

Abstract: Gender-inclusive machine translation (MT) should preserve gender ambiguity in
the source to avoid misgendering and representational harms. While gender
ambiguity often occurs naturally in notional gender languages such as English,
maintaining that gender neutrality in grammatical gender languages is a
challenge. Here we assess the sensitivity of 21 MT systems to the need for
gender neutrality in response to gender ambiguity in three translation
directions of varying difficulty. The specific gender-neutral strategies that
are observed in practice are categorized and discussed. Additionally, we
examine the effect of binary gender stereotypes on the use of gender-neutral
translation. In general, we report a disappointing absence of gender-neutral
translations in response to gender ambiguity. However, we observe a small
handful of MT systems that switch to gender neutral translation using specific
strategies, depending on the target language.

*Byung-Kwan Lee,Ryo Hachiuma,Yong Man Ro,Yu-Chiang Frank Wang,Yueh-Hua Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces GenRecal, a distillation framework to enhance knowledge transfer across varied vision-language models (VLMs) with heterogeneous architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of deploying computationally demanding large vision-language models (VLMs) on resource-constrained devices and the diversity of VLM architectures.

Method: Propose a framework named GenRecal with a Recalibrator that adapts feature representations to enable efficient distillation between heterogeneous VLMs.

Result: Experiments show GenRecal improves baseline performances and surpasses both open-source and closed-source large-scale VLMs on benchmarks.

Conclusion: GenRecal enhances performance and efficiency across diverse VLM architectures, enabling practical deployment and effective knowledge transfer.

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have leveraged large
language models (LLMs) to achieve performance on par with closed-source systems
like GPT-4V. However, deploying these models in real-world scenarios,
particularly on resource-constrained devices, remains challenging due to their
substantial computational demands. This has spurred interest in distilling
knowledge from large VLMs into smaller, more efficient counterparts. A key
challenge arises here from the diversity of VLM architectures, which are built
on different LLMs and employ varying token types-differing in vocabulary size,
token splits, and token index ordering. To address this challenge of limitation
to a specific VLM type, we present Generation after Recalibration (GenRecal), a
novel, general-purpose distillation framework for VLMs. GenRecal incorporates a
Recalibrator that aligns and adapts feature representations between
heterogeneous VLMs, enabling effective knowledge transfer across different
types of VLMs. Through extensive experiments on multiple challenging
benchmarks, we demonstrate that GenRecal significantly improves baseline
performances, eventually outperforming large-scale open- and closed-source
VLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PhantomHunter is introduced to detect text from privately-tuned large language models, outperforming other methods with over 96% F1 scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of private LLM tuning has led to challenges in detecting LLM-generated text, crucial for mitigating societal issues such as misinformation and academic misconduct.

Method: The paper proposes PhantomHunter, which uses a family-aware learning framework to capture shared traits within LLM base models and their derivatives, addressing detection challenges posed by unseen privately-tuned models.

Result: PhantomHunter outperformed existing detectors and industry standards, achieving high F1 scores exceeding 96% in tests on LLaMA, Gemma, and Mistral families.

Conclusion: PhantomHunter demonstrates significant capability in detecting text from privately-tuned LLMs, offering a robust solution for addressing emerging detection challenges.

Abstract: With the popularity of large language models (LLMs), undesirable societal
problems like misinformation production and academic misconduct have been more
severe, making LLM-generated text detection now of unprecedented importance.
Although existing methods have made remarkable progress, a new challenge posed
by text from privately tuned LLMs remains underexplored. Users could easily
possess private LLMs by fine-tuning an open-source one with private corpora,
resulting in a significant performance drop of existing detectors in practice.
To address this issue, we propose PhantomHunter, an LLM-generated text detector
specialized for detecting text from unseen, privately-tuned LLMs. Its
family-aware learning framework captures family-level traits shared across the
base models and their derivatives, instead of memorizing individual
characteristics. Experiments on data from LLaMA, Gemma, and Mistral families
show its superiority over 7 baselines and 3 industrial services, with F1 scores
of over 96%.

TL;DR: ViLLa is a neuro-symbolic system designed for interpretable animal monitoring by integrating visual detection, natural language parsing, and logic-based reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a modular and transparent system for animal monitoring that can interpret visual data in relation to human language queries in natural environments.

Method: ViLLa combines a visual detection module for identifying animals, a language parser for understanding queries, and a symbolic reasoning layer for logical inference to answer predefined queries.

Result: The system accurately answers questions about animal counts, presence, or locations by grounding detections into symbolic facts and using rules-based reasoning.

Conclusion: ViLLa demonstrates effective bridging of visual animal imagery with human language queries, emphasizing modularity and interpretability over black-box approaches.

Abstract: Monitoring animal populations in natural environments requires systems that
can interpret both visual data and human language queries. This work introduces
ViLLa (Vision-Language-Logic Approach), a neuro-symbolic framework designed for
interpretable animal monitoring. ViLLa integrates three core components: a
visual detection module for identifying animals and their spatial locations in
images, a language parser for understanding natural language queries, and a
symbolic reasoning layer that applies logic-based inference to answer those
queries. Given an image and a question such as "How many dogs are in the
scene?" or "Where is the buffalo?", the system grounds visual detections into
symbolic facts and uses predefined rules to compute accurate answers related to
count, presence, and location. Unlike end-to-end black-box models, ViLLa
separates perception, understanding, and reasoning, offering modularity and
transparency. The system was evaluated on a range of animal imagery tasks and
demonstrates the ability to bridge visual content with structured,
human-interpretable queries.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new framework, GraphGSOcc, for improving 3D semantic occupancy prediction in autonomous driving by addressing limitations in feature aggregation and boundary ambiguities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the accuracy and efficiency of 3D semantic occupancy prediction in autonomous driving by addressing semantic correlation handling and boundary ambiguity challenges in existing 3D Gaussian Splating methods.

Method: The paper proposes the GraphGSOcc model, incorporating a Dual Gaussians Graph Attention mechanism with geometric and semantic graph structures. It uses adaptive KNN search radii for geometric consistency and cosine similarity to encode semantic relationships. Multi-scale Graph Attention is applied to optimize boundary details at lower layers and object-level topology at higher layers.

Result: The method achieves a mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) of 24.10% on the SurroundOcc dataset, improves mIoU by 1.97%, and reduces GPU memory usage by 13.7% compared to the prior GaussianWorld approach.

Conclusion: GraphGSOcc effectively addresses feature aggregation and boundary ambiguity issues in 3D Gaussian Splating, offering improved performance and efficiency for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Addressing the task of 3D semantic occupancy prediction for autonomous
driving, we tackle two key issues in existing 3D Gaussian Splating (3DGS)
methods: (1) unified feature aggregation neglecting semantic correlations among
similar categories and across regions, and (2) boundary ambiguities caused by
the lack of geometric constraints in MLP iterative optimization. We propose the
GraphGSOcc model, a novel framework that combines semantic and geometric graph
Transformer for 3D Gaussian Splating-based Occupancy Prediction. We propose the
Dual Gaussians Graph Attenntion, which dynamically constructs dual graph
structures: a geometric graph adaptively calculating KNN search radii based on
Gaussian poses, enabling large-scale Gaussians to aggregate features from
broader neighborhoods while compact Gaussians focus on local geometric
consistency; a semantic graph retaining top-M highly correlated nodes via
cosine similarity to explicitly encode semantic relationships within and across
instances. Coupled with the Multi-scale Graph Attention framework, fine-grained
attention at lower layers optimizes boundary details, while coarse-grained
attention at higher layers models object-level topology. Experiments on the
SurroundOcc dataset achieve an mIoU of 24.10%, reducing GPU memory to 6.1 GB,
demonstrating a 1.97% mIoU improvement and 13.7% memory reduction compared to
GaussianWorld

TL;DR: The paper introduces DAVID-X, a dataset with defect-level annotations for identifying AI-generated videos, and DAVID-XR1, an interpretable video-language model providing visual reasoning for detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With AI-generated videos becoming widespread, the content's authenticity must be verifiably distinguished to ensure trustworthiness.

Method: The authors develop DAVID-X and DAVID-XR1, pairing rich annotations with a video-language model that provides interpretable reasoning with defect categorization, spatial-temporal localization, and explanations.

Result: Their approach, utilizing a fine-tuned backbone and chain-of-thought distillation, achieves robust generalization across diverse AI video generators.

Conclusion: Explainable models, like DAVID-XR1, offer enhanced reliability and transparency in detecting synthetic content, addressing limitations in black-box methods.

Abstract: As AI-generated video becomes increasingly pervasive across media platforms,
the ability to reliably distinguish synthetic content from authentic footage
has become both urgent and essential. Existing approaches have primarily
treated this challenge as a binary classification task, offering limited
insight into where or why a model identifies a video as AI-generated. However,
the core challenge extends beyond simply detecting subtle artifacts; it
requires providing fine-grained, persuasive evidence that can convince auditors
and end-users alike. To address this critical gap, we introduce DAVID-X, the
first dataset to pair AI-generated videos with detailed defect-level,
temporal-spatial annotations and written rationales. Leveraging these rich
annotations, we present DAVID-XR1, a video-language model designed to deliver
an interpretable chain of visual reasoning-including defect categorization,
temporal-spatial localization, and natural language explanations. This approach
fundamentally transforms AI-generated video detection from an opaque black-box
decision into a transparent and verifiable diagnostic process. We demonstrate
that a general-purpose backbone, fine-tuned on our compact dataset and enhanced
with chain-of-thought distillation, achieves strong generalization across a
variety of generators and generation modes. Our results highlight the promise
of explainable detection methods for trustworthy identification of AI-generated
video content.

Motivation: To understand and objectively analyze differences between human-designed and machine-generated 3D architectural forms.

Method: Developed a dataset (ArchForms-4000) and a CNN model (ArchShapeNet) with a saliency module for classification and spatial analysis.

Result: ArchShapeNet achieved high performance metrics in form classification, surpassing human experts in accuracy, precision, and recall.

Conclusion: Human-designed forms excel in spatial and proportional qualities; insights from this research potentially improve generative design technologies.

Abstract: In contemporary architectural design, the growing complexity and diversity of

*Kiet Dang Vu,Trung Thai Tran,Duc Dung Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MonoVQD introduces novel mechanisms for enhancing DETR-based monocular 3D object detection, achieving superior results on KITTI and nuScenes benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve monocular 3D object detection performance by addressing limitations in DETR-like architectures, specifically stability in optimization, denoising inefficiencies, and query refinement.

Method: MonoVQD incorporates three main innovations: 1) Mask Separated Self-Attention for stable Hungarian matching, 2) Variational Query Denoising to resolve gradient vanishing, and 3) self-distillation for iterative query refinement.

Result: MonoVQD outperforms existing methods on KITTI and demonstrates broad applicability to multi-view detection on nuScenes.

Conclusion: The framework not only enhances monocular 3D object detection but proves adaptable for diverse architectures, displaying strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Precisely localizing 3D objects from a single image constitutes a central
challenge in monocular 3D detection. While DETR-like architectures offer a
powerful paradigm, their direct application in this domain encounters inherent
limitations, preventing optimal performance. Our work addresses these
challenges by introducing MonoVQD, a novel framework designed to fundamentally
advance DETR-based monocular 3D detection. We propose three main contributions.
First, we propose the Mask Separated Self-Attention mechanism that enables the
integration of the denoising process into a DETR architecture. This improves
the stability of Hungarian matching to achieve a consistent optimization
objective. Second, we present the Variational Query Denoising technique to
address the gradient vanishing problem of conventional denoising methods, which
severely restricts the efficiency of the denoising process. This explicitly
introduces stochastic properties to mitigate this fundamental limitation and
unlock substantial performance gains. Finally, we introduce a sophisticated
self-distillation strategy, leveraging insights from later decoder layers to
synergistically improve query quality in earlier layers, thereby amplifying the
iterative refinement process. Rigorous experimentation demonstrates that
MonoVQD achieves superior performance on the challenging KITTI monocular
benchmark. Highlighting its broad applicability, MonoVQD's core components
seamlessly integrate into other architectures, delivering significant
performance gains even in multi-view 3D detection scenarios on the nuScenes
dataset and underscoring its robust generalization capabilities.

*Chengzhi Xu,Yuyang Wang,Lai Wei,Lichao Sun,Weiran Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ChartIR, an iterative refinement method to improve chart-to-code generation using structured instructions and decomposed pipeline stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The researchers aim to overcome the limitations of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in chart-to-code generation, where precise visual understanding and structured code translation are essential.

Method: ChartIR employs two structured instructions (description and difference) for visual understanding and splits the chart generation process into two stages: initial code generation and iterative refinement.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that ChartIR surpasses existing methods, achieving better performance on both open-source and closed-source MLLM models like Qwen2-VL and GPT-4o.

Conclusion: ChartIR provides an effective solution to enhance the performance of MLLMs for chart-to-code generation, leveraging structured instructions and iterative refinement.

Abstract: Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have attracted increasing
research attention due to their powerful visual understanding capabilities.
While they have achieved impressive results on various vision tasks, their
performance on chart-to-code generation remains suboptimal. This task requires
MLLMs to generate executable code that can reproduce a given chart, demanding
not only precise visual understanding but also accurate translation of visual
elements into structured code. Directly prompting MLLMs to perform this complex
task often yields unsatisfactory results. To address this challenge, we propose
{ChartIR}, an iterative refinement method based on structured instruction.
First, we distinguish two tasks: visual understanding and code translation. To
accomplish the visual understanding component, we design two types of
structured instructions: description and difference. The description
instruction captures the visual elements of the reference chart, while the
difference instruction characterizes the discrepancies between the reference
chart and the generated chart. These instructions effectively transform visual
features into language representations, thereby facilitating the subsequent
code translation process. Second, we decompose the overall chart generation
pipeline into two stages: initial code generation and iterative refinement,
enabling progressive enhancement of the final output. Experimental results show
that, compared to other method, our method achieves superior performance on
both the open-source model Qwen2-VL and the closed-source model GPT-4o.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PictSure, an in-context learning framework for few-shot image classification, focusing on embedding models' role in improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in few-shot image classification in data-scarce domains by enhancing the effectiveness of image embeddings in in-context learning pipelines.

Method: The authors study the impact of various visual encoders, pretraining objectives, and fine-tuning strategies on few-shot classification, proposing PictSure as a framework that emphasizes embedding models.

Result: PictSure outperforms existing in-context learning models on out-of-domain benchmarks while maintaining competitive performance on in-domain tasks.

Conclusion: Embedding models' architecture and pretraining process significantly affect few-shot classification. PictSure demonstrates enhanced generalization in out-of-domain scenarios and offers a practical framework for improving FSIC.

Abstract: Building image classification models remains cumbersome in data-scarce
domains, where collecting large labeled datasets is impractical. In-context
learning (ICL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for few-shot image
classification (FSIC), enabling models to generalize across domains without
gradient-based adaptation. However, prior work has largely overlooked a
critical component of ICL-based FSIC pipelines: the role of image embeddings.
In this work, we present PictSure, an ICL framework that places the embedding
model -- its architecture, pretraining, and training dynamics -- at the center
of analysis. We systematically examine the effects of different visual encoder
types, pretraining objectives, and fine-tuning strategies on downstream FSIC
performance. Our experiments show that the training success and the
out-of-domain performance are highly dependent on how the embedding models are
pretrained. Consequently, PictSure manages to outperform existing ICL-based
FSIC models on out-of-domain benchmarks that differ significantly from the
training distribution, while maintaining comparable results on in-domain tasks.

*Shreyas Rajeev,B Sathish Babu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Best Kernel Size Estimation Function (BKSEF), a mathematical framework to determine optimal kernel sizes in CNNs, improving accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kernel size selection, a critical aspect of CNNs, has been historically overlooked despite its impact on accuracy, computational efficiency, feature extraction, and receptive field.

Method: BKSEF integrates principles from information theory, signal processing, and learning theory to optimize kernel size in a layer-wise manner.

Result: Experiments on datasets like CIFAR-10, ImageNet-lite, and ChestX-ray14 show BKSEF improves accuracy by up to 3.1% and reduces computational cost (FLOPs) by up to 42.8%.

Conclusion: BKSEF demonstrates kernel size as an optimizable parameter, providing theoretical and practical guidance for efficient CNN designs suited for various applications.

Abstract: Kernel size selection in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is a critical
but often overlooked design decision that affects receptive field, feature
extraction, computational cost, and model accuracy. This paper proposes the
Best Kernel Size Estimation Function (BKSEF), a mathematically grounded and
empirically validated framework for optimal, layer-wise kernel size
determination. BKSEF balances information gain, computational efficiency, and
accuracy improvements by integrating principles from information theory, signal
processing, and learning theory. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
ImageNet-lite, ChestX-ray14, and GTSRB datasets demonstrate that BKSEF-guided
architectures achieve up to 3.1 percent accuracy improvement and 42.8 percent
reduction in FLOPs compared to traditional models using uniform 3x3 kernels.
Two real-world case studies further validate the approach: one for medical
image classification in a cloud-based setup, and another for traffic sign
recognition on edge devices. The former achieved enhanced interpretability and
accuracy, while the latter reduced latency and model size significantly, with
minimal accuracy trade-off. These results show that kernel size can be an
active, optimizable parameter rather than a fixed heuristic. BKSEF provides
practical heuristics and theoretical support for researchers and developers
seeking efficient and application-aware CNN designs. It is suitable for
integration into neural architecture search pipelines and real-time systems,
offering a new perspective on CNN optimization.

### [78] [Efficient Retail Video Annotation: A Robust Key Frame Generation Approach for Product and Customer Interaction Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14854)
*Varun Mannam,Zhenyu Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deep learning-based method to automate video annotation for retail applications, reducing manual effort and costs while maintaining high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional video annotation is time-consuming, expensive, and prone to errors, necessitating a more efficient solution for retail applications.

Method: A deep learning framework integrating neural networks for feature embedding and object detection is proposed to automatically identify key frames and annotate retail videos.

Result: The approach achieves human-level annotation accuracy, automates 95% of the process, and offers 2x cost savings in video labeling tasks.

Conclusion: The automation of retail video annotation significantly reduces operational costs while maintaining quality, benefiting multiple retail tasks like behavior analysis and security monitoring.

Abstract: Accurate video annotation plays a vital role in modern retail applications,
including customer behavior analysis, product interaction detection, and
in-store activity recognition. However, conventional annotation methods heavily
rely on time-consuming manual labeling by human annotators, introducing
non-robust frame selection and increasing operational costs. To address these
challenges in the retail domain, we propose a deep learning-based approach that
automates key-frame identification in retail videos and provides automatic
annotations of products and customers. Our method leverages deep neural
networks to learn discriminative features by embedding video frames and
incorporating object detection-based techniques tailored for retail
environments. Experimental results showcase the superiority of our approach
over traditional methods, achieving accuracy comparable to human annotator
labeling while enhancing the overall efficiency of retail video annotation.
Remarkably, our approach leads to an average of 2 times cost savings in video
annotation. By allowing human annotators to verify/adjust less than 5% of
detected frames in the video dataset, while automating the annotation process
for the remaining frames without reducing annotation quality, retailers can
significantly reduce operational costs. The automation of key-frame detection
enables substantial time and effort savings in retail video labeling tasks,
proving highly valuable for diverse retail applications such as shopper journey
analysis, product interaction detection, and in-store security monitoring.

*Zhengquan Zhang,Feng Xu,Mengmi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents UPNet, a neural network-based approach for active view selection (AVS) in 3D object reconstruction, achieving fewer viewpoints and faster computation without compromising accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fundamental problem of minimizing the number of viewpoints needed to achieve accurate and efficient 3D object reconstruction.

Method: They propose UPNet, a lightweight feedforward neural network that predicts uncertainty maps from single input images to represent uncertainty across candidate viewpoints. It uses these maps to suppress redundant views and select the most informative viewpoints.

Result: The method achieves comparable reconstruction accuracy using half the viewpoints compared to the upper bound and significantly reduces computational overhead, including a 400x speedup and over 50% reductions in CPU, RAM, and GPU usage.

Conclusion: UPNet offers an efficient and generalizable solution for AVS, reducing resource usage while maintaining high reconstruction quality and adaptability to novel object categories.

Abstract: Some perspectives naturally provide more information than others. How can an
AI system determine which viewpoint offers the most valuable insight for
accurate and efficient 3D object reconstruction? Active view selection (AVS)
for 3D reconstruction remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. The
aim is to identify the minimal set of views that yields the most accurate 3D
reconstruction. Instead of learning radiance fields, like NeRF or 3D Gaussian
Splatting, from a current observation and computing uncertainty for each
candidate viewpoint, we introduce a novel AVS approach guided by neural
uncertainty maps predicted by a lightweight feedforward deep neural network,
named UPNet. UPNet takes a single input image of a 3D object and outputs a
predicted uncertainty map, representing uncertainty values across all possible
candidate viewpoints. By leveraging heuristics derived from observing many
natural objects and their associated uncertainty patterns, we train UPNet to
learn a direct mapping from viewpoint appearance to uncertainty in the
underlying volumetric representations. Next, our approach aggregates all
previously predicted neural uncertainty maps to suppress redundant candidate
viewpoints and effectively select the most informative one. Using these
selected viewpoints, we train 3D neural rendering models and evaluate the
quality of novel view synthesis against other competitive AVS methods.
Remarkably, despite using half of the viewpoints than the upper bound, our
method achieves comparable reconstruction accuracy. In addition, it
significantly reduces computational overhead during AVS, achieving up to a 400
times speedup along with over 50\% reductions in CPU, RAM, and GPU usage
compared to baseline methods. Notably, our approach generalizes effectively to
AVS tasks involving novel object categories, without requiring any additional
training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces DPO-Kernels for improving text-to-image (T2I) model alignment, focusing on integrating hybrid loss, kernelized representations, and enhanced divergence methods. It presents DETONATE, a large-scale benchmark for social bias analysis, and proposes a novel metric, the Alignment Quality Index (AQI).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the critical challenges of ensuring alignment, fairness, and safety in text-to-image models, considering their impact on user intent and societal biases.

Method: The paper introduces DPO-Kernels, which leverage hybrid loss, kernelized representations like RBF and Wavelet kernels, and expanded divergence measures. It also proposes DETONATE, a large-scale benchmark, and introduces the AQI metric for latent-space analysis.

Result: The proposed DPO-Kernels demonstrate improved alignment for T2I tasks with strong generalization bounds and enhanced safety. DETONATE highlights vulnerabilities related to social biases across race, gender, and disability.

Conclusion: The work enhances alignment strategies for T2I models, offering tools and benchmarks for safer and fairer image generation, while providing key insights into latent vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Alignment is crucial for text-to-image (T2I) models to ensure that generated
images faithfully capture user intent while maintaining safety and fairness.
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), prominent in large language models
(LLMs), is extending its influence to T2I systems. This paper introduces
DPO-Kernels for T2I models, a novel extension enhancing alignment across three
dimensions: (i) Hybrid Loss, integrating embedding-based objectives with
traditional probability-based loss for improved optimization; (ii) Kernelized
Representations, employing Radial Basis Function (RBF), Polynomial, and Wavelet
kernels for richer feature transformations and better separation between safe
and unsafe inputs; and (iii) Divergence Selection, expanding beyond DPO's
default Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularizer by incorporating Wasserstein and
R'enyi divergences for enhanced stability and robustness. We introduce
DETONATE, the first large-scale benchmark of its kind, comprising approximately
100K curated image pairs categorized as chosen and rejected. DETONATE
encapsulates three axes of social bias and discrimination: Race, Gender, and
Disability. Prompts are sourced from hate speech datasets, with images
generated by leading T2I models including Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large, Stable
Diffusion XL, and Midjourney. Additionally, we propose the Alignment Quality
Index (AQI), a novel geometric measure quantifying latent-space separability of
safe/unsafe image activations, revealing hidden vulnerabilities. Empirically,
we demonstrate that DPO-Kernels maintain strong generalization bounds via
Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HT-SR). DETONATE and complete code are
publicly released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents "PeRL," a reinforcement learning framework for multimodal reasoning tasks, aimed at addressing limitations of spatial reasoning in multi-image contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing multimodal reinforcement learning systems struggle with complex multi-image reasoning tasks. This paper seeks to overcome limitations in generalizing to real-world multi-image positional reasoning scenarios.

Method: The authors propose PeRL, a reinforcement learning approach tailored for interleaved multimodal reasoning tasks. PeRL uses permutation of image sequences to simulate diverse positional relationships and a rollout filtering mechanism to focus on informative learning trajectories.

Result: PeRL outperforms baseline VLMs and R1-inspired models on five multi-image benchmarks while maintaining comparable performance on single-image tasks.

Conclusion: The generalized PeRL approach successfully addresses multi-image reasoning challenges, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multi-image reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: Inspired by the impressive reasoning capabilities demonstrated by
reinforcement learning approaches like DeepSeek-R1, recent emerging research
has begun exploring the use of reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance
vision-language models (VLMs) for multimodal reasoning tasks. However, most
existing multimodal reinforcement learning approaches remain limited to spatial
reasoning within single-image contexts, yet still struggle to generalize to
more complex and real-world scenarios involving multi-image positional
reasoning, where understanding the relationships across images is crucial. To
address this challenge, we propose a general reinforcement learning approach
PeRL tailored for interleaved multimodal tasks, and a multi-stage strategy
designed to enhance the exploration-exploitation trade-off, thereby improving
learning efficiency and task performance. Specifically, we introduce
permutation of image sequences to simulate varied positional relationships to
explore more spatial and positional diversity. Furthermore, we design a rollout
filtering mechanism for resampling to focus on trajectories that contribute
most to learning optimal behaviors to exploit learned policies effectively. We
evaluate our model on 5 widely-used multi-image benchmarks and 3 single-image
benchmarks. Our experiments confirm that PeRL trained model consistently
surpasses R1-related and interleaved VLM baselines by a large margin, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on multi-image benchmarks, while preserving
comparable performance on single-image tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Frequency-Calibrated Reconstruction Error (FCRE), a method for Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) on diffusion models in medical imaging, addressing issues with prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle privacy concerns in medical image generation by improving Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) in diffusion models, which struggle with frequency-sensitive reconstruction errors.

Method: The proposed FCRE method analyzes mid-frequency reconstruction errors during the reverse diffusion process, calculating a structural similarity index score to determine membership in training data.

Result: Experiments on medical imaging datasets demonstrate that the FCRE method significantly outperforms existing methods for Membership Inference Attacks (MIA).

Conclusion: The FCRE method effectively improves privacy risk quantification on medical image diffusion models by addressing the limitations of inherent image difficulty and high-frequency reconstruction issues.

Abstract: The increasing use of diffusion models for image generation, especially in
sensitive areas like medical imaging, has raised significant privacy concerns.
Membership Inference Attack (MIA) has emerged as a potential approach to
determine if a specific image was used to train a diffusion model, thus
quantifying privacy risks. Existing MIA methods often rely on diffusion
reconstruction errors, where member images are expected to have lower
reconstruction errors than non-member images. However, applying these methods
directly to medical images faces challenges. Reconstruction error is influenced
by inherent image difficulty, and diffusion models struggle with high-frequency
detail reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose a
Frequency-Calibrated Reconstruction Error (FCRE) method for MIAs on medical
image diffusion models. By focusing on reconstruction errors within a specific
mid-frequency range and excluding both high-frequency (difficult to
reconstruct) and low-frequency (less informative) regions, our
frequency-selective approach mitigates the confounding factor of inherent image
difficulty. Specifically, we analyze the reverse diffusion process, obtain the
mid-frequency reconstruction error, and compute the structural similarity index
score between the reconstructed and original images. Membership is determined
by comparing this score to a threshold. Experiments on several medical image
datasets demonstrate that our FCRE method outperforms existing MIA methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve quark-gluon jet classification, an important problem in high-energy physics, by exploring the largely unexamined potential of Vision Transformers (ViTs) for calorimeter image analysis.

Method: The study uses multi-channel jet-view images constructed from detector-level energy deposits (ECAL, HCAL) and reconstructed tracks, applying ViT-based models to classify jets.

Result: ViT-based models, especially ViT+MaxViT and ViT+ConvNeXt hybrids, outperform CNNs in F1-score, ROC-AUC, and accuracy, showing an advantage in capturing long-range spatial correlations.

Conclusion: The paper provides a systematic framework demonstrating that ViTs are superior to CNNs for jet classification, encouraging further research using the established dataset and baselines.

Abstract: Distinguishing between quark- and gluon-initiated jets is a critical and
challenging task in high-energy physics, pivotal for improving new physics
searches and precision measurements at the Large Hadron Collider. While deep
learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), has advanced jet
tagging using image-based representations, the potential of Vision Transformer
(ViT) architectures, renowned for modeling global contextual information,
remains largely underexplored for direct calorimeter image analysis, especially
under realistic detector and pileup conditions. This paper presents a
systematic evaluation of ViTs and ViT-CNN hybrid models for quark-gluon jet
classification using simulated 2012 CMS Open Data. We construct multi-channel
jet-view images from detector-level energy deposits (ECAL, HCAL) and
reconstructed tracks, enabling an end-to-end learning approach. Our
comprehensive benchmarking demonstrates that ViT-based models, notably
ViT+MaxViT and ViT+ConvNeXt hybrids, consistently outperform established CNN
baselines in F1-score, ROC-AUC, and accuracy, highlighting the advantage of
capturing long-range spatial correlations within jet substructure. This work
establishes the first systematic framework and robust performance baselines for
applying ViT architectures to calorimeter image-based jet classification using
public collider data, alongside a structured dataset suitable for further deep
learning research in this domain.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces two new models using LRCNs and Transformers to improve compliance detection using RGB tactile images, outperforming traditional and baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of traditional compliance detection methods, which are non-portable, expensive, and unsuitable for robotics, and to improve upon existing vision-based neural network approaches with insufficient prediction accuracy.

Method: Two predictive models based on Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Networks (LRCNs) and Transformer architectures were developed. These models utilize RGB tactile images from GelSight sensors to estimate compliance metrics accurately.

Result: The proposed models outperformed baseline methods, demonstrated high prediction accuracy, and identified that harder-than-sensor objects are more difficult to estimate in terms of compliance.

Conclusion: The introduced models effectively improved the precision of compliance estimation, providing a significant advancement over traditional approaches and baseline models in tactile sensing and compliance prediction.

Abstract: Compliance is a critical parameter for describing objects in engineering,
agriculture, and biomedical applications. Traditional compliance detection
methods are limited by their lack of portability and scalability, rely on
specialized, often expensive equipment, and are unsuitable for robotic
applications. Moreover, existing neural network-based approaches using
vision-based tactile sensors still suffer from insufficient prediction
accuracy. In this paper, we propose two models based on Long-term Recurrent
Convolutional Networks (LRCNs) and Transformer architectures that leverage RGB
tactile images and other information captured by the vision-based sensor
GelSight to predict compliance metrics accurately. We validate the performance
of these models using multiple metrics and demonstrate their effectiveness in
accurately estimating compliance. The proposed models exhibit significant
performance improvement over the baseline. Additionally, we investigated the
correlation between sensor compliance and object compliance estimation, which
revealed that objects that are harder than the sensor are more challenging to
estimate.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces PALETTE, an end-to-end method for extracting text from historical maps using new sampling and embedding modules, along with a synthetic dataset SynthMap+, achieving superior performance and facilitating large-scale map text processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges in extracting text from historical maps, such as the lack of effective methods and training data, and the limitations of prior ad-hoc methods or general text spotters that struggle with features specific to map text.

Method: The proposed method introduces PALETTE with a hyper-local sampling module for learning localized image features and hyper-local positional embeddings to manage spatial interactions among boundary points and characters. It also leverages SynthMap+ to synthetically generate training data tailored to historical maps.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that PALETTE, combined with SynthMap+, outperforms state-of-the-art text spotters—especially for long and angled text—on two newly created historical map datasets.

Conclusion: PALETTE combined with SynthMap+ is an effective solution for processing text in historical maps, enabling large-scale applications such as extracting text from collections like the David Rumsey Historical Map collection and creating large datasets for enhanced usability.

Abstract: Text on historical maps contains valuable information providing georeferenced
historical, political, and cultural contexts. However, text extraction from
historical maps is challenging due to the lack of (1) effective methods and (2)
training data. Previous approaches use ad-hoc steps tailored to only specific
map styles. Recent machine learning-based text spotters (e.g., for scene
images) have the potential to solve these challenges because of their
flexibility in supporting various types of text instances. However, these
methods remain challenges in extracting precise image features for predicting
every sub-component (boundary points and characters) in a text instance. This
is critical because map text can be lengthy and highly rotated with complex
backgrounds, posing difficulties in detecting relevant image features from a
rough text region. This paper proposes PALETTE, an end-to-end text spotter for
scanned historical maps of a wide variety. PALETTE introduces a novel
hyper-local sampling module to explicitly learn localized image features around
the target boundary points and characters of a text instance for detection and
recognition. PALETTE also enables hyper-local positional embeddings to learn
spatial interactions between boundary points and characters within and across
text instances. In addition, this paper presents a novel approach to
automatically generate synthetic map images, SynthMap+, for training text
spotters for historical maps. The experiment shows that PALETTE with SynthMap+
outperforms SOTA text spotters on two new benchmark datasets of historical
maps, particularly for long and angled text. We have deployed PALETTE with
SynthMap+ to process over 60,000 maps in the David Rumsey Historical Map
collection and generated over 100 million text labels to support map searching.

Method: The framework utilizes a semantic-based style injection method with BLIP and CLIP to align text descriptions with the semantics of style images. A data augmentation strategy based on human feedback and a training-free triple diffusion process for refining self-attention features are also implemented.

Result: StyleWallfacer achieves high-quality image style transfer and text-driven stylization, enabling color editing during style transfer for the first time and maintaining the integrity of original image content.

Conclusion: StyleWallfacer significantly advances the field of style transfer by providing robust, efficient, and artist-level results, while enhancing the versatility and precision of stylization techniques.

Abstract: In this pioneering study, we introduce StyleWallfacer, a groundbreaking
unified training and inference framework, which not only addresses various
issues encountered in the style transfer process of traditional methods but
also unifies the framework for different tasks. This framework is designed to
revolutionize the field by enabling artist level style transfer and text driven
stylization. First, we propose a semantic-based style injection method that
uses BLIP to generate text descriptions strictly aligned with the semantics of
the style image in CLIP space. By leveraging a large language model to remove
style-related descriptions from these descriptions, we create a semantic gap.
This gap is then used to fine-tune the model, enabling efficient and drift-free
injection of style knowledge. Second, we propose a data augmentation strategy
based on human feedback, incorporating high-quality samples generated early in
the fine-tuning process into the training set to facilitate progressive
learning and significantly reduce its overfitting. Finally, we design a
training-free triple diffusion process using the fine-tuned model, which
manipulates the features of self-attention layers in a manner similar to the
cross-attention mechanism. Specifically, in the generation process, the key and
value of the content-related process are replaced with those of the
style-related process to inject style while maintaining text control over the
model. We also introduce query preservation to mitigate disruptions to the
original content. Under such a design, we have achieved high-quality
image-driven style transfer and text-driven stylization, delivering
artist-level style transfer results while preserving the original image
content. Moreover, we achieve image color editing during the style transfer
process for the first time.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses training instability and codebook collapse in vector quantization by aligning feature and code vector distributions using Wasserstein distance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve key issues of training instability and codebook collapse in vector quantization, which result in data loss and inefficient codebook usage.

Method: Utilizes the Wasserstein distance to align distributions of continuous features and code vectors, ensuring better codebook utilization and reduced quantization errors.

Result: Achieves near 100% codebook utilization, significantly lowers quantization error, and provides both empirical and theoretical validation.

Conclusion: The approach effectively solves major challenges in vector quantization, improving reliability and performance.

Abstract: The success of autoregressive models largely depends on the effectiveness of
vector quantization, a technique that discretizes continuous features by
mapping them to the nearest code vectors within a learnable codebook. Two
critical issues in existing vector quantization methods are training
instability and codebook collapse. Training instability arises from the
gradient discrepancy introduced by the straight-through estimator, especially
in the presence of significant quantization errors, while codebook collapse
occurs when only a small subset of code vectors are utilized during training. A
closer examination of these issues reveals that they are primarily driven by a
mismatch between the distributions of the features and code vectors, leading to
unrepresentative code vectors and significant data information loss during
compression. To address this, we employ the Wasserstein distance to align these
two distributions, achieving near 100\% codebook utilization and significantly
reducing the quantization error. Both empirical and theoretical analyses
validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

*Yufei Liu,Haoke Xiao,Jiaxing Chai,Yongcun Zhang,Rong Wang,Zijie Meng,Zhiming Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SynPo is a training-free method for few-shot medical image segmentation that improves the quality of negative prompts using a Confidence Map Synergy Module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current training-free LVM methods fail to make effective use of negative prompts, especially for low-contrast medical images.

Method: The method combines DINOv2 and SAM to create a high-quality confidence map, selects top-k positive points and negative Gaussian-distributed points, applies K-means clustering, and uses these as high-quality prompts for SAM.

Result: SynPo achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art training-based few-shot segmentation methods through enhanced prompt selection.

Conclusion: SynPo demonstrates that improving negative prompt quality through the innovative use of confidence maps can lead to effective and training-free medical image segmentation.

Abstract: The advent of Large Vision Models (LVMs) offers new opportunities for
few-shot medical image segmentation. However, existing training-free methods
based on LVMs fail to effectively utilize negative prompts, leading to poor
performance on low-contrast medical images. To address this issue, we propose
SynPo, a training-free few-shot method based on LVMs (e.g., SAM), with the core
insight: improving the quality of negative prompts. To select point prompts in
a more reliable confidence map, we design a novel Confidence Map Synergy Module
by combining the strengths of DINOv2 and SAM. Based on the confidence map, we
select the top-k pixels as the positive points set and choose the negative
points set using a Gaussian distribution, followed by independent K-means
clustering for both sets. Then, these selected points are leveraged as
high-quality prompts for SAM to get the segmentation results. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SynPo achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art training-based few-shot methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Point Distribution Set Abstraction (PDSA) module to improve point cloud analysis by utilizing high-dimensional correlation for efficient and robust feature aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations in point cloud analysis such as irrelevant point interference, feature hierarchy gaps, high computational overhead, and noise sensitivity in traditional geometric structure encoding.

Method: The method involves developing the PDSA module that uses high-dimensional correlations for feature distribution correction, reduces neighbor feature matrix variance, and enhances class separability. It also includes a key point mechanism for computational efficiency.

Result: Experimental results show that PDSA improves performance in semantic segmentation and classification tasks across different baselines while reducing parameter costs.

Conclusion: PDSA is an effective and efficient approach to improve point cloud analysis, demonstrating robustness, generalization, and rationality in experiments and visualizations.

Abstract: Point cloud analysis is the cornerstone of many downstream tasks, among which
aggregating local structures is the basis for understanding point cloud data.
While numerous works aggregate neighbor using three-dimensional relative
coordinates, there are irrelevant point interference and feature hierarchy gap
problems due to the limitation of local coordinates. Although some works
address this limitation by refining spatial description though explicit
modeling of cross-stage structure, these enhancement methods based on direct
geometric structure encoding have problems of high computational overhead and
noise sensitivity. To overcome these problems, we propose the Point
Distribution Set Abstraction module (PDSA) that utilizes the correlation in the
high-dimensional space to correct the feature distribution during aggregation,
which improves the computational efficiency and robustness. PDSA distinguishes
the point correlation based on a lightweight cross-stage structural descriptor,
and enhances structural homogeneity by reducing the variance of the neighbor
feature matrix and increasing classes separability though long-distance
modeling. Additionally, we introducing a key point mechanism to optimize the
computational overhead. The experimental result on semantic segmentation and
classification tasks based on different baselines verify the generalization of
the method we proposed, and achieve significant performance improvement with
less parameter cost. The corresponding ablation and visualization results
demonstrate the effectiveness and rationality of our method. The code and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate segmentation of the left ventricle in echocardiograms is critical for diagnostics but challenging due to noisy and ambiguous ultrasound images.

Method: Echo-DND combines Gaussian and Bernoulli noises, a multi-scale fusion conditioning module, and spatial coherence calibration to improve segmentation accuracy.

Result: The model achieves Dice scores of 0.962 and 0.939 on the CAMUS and EchoNet-Dynamic datasets, outperforming existing state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: Echo-DND advances echocardiogram segmentation and shows promise for wider use in medical imaging, potentially enhancing diagnostic accuracy in various domains.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have
revolutionized image processing, demonstrating significant potential in medical
applications. Accurate segmentation of the left ventricle (LV) in
echocardiograms is crucial for diagnostic procedures and necessary treatments.
However, ultrasound images are notoriously noisy with low contrast and
ambiguous LV boundaries, thereby complicating the segmentation process. To
address these challenges, this paper introduces Echo-DND, a novel dual-noise
diffusion model specifically designed for this task. Echo-DND leverages a
unique combination of Gaussian and Bernoulli noises. It also incorporates a
multi-scale fusion conditioning module to improve segmentation precision.
Furthermore, it utilizes spatial coherence calibration to maintain spatial
integrity in segmentation masks. The model's performance was rigorously
validated on the CAMUS and EchoNet-Dynamic datasets. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing SOTA models. It
achieves high Dice scores of 0.962 and 0.939 on these datasets, respectively.
The proposed Echo-DND model establishes a new standard in echocardiogram
segmentation, and its architecture holds promise for broader applicability in
other medical imaging tasks, potentially improving diagnostic accuracy across
various medical domains. Project page: https://abdur75648.github.io/Echo-DND

*Ziling Huang,Yidan Zhang,Shin'ichi Satoh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReSeDis combines corpus-level retrieval with pixel-level grounding to find and localize objects based on free-form descriptions in large image collections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for locating objects based on free-form descriptions fail to unify retrieval with precise object localization, leaving gaps in performance for large datasets.

Method: ReSeDis introduces a unified task that combines object retrieval with bounding box or mask localization, supported by a curated benchmark and a novel metric to evaluate combined efficiency.

Result: A zero-shot baseline using frozen vision-language models demonstrated potential but also revealed significant room for improvement in performance.

Conclusion: ReSeDis sets a realistic benchmark for advancing multimodal search systems, bridging retrieval and localization tasks in large-scale visual search engines.

Abstract: Large-scale visual search engines are expected to solve a dual problem at
once: (i) locate every image that truly contains the object described by a
sentence and (ii) identify the object's bounding box or exact pixels within
each hit. Existing techniques address only one side of this challenge. Visual
grounding yields tight boxes and masks but rests on the unrealistic assumption
that the object is present in every test image, producing a flood of false
alarms when applied to web-scale collections. Text-to-image retrieval excels at
sifting through massive databases to rank relevant images, yet it stops at
whole-image matches and offers no fine-grained localization. We introduce
Referring Search and Discovery (ReSeDis), the first task that unifies
corpus-level retrieval with pixel-level grounding. Given a free-form
description, a ReSeDis model must decide whether the queried object appears in
each image and, if so, where it is, returning bounding boxes or segmentation
masks. To enable rigorous study, we curate a benchmark in which every
description maps uniquely to object instances scattered across a large, diverse
corpus, eliminating unintended matches. We further design a task-specific
metric that jointly scores retrieval recall and localization precision.
Finally, we provide a straightforward zero-shot baseline using a frozen
vision-language model, revealing significant headroom for future study. ReSeDis
offers a realistic, end-to-end testbed for building the next generation of
robust and scalable multimodal search systems.

Motivation: Specialized models in medical image analysis excel at predefined tasks but are resource-intensive for adaptation. Generalist models can fulfill tasks dynamically, addressing this limitation.

Method: The authors train generalist models for retinal OCT using visual in-context learning, enabling generalization across tasks through a few examples given during inference.

Result: Extensive evaluation of the proposed VICL approach on multiple retinal OCT datasets highlights its potential and limitations. They establish a baseline for this method.

Conclusion: The study showcases the utility of VICL for retinal OCT tasks and offers a baseline. Additionally, their code release facilitates further research and adoption.

Abstract: Recent advancements in medical image analysis have led to the development of
highly specialized models tailored to specific clinical tasks. These models
have demonstrated exceptional performance and remain a crucial research
direction. Yet, their applicability is limited to predefined tasks, requiring
expertise and extensive resources for development and adaptation. In contrast,
generalist models offer a different form of utility: allowing medical
practitioners to define tasks on the fly without the need for task-specific
model development. In this work, we explore how to train generalist models for
the domain of retinal optical coherence tomography using visual in-context
learning (VICL), i.e., training models to generalize across tasks based on a
few examples provided at inference time. To facilitate rigorous assessment, we
propose a broad evaluation protocol tailored to VICL in OCT. We extensively
evaluate a state-of-the-art medical VICL approach on multiple retinal OCT
datasets, establishing a first baseline to highlight the potential and current
limitations of in-context learning for OCT. To foster further research and
practical adoption, we openly release our code.

Conclusion: The research highlights the limitations of current MLLMs in handling complex visual and causal reasoning tasks, emphasizing the need for future advancements and refinements.

Abstract: As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) continue to evolve, their
cognitive and reasoning capabilities have seen remarkable progress. However,
challenges in visual fine-grained perception and commonsense causal inference
persist. This paper introduces Argus Inspection, a multimodal benchmark with
two levels of difficulty, emphasizing detailed visual recognition while
incorporating real-world commonsense understanding to evaluate causal reasoning
abilities. Expanding on it, we present the Eye of Panoptes framework, which
integrates a binary parametric Sigmoid metric with an indicator function,
enabling a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs' responses in opinion-based
reasoning tasks. Experiments conducted on 26 mainstream MLLMs reveal that the
highest performance in visual fine-grained reasoning reaches only 0.46,
highlighting considerable potential for enhancement. Our research offers

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method called Privacy-Shielded Image Compression (PSIC) to protect privacy by embedding defenses in the image compression process to prevent VLP models from exploiting the images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing difficulty in protecting publicly posted images from being exploited by vision-language pretrained (VLP) models and other tools, and to enhance user privacy during the image compression process.

Method: The authors propose PSIC, a method producing bitstreams with multiple decoding options, including a default option that reduces interpretation by VLP models while maintaining perceptual quality. It uses a Conditional Latent Trigger Generation (CLTG) module for customizable input conditions, an Uncertainty-Aware Encryption-Oriented (UAEO) optimization function to guide the process, and an adaptive multi-objective optimization strategy.

Result: The method demonstrates effectiveness in achieving improved encryption performance and perceptual quality through extensive experiments across various downstream tasks, and it can be integrated into most learned image compression models.

Conclusion: PSIC offers a practical, flexible, and effective solution for privacy protection during image compression, balancing perceptual quality and resistance to VLP model exploitation.

Abstract: The improved semantic understanding of vision-language pretrained (VLP)
models has made it increasingly difficult to protect publicly posted images
from being exploited by search engines and other similar tools. In this
context, this paper seeks to protect users' privacy by implementing defenses at
the image compression stage to prevent exploitation. Specifically, we propose a
flexible coding method, termed Privacy-Shielded Image Compression (PSIC), that
can produce bitstreams with multiple decoding options. By default, the
bitstream is decoded to preserve satisfactory perceptual quality while
preventing interpretation by VLP models. Our method also retains the original
image compression functionality. With a customizable input condition, the
proposed scheme can reconstruct the image that preserves its full semantic
information. A Conditional Latent Trigger Generation (CLTG) module is proposed
to produce bias information based on customizable conditions to guide the
decoding process into different reconstructed versions, and an
Uncertainty-Aware Encryption-Oriented (UAEO) optimization function is designed
to leverage the soft labels inferred from the target VLP model's uncertainty on
the training data. This paper further incorporates an adaptive multi-objective
optimization strategy to obtain improved encrypting performance and perceptual
quality simultaneously within a unified training process. The proposed scheme
is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly integrated into most existing Learned
Image Compression (LIC) models. Extensive experiments across multiple
downstream tasks have demonstrated the effectiveness of our design.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes DM-FNet, a two-stage diffusion model-based fusion network for improving multimodal medical image fusion quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MMIF methods lack the ability to effectively capture detailed features and cross-modal interactions, leading to subpar image fusion quality.

Method: The study introduces a two-stage fusion network. Stage I uses a diffusion-based UNet for progressive denoising and feature extraction, while Stage II incorporates a fusion network with three custom fusion modules to analyze noisy images. A hybrid loss function optimizes image brightness, color, contrast, and detail.

Result: Experimental results show that DM-FNet outperforms prior methods, yielding fused images with enhanced diagnostic details including brightness, textures, and clear edges.

Conclusion: DM-FNet improves cross-modal feature interaction and detail preservation in medical image fusion, demonstrating superiority in objective evaluation metrics. The code is publicly available for reproducibility.

Abstract: Multimodal medical image fusion (MMIF) extracts the most meaningful
information from multiple source images, enabling a more comprehensive and
accurate diagnosis. Achieving high-quality fusion results requires a careful
balance of brightness, color, contrast, and detail; this ensures that the fused
images effectively display relevant anatomical structures and reflect the
functional status of the tissues. However, existing MMIF methods have limited
capacity to capture detailed features during conventional training and suffer
from insufficient cross-modal feature interaction, leading to suboptimal fused
image quality. To address these issues, this study proposes a two-stage
diffusion model-based fusion network (DM-FNet) to achieve unified MMIF. In
Stage I, a diffusion process trains UNet for image reconstruction. UNet
captures detailed information through progressive denoising and represents
multilevel data, providing a rich set of feature representations for the
subsequent fusion network. In Stage II, noisy images at various steps are input
into the fusion network to enhance the model's feature recognition capability.
Three key fusion modules are also integrated to process medical images from
different modalities adaptively. Ultimately, the robust network structure and a
hybrid loss function are integrated to harmonize the fused image's brightness,
color, contrast, and detail, enhancing its quality and information density. The
experimental results across various medical image types demonstrate that the
proposed method performs exceptionally well regarding objective evaluation
metrics. The fused image preserves appropriate brightness, a comprehensive
distribution of radioactive tracers, rich textures, and clear edges. The code

Conclusion: Video-SALMONN 2 represents a significant advancement in video captioning accuracy, setting a new standard with efficient parameter usage and innovative optimization techniques.

Abstract: Videos contain a wealth of information, and generating detailed and accurate

this paper, we present video-SALMONN 2, an advanced audio-visual large language

paired audio) captioning through directed preference optimisation (DPO). We
propose new metrics to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of video
descriptions, which are optimised using DPO. To further improve training, we
propose a novel multi-round DPO (MrDPO) approach, which involves periodically
updating the DPO reference model, merging and re-initialising the LoRA module
as a proxy for parameter updates after each training round (1,000 steps), and
incorporating guidance from ground-truth video captions to stabilise the
process. Experimental results show that MrDPO significantly enhances
video-SALMONN 2's captioning accuracy, reducing the captioning error rates by

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) enables submeter-resolution imaging and
all-weather monitoring via active microwave and advanced signal processing.
Currently, SAR has found extensive applications in critical maritime domains
such as ship detection. However, SAR ship detection faces several challenges,
including significant scale variations among ships, the presence of small

enrich feature representation and enhance the ability to capture and represent
local details and contextual information. Furthermore, C-AFBiFPN innovatively
integrates BiFormer attention within the fusion strategy of BiFPN, creating the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of accurate camera pose estimation in complex scenarios where traditional methods fall short.

Method: RA-NeRF combines NeRF-based photometric consistency, flow-driven pose regulation, and an implicit pose filter to refine camera pose estimation.

Result: RA-NeRF achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in pose estimation and visual quality on Tanks&Temple and NeRFBuster datasets.

Conclusion: RA-NeRF is effective and robust for complex camera trajectories, advancing 3D reconstruction and SLAM tasks.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have emerged
as powerful tools for 3D reconstruction and SLAM tasks. However, their
performance depends heavily on accurate camera pose priors. Existing approaches
attempt to address this issue by introducing external constraints but fall
short of achieving satisfactory accuracy, particularly when camera trajectories
are complex. In this paper, we propose a novel method, RA-NeRF, capable of
predicting highly accurate camera poses even with complex camera trajectories.
Following the incremental pipeline, RA-NeRF reconstructs the scene using NeRF
with photometric consistency and incorporates flow-driven pose regulation to
enhance robustness during initialization and localization. Additionally,
RA-NeRF employs an implicit pose filter to capture the camera movement pattern
and eliminate the noise for pose estimation. To validate our method, we conduct
extensive experiments on the Tanks\&Temple dataset for standard evaluation, as
well as the NeRFBuster dataset, which presents challenging camera pose
trajectories. On both datasets, RA-NeRF achieves state-of-the-art results in
both camera pose estimation and visual quality, demonstrating its effectiveness
and robustness in scene reconstruction under complex pose trajectories.

TL;DR: The paper proposes RetroMem, a recall-augmented architecture for camouflaged object detection, effectively utilizing historical knowledge to enhance inference of camouflage patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for COD lack mechanisms to utilize historical context, limiting adaptation in handling challenging camouflage scenes.

Method: RetroMem employs a two-stage training paradigm: learning stage with a dense multi-scale adapter (DMA) for foundational inferences, and recall stage with dynamic memory mechanism (DMM) and inference pattern reconstruction (IPR) for improved camouflage understanding.

Result: RetroMem demonstrates significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art COD methods on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: Integrating historical knowledge dynamically boosts camouflage pattern perception, offering a new paradigm for COD tasks.

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection (COD) primarily focuses on learning subtle yet
discriminative representations from complex scenes. Existing methods
predominantly follow the parametric feedforward architecture based on static
visual representation modeling. However, they lack explicit mechanisms for
acquiring historical context, limiting their adaptation and effectiveness in
handling challenging camouflage scenes. In this paper, we propose a
recall-augmented COD architecture, namely RetroMem, which dynamically modulates
camouflage pattern perception and inference by integrating relevant historical
knowledge into the process. Specifically, RetroMem employs a two-stage training
paradigm consisting of a learning stage and a recall stage to construct,
update, and utilize memory representations effectively. During the learning
stage, we design a dense multi-scale adapter (DMA) to improve the pretrained
encoder's capability to capture rich multi-scale visual information with very
few trainable parameters, thereby providing foundational inferences. In the
recall stage, we propose a dynamic memory mechanism (DMM) and an inference
pattern reconstruction (IPR). These components fully leverage the latent
relationships between learned knowledge and current sample context to
reconstruct the inference of camouflage patterns, thereby significantly
improving the model's understanding of camouflage scenes. Extensive experiments
on several widely used datasets demonstrate that our RetroMem significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Result: Experimental validation on real-world Electron Microscope images shows that DA techniques, including DBACS, are effective in improving performance in the semiconductor domain.

Conclusion: DA techniques, especially the proposed DBACS model, advance defect detection in the semiconductor sector, reducing resource costs and minimizing manual effort while improving robustness and scalability.

Abstract: In the semiconductor sector, due to high demand but also strong and
increasing competition, time to market and quality are key factors in securing
significant market share in various application areas. Thanks to the success of
deep learning methods in recent years in the computer vision domain, Industry
4.0 and 5.0 applications, such as defect classification, have achieved
remarkable success. In particular, Domain Adaptation (DA) has proven highly
effective since it focuses on using the knowledge learned on a (source) domain
to adapt and perform effectively on a different but related (target) domain. By
improving robustness and scalability, DA minimizes the need for extensive
manual re-labeling or re-training of models. This not only reduces
computational and resource costs but also allows human experts to focus on
high-value tasks. Therefore, we tested the efficacy of DA techniques in
semi-supervised and unsupervised settings within the context of the
semiconductor field. Moreover, we propose the DBACS approach, a
CycleGAN-inspired model enhanced with additional loss terms to improve
performance. All the approaches are studied and validated on real-world
Electron Microscope images considering the unsupervised and semi-supervised
settings, proving the usefulness of our method in advancing DA techniques for
the semiconductor field.

*Jun Zhu,Xinfeng Zhang,Lv Tang,JunHao Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes MSNeRV, a novel framework for neural video representation and compression, which surpasses existing INR-based methods and top-tier codecs like VTM-23.7 in dynamic scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing INR-based methods face challenges in representing detail-intensive and fast-changing video content due to underutilization of internal network features and lack of video-specific considerations.

Method: The MSNeRV framework incorporates a multi-scale feature fusion approach by enhancing temporal consistency with temporal windows, dividing videos into Groups of Pictures (GoPs), using GoP-level grids for background representation, and integrating a multi-scale spatial decoder with an adaptive loss function. Multi-scale feature blocks improve feature extraction.

Result: Experimental evaluation on HEVC ClassB and UVG datasets shows MSNeRV surpasses other INR-based methods and VTM-23.7 (Random Access) in dynamic scenarios in terms of compression efficiency.

Conclusion: MSNeRV addresses the limitations of INR-based methods, providing an efficient and superior method for dynamic video representation and compression by leveraging multi-scale features and video-specific design considerations.

Abstract: Implicit Neural representations (INRs) have emerged as a promising approach
for video compression, and have achieved comparable performance to the
state-of-the-art codecs such as H.266/VVC. However, existing INR-based methods
struggle to effectively represent detail-intensive and fast-changing video
content. This limitation mainly stems from the underutilization of internal
network features and the absence of video-specific considerations in network
design. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-scale feature fusion
framework, MSNeRV, for neural video representation. In the encoding stage, we
enhance temporal consistency by employing temporal windows, and divide the
video into multiple Groups of Pictures (GoPs), where a GoP-level grid is used
for background representation. Additionally, we design a multi-scale spatial
decoder with a scale-adaptive loss function to integrate multi-resolution and
multi-frequency information. To further improve feature extraction, we
introduce a multi-scale feature block that fully leverages hidden features. We
evaluate MSNeRV on HEVC ClassB and UVG datasets for video representation and
compression. Experimental results demonstrate that our model exhibits superior
representation capability among INR-based approaches and surpasses VTM-23.7
(Random Access) in dynamic scenarios in terms of compression efficiency.

TL;DR: This paper introduces BCRNet, an advanced framework for detecting anatomical landmarks in laparoscopic liver surgery using Bezier curve refinement strategies, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the accuracy of anatomical landmark detection in laparoscopic liver surgery to enhance the effectiveness of augmented reality-based surgical navigation systems.

Method: The authors propose a three-step framework: Multi-modal Feature Extraction (MFE) for robust semantic feature capture, Adaptive Curve Proposal Initialization (ACPI) for generating accurate initial Bezier curve proposals, and Hierarchical Curve Refinement (HCR) for iterative, multi-stage adjustment of those proposals.

Result: BCRNet achieves substantial performance improvements over existing methods, as demonstrated in evaluations with L3D and P2ILF datasets.

Conclusion: The framework establishes a new benchmark in landmark detection, offering notable advancements for augmented reality applications in minimally invasive liver surgeries. Code will be released for further research and application.

Abstract: Laparoscopic liver surgery, while minimally invasive, poses significant
challenges in accurately identifying critical anatomical structures. Augmented
reality (AR) systems, integrating MRI/CT with laparoscopic images based on
2D-3D registration, offer a promising solution for enhancing surgical
navigation. A vital aspect of the registration progress is the precise
detection of curvilinear anatomical landmarks in laparoscopic images. In this
paper, we propose BCRNet (Bezier Curve Refinement Net), a novel framework that
significantly enhances landmark detection in laparoscopic liver surgery
primarily via the Bezier curve refinement strategy. The framework starts with a
Multi-modal Feature Extraction (MFE) module designed to robustly capture
semantic features. Then we propose Adaptive Curve Proposal Initialization
(ACPI) to generate pixel-aligned Bezier curves and confidence scores for
reliable initial proposals. Additionally, we design the Hierarchical Curve
Refinement (HCR) mechanism to enhance these proposals iteratively through a
multi-stage process, capturing fine-grained contextual details from multi-scale
pixel-level features for precise Bezier curve adjustment. Extensive evaluations
on the L3D and P2ILF datasets demonstrate that BCRNet outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant performance improvements. Code
will be available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViMAT is an AI-powered system for real-time visual monitoring of assembly tasks, eliminating the need for rigid setups or visual markers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial assembly tasks need accurate monitoring to prevent damage and ensure safety, but existing solutions are restrictive.

Method: ViMAT combines multi-view perception for visual data and reasoning for task inference using prior knowledge.

Result: The system was validated on two real-world assembly tasks, proving its effectiveness even under challenging visual conditions.

Conclusion: ViMAT provides robust monitoring capabilities for industrial assembly tasks without rigid setup requirements, addressing prevalent challenges.

Abstract: Visual monitoring of industrial assembly tasks is critical for preventing
equipment damage due to procedural errors and ensuring worker safety. Although
commercial solutions exist, they typically require rigid workspace setups or
the application of visual markers to simplify the problem. We introduce ViMAT,
a novel AI-driven system for real-time visual monitoring of assembly tasks that
operates without these constraints. ViMAT combines a perception module that
extracts visual observations from multi-view video streams with a reasoning
module that infers the most likely action being performed based on the observed
assembly state and prior task knowledge. We validate ViMAT on two assembly
tasks, involving the replacement of LEGO components and the reconfiguration of
hydraulic press molds, demonstrating its effectiveness through quantitative and
qualitative analysis in challenging real-world scenarios characterized by
partial and uncertain visual observations. Project page:

*Xingrui Qin,Wentao Zhao,Chuan Cao,Yihe Niu,Houcheng Jiang,Jingchuan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RaCalNet presents a new approach to metric depth estimation using sparse LiDAR instead of dense supervision, achieving superior results in terms of accuracy and detail preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense depth estimation methods require costly dense supervision using LiDAR, which is data-intensive and inefficient.

Method: RaCalNet recalibrates sparse radar points to generate depth priors, which guide monocular depth prediction, eliminating reliance on dense LiDAR labels.

Result: RaCalNet improves depth estimation accuracy, reducing RMSE by 35.30% on the ZJU-4DRadarCam dataset and by 34.89% in real-world tests.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates that sparse supervision can be effective and even surpass dense-supervised methodologies, offering a more efficient solution.

Abstract: Dense metric depth estimation using millimeter-wave radar typically requires
dense LiDAR supervision, generated via multi-frame projection and
interpolation, to guide the learning of accurate depth from sparse radar
measurements and RGB images. However, this paradigm is both costly and
data-intensive. To address this, we propose RaCalNet, a novel framework that
eliminates the need for dense supervision by using sparse LiDAR to supervise
the learning of refined radar measurements, resulting in a supervision density
of merely around 1% compared to dense-supervised methods. Unlike previous
approaches that associate radar points with broad image regions and rely
heavily on dense labels, RaCalNet first recalibrates and refines sparse radar
points to construct accurate depth priors. These priors then serve as reliable
anchors to guide monocular depth prediction, enabling metric-scale estimation
without resorting to dense supervision. This design improves structural
consistency and preserves fine details. Despite relying solely on sparse
supervision, RaCalNet surpasses state-of-the-art dense-supervised methods,
producing depth maps with clear object contours and fine-grained textures.
Extensive experiments on the ZJU-4DRadarCam dataset and real-world deployment
scenarios demonstrate its effectiveness, reducing RMSE by 35.30% and 34.89%,
respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the ME Grand Challenge (MEGC) 2025, emphasizing unified facial micro-expression spotting and recognition tasks, as well as exploring micro-expression understanding through visual question answering using large multimodal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Micro-expressions are critical for understanding suppressed emotions in high-stakes situations, but analyzing them in realistic, long-duration video settings remains challenging.

Method: Two tasks are introduced: ME spot-then-recognize (ME-STR) pipeline for spotting and recognition and ME visual question answering (ME-VQA), leveraging multimodal large models to answer diverse questions about micro-expressions.

Result: Participants are expected to test their algorithms on MEGC 2025's datasets and submit results to a leaderboard, driving advancements in micro-expression analysis.

Conclusion: The challenge encourages advancements in integrated micro-expression analysis workflows and innovative applications of multimodal models for deeper understanding of subtle facial expressions.

Abstract: Facial micro-expressions (MEs) are involuntary movements of the face that
occur spontaneously when a person experiences an emotion but attempts to
suppress or repress the facial expression, typically found in a high-stakes
environment. In recent years, substantial advancements have been made in the
areas of ME recognition, spotting, and generation. However, conventional
approaches that treat spotting and recognition as separate tasks are
suboptimal, particularly for analyzing long-duration videos in realistic
settings. Concurrently, the emergence of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs) offers promising new avenues
for enhancing ME analysis through their powerful multimodal reasoning
capabilities. The ME grand challenge (MEGC) 2025 introduces two tasks that
reflect these evolving research directions: (1) ME spot-then-recognize
(ME-STR), which integrates ME spotting and subsequent recognition in a unified
sequential pipeline; and (2) ME visual question answering (ME-VQA), which
explores ME understanding through visual question answering, leveraging MLLMs
or LVLMs to address diverse question types related to MEs. All participating
algorithms are required to run on this test set and submit their results on a
leaderboard. More details are available at https://megc2025.github.io.

### [106] [FindingDory: A Benchmark to Evaluate Memory in Embodied Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15635)
*Karmesh Yadav,Yusuf Ali,Gunshi Gupta,Yarin Gal,Zsolt Kira*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmark to evaluate large vision-language models' ability to handle long-term memory in embodied robotics tasks, addressing past limitations in processing vast amounts of visual data effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the application of vision-language models in robotics by addressing their current limitations in reasoning over long-term memory in embodied tasks.

Method: The researchers created a benchmark within the Habitat simulator featuring 60 memory-intensive tasks and integrated vision-language models with navigation policies to evaluate their capabilities.

Result: Baseline experiments demonstrated areas where current models struggle with memory and reasoning in robotics tasks, highlighting the need for improved techniques.

Conclusion: The benchmark is valuable for studying memory integration and reasoning in embodied contexts, providing a scalable framework for advancing robotics systems that depend on long-term memory.

Abstract: Large vision-language models have recently demonstrated impressive
performance in planning and control tasks, driving interest in their
application to real-world robotics. However, deploying these models for
reasoning in embodied contexts is limited by their ability to incorporate
long-term experience collected across multiple days and represented by vast
collections of images. Current VLMs typically struggle to process more than a
few hundred images concurrently, highlighting the need for more efficient
mechanisms to handle long-term memory in embodied settings. To effectively
evaluate these models for long-horizon control, a benchmark must specifically
target scenarios where memory is crucial for success. Existing long-video QA
benchmarks overlook embodied challenges like object manipulation and
navigation, which demand low-level skills and fine-grained reasoning over past
interactions. Moreover, effective memory integration in embodied agents
involves both recalling relevant historical information and executing actions
based on that information, making it essential to study these aspects together
rather than in isolation. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark for
long-range embodied tasks in the Habitat simulator. This benchmark evaluates
memory-based capabilities across 60 tasks requiring sustained engagement and
contextual awareness in an environment. The tasks can also be procedurally
extended to longer and more challenging versions, enabling scalable evaluation
of memory and reasoning. We also present baselines that integrate
state-of-the-art VLMs with low level navigation policies, assessing their
performance on these memory-intensive tasks and highlight areas for
improvement.

### [108] [OpenPath: Open-Set Active Learning for Pathology Image Classification via Pre-trained Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15318)
*Lanfeng Zhong,Xin Liao,Shichuan Zhang,Shaoting Zhang,Guotai Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes OpenPath, an active learning framework utilizing a Vision-Language Model to improve pathological image classification by handling Out-Of-Distribution data and optimizing initial and subsequent query rounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to tackle challenges in pathological image classification, specifically the inefficiency in handling Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data and the wasteful initial random selection in open-set active learning approaches.

Method: OpenPath employs a pre-trained Vision-Language Model using task-specific prompts for initial queries to select In-Distribution and informative samples. For subsequent queries, it uses Diverse Informative ID Sampling, comprising Prototype-based ID candidate Selection and Entropy-Guided Stochastic Sampling, to ensure a pure and informative sample selection process.

Result: The experimental results on two public pathology image datasets demonstrate that OpenPath significantly boosts model performance by enhancing the purity of selected samples, outperforming several state-of-the-art open-set active learning methods.

Conclusion: OpenPath addresses inefficiencies in open-set active learning for pathology image classification by leveraging task-specific prompts and an innovative diverse sampling framework, making it effective and annotation-efficient. The proposed method shows superior performance and practical applicability in medical settings.

Abstract: Pathology image classification plays a crucial role in accurate medical
diagnosis and treatment planning. Training high-performance models for this
task typically requires large-scale annotated datasets, which are both
expensive and time-consuming to acquire. Active Learning (AL) offers a solution
by iteratively selecting the most informative samples for annotation, thereby
reducing the labeling effort. However, most AL methods are designed under the
assumption of a closed-set scenario, where all the unannotated images belong to
target classes. In real-world clinical environments, the unlabeled pool often
contains a substantial amount of Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data, leading to low
efficiency of annotation in traditional AL methods. Furthermore, most existing
AL methods start with random selection in the first query round, leading to a
significant waste of labeling costs in open-set scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose OpenPath, a novel open-set active learning approach for
pathological image classification leveraging a pre-trained Vision-Language
Model (VLM). In the first query, we propose task-specific prompts that combine
target and relevant non-target class prompts to effectively select
In-Distribution (ID) and informative samples from the unlabeled pool. In
subsequent queries, Diverse Informative ID Sampling (DIS) that includes
Prototype-based ID candidate Selection (PIS) and Entropy-Guided Stochastic
Sampling (EGSS) is proposed to ensure both purity and informativeness in a
query, avoiding the selection of OOD samples. Experiments on two public
pathology image datasets show that OpenPath significantly enhances the model's
performance due to its high purity of selected samples, and outperforms several
state-of-the-art open-set AL methods. The code is available at

TL;DR: Introducing task of open-world object counting in videos using CountVid model and VideoCount dataset with strong performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing object counting methods struggle in dynamic, crowded, and occluded video settings. A new task and method are needed for accurate enumeration.

Method: Introduced a model (CountVid) integrating image-based counting and video segmentation/tracking. Created and used a novel VideoCount dataset for validation.

Result: CountVid demonstrates high accuracy in object counting and surpasses baseline approaches in the new dataset.

Conclusion: CountVid and VideoCount contribute significantly to automated, open-world object counting in videos, addressing occlusion and re-identification.

Abstract: We introduce a new task of open-world object counting in videos: given a text
description, or an image example, that specifies the target object, the
objective is to enumerate all the unique instances of the target objects in the
video. This task is especially challenging in crowded scenes with occlusions
and similar objects, where avoiding double counting and identifying
reappearances is crucial. To this end, we make the following contributions: we
introduce a model, CountVid, for this task. It leverages an image-based
counting model, and a promptable video segmentation and tracking model to
enable automated, open-world object counting across video frames. To evaluate
its performance, we introduce VideoCount, a new dataset for our novel task
built from the TAO and MOT20 tracking datasets, as well as from videos of
penguins and metal alloy crystallization captured by x-rays. Using this
dataset, we demonstrate that CountVid provides accurate object counts, and
significantly outperforms strong baselines. The VideoCount dataset, the
CountVid model, and all the code are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing animal re-identification methods struggle with geometric distortions in fur or skin patterns due to movement and posture changes.

Method: The authors propose a geometry-aware texture mapping approach that uses surface normal estimation to unwarp animal pelage patterns into a canonical 2D UV space.

Result: Their approach demonstrates up to a 5.4% improvement in re-identification accuracy across pose and viewing angle variations for seals and leopards.

Conclusion: The novel UV mapping framework enhances re-identification, works in a self-supervised manner, and does not require ground truth UV annotations.

Abstract: Existing individual re-identification methods often struggle with the
deformable nature of animal fur or skin patterns which undergo geometric
distortions due to body movement and posture changes. In this paper, we propose
a geometry-aware texture mapping approach that unwarps pelage patterns, the
unique markings found on an animal's skin or fur, into a canonical UV space,
enabling more robust feature matching. Our method uses surface normal
estimation to guide the unwrapping process while preserving the geometric
consistency between the 3D surface and the 2D texture space. We focus on two
challenging species: Saimaa ringed seals (Pusa hispida saimensis) and leopards
(Panthera pardus). Both species have distinctive yet highly deformable fur
patterns. By integrating our pattern-preserving UV mapping with existing
re-identification techniques, we demonstrate improved accuracy across diverse
poses and viewing angles. Our framework does not require ground truth UV
annotations and can be trained in a self-supervised manner. Experiments on seal
and leopard datasets show up to a 5.4% improvement in re-identification
accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes DDIS, a new method utilizing diffusion models to improve Data-Free Image Synthesis (DFIS) quality and better match original training data distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Data-Free Image Synthesis methods struggle to accurately replicate the training data distribution due to a lack of prior knowledge about natural images.

Method: The authors propose DDIS, a method leveraging a text-to-image diffusion model as an image prior, combined with Domain Alignment Guidance (DAG) and a Class Alignment Token (CAT) to align synthetic data to the original training data distribution.

Result: The experiments on PACS and ImageNet datasets show that DDIS generates synthetic images that align more closely with the training data distribution, outperforming previous DFIS methods and achieving state-of-the-art results in data-free applications.

Conclusion: DDIS effectively addresses the limitations of existing DFIS methods by incorporating diffusion models and novel guidance strategies, setting a new standard for synthetic data quality in data-free scenarios.

Abstract: Open-source pre-trained models hold great potential for diverse applications,
but their utility declines when their training data is unavailable. Data-Free
Image Synthesis (DFIS) aims to generate images that approximate the learned
data distribution of a pre-trained model without accessing the original data.
However, existing DFIS meth ods produce samples that deviate from the training
data distribution due to the lack of prior knowl edge about natural images. To
overcome this limitation, we propose DDIS, the first Diffusion-assisted
Data-free Image Synthesis method that leverages a text-to-image diffusion model
as a powerful image prior, improving synthetic image quality. DDIS extracts
knowledge about the learned distribution from the given model and uses it to
guide the diffusion model, enabling the generation of images that accurately
align with the training data distribution. To achieve this, we introduce Domain
Alignment Guidance (DAG) that aligns the synthetic data domain with the
training data domain during the diffusion sampling process. Furthermore, we
optimize a single Class Alignment Token (CAT) embedding to effectively capture
class-specific attributes in the training dataset. Experiments on PACS and Ima
geNet demonstrate that DDIS outperforms prior DFIS methods by generating
samples that better reflect the training data distribution, achieving SOTA
performance in data-free applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces NERO, an OOD detection approach that uses neuron-level relevance, outperforming existing methods in medical imaging tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance reliability in deep learning for medical imaging by effectively detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, crucial for identifying anomalies in diagnostic contexts.

Method: The paper proposes NERO, which utilizes neuron-level relevance clustering to create centroids for in-distribution (ID) classes. A relevance distance metric measures deviations, coupled with scaled relevance bias and feature norms for improved OOD detection.

Result: NERO demonstrates superior OOD detection performance on gastrointestinal imaging benchmarks (Kvasir and GastroVision) compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The NERO framework effectively improves OOD detection for medical imaging, offering enhanced reliability and explainability for diagnostic tasks.

Abstract: Ensuring reliability is paramount in deep learning, particularly within the
domain of medical imaging, where diagnostic decisions often hinge on model
outputs. The capacity to separate out-of-distribution (OOD) samples has proven
to be a valuable indicator of a model's reliability in research. In medical
imaging, this is especially critical, as identifying OOD inputs can help flag
potential anomalies that might otherwise go undetected. While many OOD
detection methods rely on feature or logit space representations, recent works
suggest these approaches may not fully capture OOD diversity. To address this,
we propose a novel OOD scoring mechanism, called NERO, that leverages
neuron-level relevance at the feature layer. Specifically, we cluster
neuron-level relevance for each in-distribution (ID) class to form
representative centroids and introduce a relevance distance metric to quantify
a new sample's deviation from these centroids, enhancing OOD separability.
Additionally, we refine performance by incorporating scaled relevance in the
bias term and combining feature norms. Our framework also enables explainable
OOD detection. We validate its effectiveness across multiple deep learning
architectures on the gastrointestinal imaging benchmarks Kvasir and
GastroVision, achieving improvements over state-of-the-art OOD detection
methods.

Motivation: The task of generating medical reports from imaging data remains complex, and large language models need better integration with visual data to improve performance.

Method: The authors developed MRG-LLM by combining a frozen LLM, a learnable visual encoder, and a dynamic prompt customization mechanism based on instance-specific visual features.

Result: MRG-LLM surpasses previous approaches, showing state-of-the-art performance on IU X-ray and MIMIC-CXR datasets in generating medical reports.

Conclusion: MRG-LLM is an effective solution for medical report generation, and its public code release will further support advancements in the field.

Abstract: Medical report generation from imaging data remains a challenging task in
clinical practice. While large language models (LLMs) show great promise in
addressing this challenge, their effective integration with medical imaging
data still deserves in-depth exploration. In this paper, we present MRG-LLM, a
novel multimodal large language model (MLLM) that combines a frozen LLM with a
learnable visual encoder and introduces a dynamic prompt customization
mechanism. Our key innovation lies in generating instance-specific prompts
tailored to individual medical images through conditional affine
transformations derived from visual features. We propose two implementations:
prompt-wise and promptbook-wise customization, enabling precise and targeted
report generation. Extensive experiments on IU X-ray and MIMIC-CXR datasets
demonstrate that MRG-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance in medical
report generation. Our code will be made publicly available.

*Shujia Li,Haiyu Zhang,Xinyuan Chen,Yaohui Wang,Yutong Ban*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GenHOI, a framework for generating high-quality 4D human-object interaction (HOI) sequences by combining keyframe reconstruction and a contact-aware diffusion model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of large-scale 4D human-object interaction datasets and enable generalization to unseen objects for high-quality HOI synthesis.

Method: The two-stage method uses Object-AnchorNet to reconstruct sparse 3D HOI keyframes and a Contact-Aware Diffusion Model (ContactDM) to interpolate these keyframes into dense 4D HOI sequences.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art results on OMOMO and 3D-FUTURE datasets, showcasing its ability to generalize to unseen objects and create high-fidelity 4D HOI sequences.

Conclusion: The proposed GenHOI framework effectively extends human motion synthesis techniques to the domain of 4D human-object interactions while overcoming the limitations posed by data scarcity.

Abstract: While diffusion models and large-scale motion datasets have advanced
text-driven human motion synthesis, extending these advances to 4D human-object
interaction (HOI) remains challenging, mainly due to the limited availability
of large-scale 4D HOI datasets. In our study, we introduce GenHOI, a novel
two-stage framework aimed at achieving two key objectives: 1) generalization to
unseen objects and 2) the synthesis of high-fidelity 4D HOI sequences. In the
initial stage of our framework, we employ an Object-AnchorNet to reconstruct
sparse 3D HOI keyframes for unseen objects, learning solely from 3D HOI
datasets, thereby mitigating the dependence on large-scale 4D HOI datasets.
Subsequently, we introduce a Contact-Aware Diffusion Model (ContactDM) in the
second stage to seamlessly interpolate sparse 3D HOI keyframes into densely
temporally coherent 4D HOI sequences. To enhance the quality of generated 4D
HOI sequences, we propose a novel Contact-Aware Encoder within ContactDM to
extract human-object contact patterns and a novel Contact-Aware HOI Attention
to effectively integrate the contact signals into diffusion models.
Experimental results show that we achieve state-of-the-art results on the
publicly available OMOMO and 3D-FUTURE datasets, demonstrating strong
generalization abilities to unseen objects, while enabling high-fidelity 4D HOI
generation.

*Farheen Ramzan,Yusuf Kiberu,Nikesh Jathanna,Shahnaz Jamil-Copley,Richard H. Clayton,Chen,Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces CLAIM, a framework that uses clinically guided augmentation to improve myocardial scar segmentation in cardiac MRI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenges of limited availability and variability of high-quality labeled LGE cardiac MRI images, which hinder robust myocardial scar segmentation.

Method: The CLAIM framework uses a clinically guided SMILE module with a diffusion-based generator to synthesize anatomically consistent scar patterns. The segmentation network is trained jointly with the generator to improve both scar synthesis and segmentation accuracy.

Result: CLAIM generates anatomically coherent scar patterns and achieves better Dice similarity with real scar distributions compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: CLAIM enhances myocardial scar segmentation by leveraging anatomically grounded synthesis, enabling improved medical imaging analysis for cardiac diseases.

Abstract: Deep learning-based myocardial scar segmentation from late gadolinium
enhancement (LGE) cardiac MRI has shown great potential for accurate and timely
diagnosis and treatment planning for structural cardiac diseases. However, the
limited availability and variability of LGE images with high-quality scar
labels restrict the development of robust segmentation models. To address this,
we introduce CLAIM: \textbf{C}linically-Guided \textbf{L}GE
\textbf{A}ugmentation for Real\textbf{i}stic and Diverse \textbf{M}yocardial
Scar Synthesis and Segmentation framework, a framework for anatomically
grounded scar generation and segmentation. At its core is the SMILE module
(Scar Mask generation guided by cLinical knowledgE), which conditions a
diffusion-based generator on the clinically adopted AHA 17-segment model to
synthesize images with anatomically consistent and spatially diverse scar
patterns. In addition, CLAIM employs a joint training strategy in which the
scar segmentation network is optimized alongside the generator, aiming to
enhance both the realism of synthesized scars and the accuracy of the scar
segmentation performance. Experimental results show that CLAIM produces
anatomically coherent scar patterns and achieves higher Dice similarity with
real scar distributions compared to baseline models. Our approach enables
controllable and realistic myocardial scar synthesis and has demonstrated
utility for downstream medical imaging task.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WinWinLay is a training-free method for layout-to-image generation, addressing challenges in localization and artifacts by introducing Non-local Attention Energy Function and adaptive updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Text-to-Image diffusion models face challenges like imprecise localization and unrealistic artifacts, necessitating solutions for precise scene layout control.

Method: WinWinLay uses Non-local Attention Energy Function to reduce spatial biases and Langevin dynamics-based adaptive update to mitigate out-of-distribution artifacts.

Result: WinWinLay demonstrates superior element placement control and photorealistic visual fidelity in experiments, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: WinWinLay significantly improves spatial control and realism in layout-to-image generation without requiring additional training.

Abstract: Layout-to-Image generation aims to create complex scenes with precise control
over the placement and arrangement of subjects. Existing works have
demonstrated that pre-trained Text-to-Image diffusion models can achieve this
goal without training on any specific data; however, they often face challenges
with imprecise localization and unrealistic artifacts. Focusing on these
drawbacks, we propose a novel training-free method, WinWinLay. At its core,
WinWinLay presents two key strategies, Non-local Attention Energy Function and
Adaptive Update, that collaboratively enhance control precision and realism. On
one hand, we theoretically demonstrate that the commonly used attention energy
function introduces inherent spatial distribution biases, hindering objects
from being uniformly aligned with layout instructions. To overcome this issue,
non-local attention prior is explored to redistribute attention scores,
facilitating objects to better conform to the specified spatial conditions. On
the other hand, we identify that the vanilla backpropagation update rule can
cause deviations from the pre-trained domain, leading to out-of-distribution
artifacts. We accordingly introduce a Langevin dynamics-based adaptive update
scheme as a remedy that promotes in-domain updating while respecting layout
constraints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WinWinLay excels in
controlling element placement and achieving photorealistic visual fidelity,
outperforming the current state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of accurately identifying graphical implicit correlations in multimodal irony detection tasks.

Method: The method employs a model (SemIRNet) with three innovations: the integration of ConceptNet for conceptual knowledge, word/sentence-level cross-modal semantic detection, and a contrastive learning loss to enhance feature separability.

Result: SemIRNet improved accuracy by 1.64% and F1 by 2.88% on a public dataset compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Introducing knowledge fusion and semantic similarity detection significantly enhances multimodal irony detection effectiveness.

Abstract: Aiming at the problem of difficulty in accurately identifying graphical
implicit correlations in multimodal irony detection tasks, this paper proposes
a Semantic Irony Recognition Network (SemIRNet). The model contains three main
innovations: (1) The ConceptNet knowledge base is introduced for the first time
to acquire conceptual knowledge, which enhances the model's common-sense
reasoning ability; (2) Two cross-modal semantic similarity detection modules at
the word level and sample level are designed to model graphic-textual
correlations at different granularities; and (3) A contrastive learning loss
function is introduced to optimize the spatial distribution of the sample
features, which improves the separability of positive and negative samples.
Experiments on a publicly available multimodal irony detection benchmark
dataset show that the accuracy and F1 value of this model are improved by 1.64%
and 2.88% to 88.87% and 86.33%, respectively, compared with the existing
optimal methods. Further ablation experiments verify the important role of
knowledge fusion and semantic similarity detection in improving the model
performance.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a semi-supervised segmentation framework for ultra-high resolution land cover classification, achieving superior accuracy while being parameter-efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges of high annotation costs, scale variation, and limited adaptability in ultra-high resolution land imagery segmentation under weak supervision.

Method: The authors propose a semi-supervised framework using SAM2 and a domain-specific FreqWeaver Adapter to enhance fine-grained detail modeling with just 5.96% additional model parameters.

Result: The model improves segmentation performance with a 1.78% increase compared to existing methods and a 3.44% gain over state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: This method efficiently enhances segmentation of 0.3 m resolution imagery, advancing fine-grained land cover analysis while minimizing computational overhead.

Abstract: Ultra-high Spatial Resolution Land Cover Classification is essential for
fine-grained land cover analysis, yet it remains challenging due to the high
cost of pixel-level annotations, significant scale variation, and the limited
adaptability of large-scale vision models. Existing methods typically focus on
1-meter spatial resolution imagery and rely heavily on annotated data, whereas
practical applications often require processing higher-resolution imagery under
weak supervision. To address this, we propose a parameter-efficient
semi-supervised segmentation framework for 0.3 m spatial resolution imagery,
which leverages the knowledge of SAM2 and introduces a remote sensing-specific
FreqWeaver Adapter to enhance fine-grained detail modeling while maintaining a
lightweight design at only 5.96% of the total model parameters. By effectively
leveraging unlabeled data and maintaining minimal parameter overhead, the
proposed method delivers robust segmentation results with superior structural
consistency, achieving a 1.78% improvement over existing parameter-efficient
tuning strategies and a 3.44% gain compared to state-of-the-art high-resolution
remote sensing segmentation approaches.

*Di Wang,Shi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel graph-based framework for end-to-end processing of large-scale point clouds for forest above-ground biomass (AGB) estimation, offering scalability and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Forest AGB estimation is vital for carbon storage assessment and sustainable forest management. Current methods have limitations such as reliance on high-quality data and complex pre-processing.

Method: The study uses an innovative graph-based pipeline integrating tree segmentation, leaf-wood separation, and 3D skeletal reconstruction using graph operations.

Result: Validation shows strong performance with relative errors of ~20% in leaf-on conditions and ~30% in low-density UAV-based laser scanning datasets.

Conclusion: The framework improves scalability and practicality for AGB estimation, reduces reliance on pre-processing tools, and broadens applications in forest management and climate research.

Abstract: Estimating forest above-ground biomass (AGB) is crucial for assessing carbon
storage and supporting sustainable forest management. Quantitative Structural
Model (QSM) offers a non-destructive approach to AGB estimation through 3D tree
structural reconstruction. However, current QSM methods face significant
limitations, as they are primarily designed for individual trees,depend on
high-quality point cloud data from terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), and also
require multiple pre-processing steps that hinder scalability and practical
deployment. This study presents a novel unified framework that enables
end-to-end processing of large-scale point clouds using an innovative
graph-based pipeline. The proposed approach seamlessly integrates tree
segmentation,leaf-wood separation and 3D skeletal reconstruction through
dedicated graph operations including pathing and abstracting for tree topology
reasoning. Comprehensive validation was conducted on datasets with varying leaf
conditions (leaf-on and leaf-off), spatial scales (tree- and plot-level), and
data sources (TLS and UAV-based laser scanning, ULS). Experimental results
demonstrate strong performance under challenging conditions, particularly in
leaf-on scenarios (~20% relative error) and low-density ULS datasets with
partial coverage (~30% relative error). These findings indicate that the
proposed framework provides a robust and scalable solution for large-scale,
non-destructive AGB estimation. It significantly reduces dependency on
specialized pre-processing tools and establishes ULS as a viable alternative to
TLS. To our knowledge, this is the first method capable of enabling seamless,
end-to-end 3D tree reconstruction at operational scales. This advancement
substantially improves the feasibility of QSM-based AGB estimation, paving the
way for broader applications in forest inventory and climate change research.

*Yujing Sun,Lingchen Sun,Shuaizheng Liu,Rongyuan Wu,Zhengqiang Zhang,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses video super-resolution challenges by proposing a new Dual LoRA Learning (DLoRAL) framework integrated with stable diffusion models, achieving high-quality temporal consistency and spatial details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance real-world video super-resolution (Real-VSR) with realistic spatial details while maintaining temporal consistency, addressing current limitations of SD-based methods.

Method: The paper introduces a two-phase iterative training: (1) Consistency-LoRA (C-LoRA) learns temporal consistency from degraded videos using a Cross-Frame Retrieval (CFR) module, (2) Detail-LoRA (D-LoRA) enhances spatial details while respecting C-LoRA's temporal consistency priors. Both modules merge into SD for efficient single-step restoration.

Result: The proposed DLoRAL framework achieves high visual quality and strong temporal consistency in Real-VSR tasks. It also offers high computational efficiency during inference.

Conclusion: DLoRAL proves effective in addressing Real-VSR challenges, providing a novel approach combining temporal consistency and high spatial resolution, and achieves robust and efficient video restoration.

Abstract: It is a challenging problem to reproduce rich spatial details while
maintaining temporal consistency in real-world video super-resolution
(Real-VSR), especially when we leverage pre-trained generative models such as
stable diffusion (SD) for realistic details synthesis. Existing SD-based
Real-VSR methods often compromise spatial details for temporal coherence,
resulting in suboptimal visual quality. We argue that the key lies in how to
effectively extract the degradation-robust temporal consistency priors from the
low-quality (LQ) input video and enhance the video details while maintaining
the extracted consistency priors. To achieve this, we propose a Dual LoRA
Learning (DLoRAL) paradigm to train an effective SD-based one-step diffusion
model, achieving realistic frame details and temporal consistency
simultaneously. Specifically, we introduce a Cross-Frame Retrieval (CFR) module
to aggregate complementary information across frames, and train a
Consistency-LoRA (C-LoRA) to learn robust temporal representations from
degraded inputs. After consistency learning, we fix the CFR and C-LoRA modules
and train a Detail-LoRA (D-LoRA) to enhance spatial details while aligning with
the temporal space defined by C-LoRA to keep temporal coherence. The two phases
alternate iteratively for optimization, collaboratively delivering consistent
and detail-rich outputs. During inference, the two LoRA branches are merged
into the SD model, allowing efficient and high-quality video restoration in a
single diffusion step. Experiments show that DLoRAL achieves strong performance
in both accuracy and speed. Code and models are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M2M-Reg is a new framework for multi-modal image registration that improves alignment between highly heterogeneous imaging modalities like PET-MRI and FA-MRI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unsupervised image registration methods often falter due to poor metrics for aligning heterogeneous imaging modalities like PET and MRI.

Method: M2M-Reg trains multi-modal image registration models using mono-modal similarity, introduces a GradCyCon regularizer for diffeomorphic mappings, and supports a semi-supervised approach.

Result: On the ADNI dataset, M2M-Reg achieves up to 2x higher DSC scores compared to earlier methods for PET-MRI and FA-MRI registration.

Conclusion: M2M-Reg significantly improves multi-modal image alignment while preserving architectural compatibility and extending to semi-supervised scenarios.

Abstract: In clinical practice, imaging modalities with functional characteristics,
such as positron emission tomography (PET) and fractional anisotropy (FA), are
often aligned with a structural reference (e.g., MRI, CT) for accurate
interpretation or group analysis, necessitating multi-modal deformable image
registration (DIR). However, due to the extreme heterogeneity of these
modalities compared to standard structural scans, conventional unsupervised DIR
methods struggle to learn reliable spatial mappings and often distort images.
We find that the similarity metrics guiding these models fail to capture
alignment between highly disparate modalities. To address this, we propose
M2M-Reg (Multi-to-Mono Registration), a novel framework that trains multi-modal
DIR models using only mono-modal similarity while preserving the established
architectural paradigm for seamless integration into existing models. We also
introduce GradCyCon, a regularizer that leverages M2M-Reg's cyclic training
scheme to promote diffeomorphism. Furthermore, our framework naturally extends
to a semi-supervised setting, integrating pre-aligned and unaligned pairs only,
without requiring ground-truth transformations or segmentation masks.
Experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset
demonstrate that M2M-Reg achieves up to 2x higher DSC than prior methods for
PET-MRI and FA-MRI registration, highlighting its effectiveness in handling
highly heterogeneous multi-modal DIR. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a reconstruction-free, online framework for efficient and real-time 3D object detection using posed RGB-D video inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D object detection are computationally intensive and memory-consuming, limiting their real-time application in scenarios like autonomous driving and embodied AI.

Method: The framework employs Cubify Anything for single-view 3D bounding box detection, CLIP for open-vocabulary semantics capture, and modules for multi-view box association and fusion using particle filtering optimization.

Result: Experiments on ScanNetV2 and CA-1M datasets show state-of-the-art performance compared to other online methods, demonstrating high generalization across various environments.

Conclusion: The proposed framework achieves efficient and real-time 3D object detection without dense point cloud reconstruction, generalizing well in diverse scenarios including large-scale spaces.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D object detection has gained significant interest due to
its critical applications in autonomous driving and embodied AI. Existing
detection methods, whether offline or online, typically rely on dense point
cloud reconstruction, which imposes substantial computational overhead and
memory constraints, hindering real-time deployment in downstream tasks. To
address this, we propose a novel reconstruction-free online framework tailored
for memory-efficient and real-time 3D detection. Specifically, given streaming
posed RGB-D video input, we leverage Cubify Anything as a pre-trained visual
foundation model (VFM) for single-view 3D object detection by bounding boxes,
coupled with CLIP to capture open-vocabulary semantics of detected objects. To
fuse all detected bounding boxes across different views into a unified one, we
employ an association module for correspondences of multi-views and an
optimization module to fuse the 3D bounding boxes of the same instance
predicted in multi-views. The association module utilizes 3D Non-Maximum
Suppression (NMS) and a box correspondence matching module, while the
optimization module uses an IoU-guided efficient random optimization technique
based on particle filtering to enforce multi-view consistency of the 3D
bounding boxes while minimizing computational complexity. Extensive experiments
on ScanNetV2 and CA-1M datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance among online methods. Benefiting from this novel
reconstruction-free paradigm for 3D object detection, our method exhibits great
generalization abilities in various scenarios, enabling real-time perception
even in environments exceeding 1000 square meters.

*Roey Ron,Guy Tevet,Haim Sawdayee,Amit H. Bermano*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HOIDiNi, a text-driven diffusion framework for realistic human-object interaction (HOI) generation, using a novel Diffusion Noise Optimization (DNO) method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of generating realistic human-object interactions that balance physical correctness with natural motion, filling a gap where existing methods trade off between realism and accuracy.

Method: HOIDiNi optimizes in the noise space of a pretrained diffusion model using DNO. The process is divided into two phases: an object-centric phase for hand-object contact decisions and a human-centric phase for refining full-body motion.

Result: HOIDiNi outperforms existing methods in contact accuracy, physical realism, and overall quality as demonstrated on the GRAB dataset, enabling complex and controllable interactions driven by textual prompts.

Conclusion: HOIDiNi achieves a significant advancement in HOI generation by combining structured phases with DNO, achieving realistic and physically valid results guided by text.

Abstract: We present HOIDiNi, a text-driven diffusion framework for synthesizing
realistic and plausible human-object interaction (HOI). HOI generation is
extremely challenging since it induces strict contact accuracies alongside a
diverse motion manifold. While current literature trades off between realism
and physical correctness, HOIDiNi optimizes directly in the noise space of a
pretrained diffusion model using Diffusion Noise Optimization (DNO), achieving
both. This is made feasible thanks to our observation that the problem can be
separated into two phases: an object-centric phase, primarily making discrete
choices of hand-object contact locations, and a human-centric phase that
refines the full-body motion to realize this blueprint. This structured
approach allows for precise hand-object contact without compromising motion
naturalness. Quantitative, qualitative, and subjective evaluations on the GRAB
dataset alone clearly indicate HOIDiNi outperforms prior works and baselines in
contact accuracy, physical validity, and overall quality. Our results
demonstrate the ability to generate complex, controllable interactions,
including grasping, placing, and full-body coordination, driven solely by
textual prompts. https://hoidini.github.io.

### [127] [Demystifying the Visual Quality Paradox in Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15645)
*Shuo Xing,Lanqing Guo,Hongyuan Hua,Seoyoung Lee,Peiran Li,Yufei Wang,Zhangyang Wang,Zhengzhong Tu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates how the quality of input images affects multimodal large language models (MLLMs), uncovering a paradox where less visually accurate images can yield better performance. To address this, the authors propose Visual-Quality Test-Time Tuning (VQ-TTT), a lightweight method for image adaptation that improves model accuracy without additional resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and optimize how input visual quality affects the performance of MLLMs, given the unexpected observation that higher human-perceived image quality does not always translate to better model responses.

Method: The authors perform a systematic study of MLLMs with controlled degradations and stylistic shifts in images, and propose Visual-Quality Test-Time Tuning (VQ-TTT), which involves a learnable low-rank kernel to adjust frequency content and fine-tuning shallow layers of the vision encoder using LoRA.

Result: VQ-TTT significantly improves accuracy across various MLLMs and datasets without relying on external models, cached features, or additional training data.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the need for adaptive visual inputs tailored to model-specific preferences, challenging the traditional approach of relying on universally clean imagery for MLLMs.

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel on benchmark
vision-language tasks, yet little is known about how input visual quality
shapes their responses. Does higher perceptual quality of images already
translate to better MLLM understanding? We conduct the first systematic study
spanning leading MLLMs and a suite of vision-language benchmarks, applying
controlled degradations and stylistic shifts to each image. Surprisingly, we
uncover a visual-quality paradox: model, task, and even individual-instance
performance can improve when images deviate from human-perceived fidelity.
Off-the-shelf restoration pipelines fail to reconcile these idiosyncratic
preferences. To close the gap, we introduce Visual-Quality Test-Time Tuning
(VQ-TTT)-a lightweight adaptation module that: (1) inserts a learnable,
low-rank kernel before the frozen vision encoder to modulate frequency content;
and (2) fine-tunes only shallow vision-encoder layers via LoRA. VQ-TTT
dynamically adjusts each input image in a single forward pass, aligning it with
task-specific model preferences. Across the evaluated MLLMs and all datasets,
VQ-TTT lifts significant average accuracy, with no external models, cached
features, or extra training data. These findings redefine ``better'' visual
inputs for MLLMs and highlight the need for adaptive, rather than universally
``clean'', imagery, in the new era of AI being the main data customer.

*Ankan Deria,Adinath Madhavrao Dukre,Feilong Tang,Sara Atito,Sudipta Roy,Muhammad Awais,Muhammad Haris Khan,Imran Razzak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViMaR is a new inference framework improving the efficiency and accuracy of vision-language models (VLMs) by penalizing low-confidence outputs and using selective refinement for captions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models suffer from inefficiency and persistent hallucinations due to low-confidence generations.

Method: ViMaR employs a two-stage approach: 1) identifies optimal captions using a value model and 2) selectively refines weak segments with margin-based penalties.

Result: ViMaR achieves a 4x speedup, improves caption reliability, fact accuracy, and detail quality, and validates cross-model generalization and scalability.

Conclusion: ViMaR enhances VLM pipelines by delivering faster, more accurate, and self-improving visual comprehension capabilities while being transferable across architectures.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in inference-time search for vision-language
models (VLMs), existing approaches remain both computationally expensive and
prone to unpenalized, low-confidence generations which often lead to persistent
hallucinations. We introduce \textbf{Value-guided Inference with Margin-based
Reward (ViMaR)}, a two-stage inference framework that improves both efficiency
and output fidelity by combining a temporal-difference value model with a
margin-aware reward adjustment. In the first stage, we perform a single pass to
identify the highest-value caption among diverse candidates. In the second
stage, we selectively refine only those segments that were overlooked or
exhibit weak visual grounding, thereby eliminating frequently rewarded
evaluations. A calibrated margin-based penalty discourages low-confidence
continuations while preserving descriptive richness. Extensive experiments
across multiple VLM architectures demonstrate that ViMaR generates captions
that are significantly more reliable, factually accurate, detailed, and
explanatory, while achieving over 4$\times$ speedup compared to existing
value-guided methods. Specifically, we show that ViMaR trained solely on LLaVA
Mistral-7B, \textit{generalizes effectively to guide decoding in a stronger
unseen model}. To further validate this, we adapt the ViMaR to steer generation
in LLaVA-OneVision-Qwen2-7B, leading to consistent improvements in caption
quality and demonstrating robust cross-model guidance. This cross-model
generalization highlights ViMaR's flexibility and modularity, positioning it as
a scalable and transferable inference-time decoding strategy. Furthermore, when
ViMaR-generated captions are used for self-training, the underlying models
achieve substantial gains across a broad suite of visual comprehension
benchmarks, underscoring the potential of fast, accurate, and self-improving
VLM pipelines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper develops a generative diffusion model for relighting images and videos in a single pass, achieving high-quality results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study targets the significant challenge of relighting single images or videos while enhancing visual realism and adaptability across diverse scenes.

Method: The approach combines generative video diffusion models to jointly estimate albedo and synthesize relit outputs, using synthetic multi-illumination data paired with labeled real-world videos.

Result: The model outperforms prior methods by showcasing superior visual fidelity and temporal consistency across various domains.

Conclusion: The integrated diffusion-based model successfully addresses intrinsic scene understanding and produces realistic lighting effects such as shadows, reflections, and transparency.

Abstract: We address the challenge of relighting a single image or video, a task that
demands precise scene intrinsic understanding and high-quality light transport
synthesis. Existing end-to-end relighting models are often limited by the
scarcity of paired multi-illumination data, restricting their ability to
generalize across diverse scenes. Conversely, two-stage pipelines that combine
inverse and forward rendering can mitigate data requirements but are
susceptible to error accumulation and often fail to produce realistic outputs
under complex lighting conditions or with sophisticated materials. In this
work, we introduce a general-purpose approach that jointly estimates albedo and
synthesizes relit outputs in a single pass, harnessing the generative
capabilities of video diffusion models. This joint formulation enhances
implicit scene comprehension and facilitates the creation of realistic lighting
effects and intricate material interactions, such as shadows, reflections, and
transparency. Trained on synthetic multi-illumination data and extensive
automatically labeled real-world videos, our model demonstrates strong
generalization across diverse domains and surpasses previous methods in both
visual fidelity and temporal consistency.

TL;DR: The paper presents Sekai, a comprehensive video dataset designed to facilitate world exploration using first-person perspectives from over 100 countries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing video generation datasets for interactive world exploration, such as restricted locations, static scenes, and lacking annotations.

Method: Developed an efficient toolbox for collecting, pre-processing, and annotating over 5,000 hours of FPV/UAV videos with details like location, weather, and trajectories.

Result: Sekai dataset offers rich annotations and diverse global coverage; experiments validate its quality, and a subset is utilized to train the interactive exploration model ‘YUME.’

Conclusion: Sekai enhances video generation potential for world exploration and could lead to impactful applications in this area.

Abstract: Video generation techniques have made remarkable progress, promising to be
the foundation of interactive world exploration. However, existing video
generation datasets are not well-suited for world exploration training as they
suffer from some limitations: limited locations, short duration, static scenes,
and a lack of annotations about exploration and the world. In this paper, we
introduce Sekai (meaning ``world'' in Japanese), a high-quality first-person
view worldwide video dataset with rich annotations for world exploration. It
consists of over 5,000 hours of walking or drone view (FPV and UVA) videos from
over 100 countries and regions across 750 cities. We develop an efficient and
effective toolbox to collect, pre-process and annotate videos with location,
scene, weather, crowd density, captions, and camera trajectories. Experiments
demonstrate the quality of the dataset. And, we use a subset to train an
interactive video world exploration model, named YUME (meaning ``dream'' in
Japanese). We believe Sekai will benefit the area of video generation and world
exploration, and motivate valuable applications.

*Anirud Aggarwal,Abhinav Shrivastava,Matthew Gwilliam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method called ECAD to accelerate diffusion-based image generation without sacrificing quality. It uses a genetic algorithm to optimize caching schedules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of slow and computationally expensive inference in diffusion-based image generation models, which hinders their practical applications.

Method: The authors introduce ECAD, a genetic algorithm that generates efficient caching schedules tailored to specific models and tasks, using a small number of calibration prompts. The approach requires no modification to the model and is adaptable across architectures.

Result: ECAD achieves better quality-latency trade-offs compared to existing methods, as demonstrated by improved COCO FID and inference speedup in benchmarks like PixArt and FLUX. For example, it showed a 4.47 improvement in COCO FID and a speedup increase from 2.35x to 2.58x on PixArt-alpha.

Conclusion: ECAD is a scalable, generalizable approach that significantly enhances the speed and quality of diffusion model inference, making these models more practical for diverse applications.

Abstract: Diffusion-based image generation models excel at producing high-quality
synthetic content, but suffer from slow and computationally expensive
inference. Prior work has attempted to mitigate this by caching and reusing
features within diffusion transformers across inference steps. These methods,
however, often rely on rigid heuristics that result in limited acceleration or
poor generalization across architectures. We propose Evolutionary Caching to
Accelerate Diffusion models (ECAD), a genetic algorithm that learns efficient,
per-model, caching schedules forming a Pareto frontier, using only a small set
of calibration prompts. ECAD requires no modifications to network parameters or
reference images. It offers significant inference speedups, enables
fine-grained control over the quality-latency trade-off, and adapts seamlessly
to different diffusion models. Notably, ECAD's learned schedules can generalize
effectively to resolutions and model variants not seen during calibration. We
evaluate ECAD on PixArt-alpha, PixArt-Sigma, and FLUX-1.dev using multiple
metrics (FID, CLIP, Image Reward) across diverse benchmarks (COCO, MJHQ-30k,
PartiPrompts), demonstrating consistent improvements over previous approaches.
On PixArt-alpha, ECAD identifies a schedule that outperforms the previous
state-of-the-art method by 4.47 COCO FID while increasing inference speedup
from 2.35x to 2.58x. Our results establish ECAD as a scalable and generalizable
approach for accelerating diffusion inference. Our project website is available

### [132] [Parallel Data Object Creation: Towards Scalable Metadata Management in High-Performance I/O Library](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15114)
*Youjia Li,Robert Latham,Robert Ross,Ankit Agrawal,Alok Choudhary,Wei-Keng Liao*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new file header format for PnetCDF to allow scalable and independent creation of large volumes of data objects, achieving up to 582x faster performance and reduced memory footprints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-level I/O libraries like HDF5 and PnetCDF struggle with efficient and independent creation of a large number of data objects by multiple processes due to metadata consistency checks, which is particularly problematic for large-scale scientific applications with diverse data sizes.

Method: The authors introduced a new file header format incorporating an index table and metadata blocks to support independent and collective creation of data objects, modifying PnetCDF while adhering to the netCDF file format.

Result: The proposed header format significantly improved scalability and performance, reducing data object creation time by up to 582x in tests involving 4096 MPI processes and 5,684,800 objects, while also decreasing memory requirements per process.

Conclusion: This innovative design enables efficient independent data object creation, offering a scalable solution for applications requiring parallel I/O, such as scientific simulations and high-energy physics experiments.

Abstract: High-level I/O libraries, such as HDF5 and PnetCDF, are commonly used by
large-scale scientific applications to perform I/O tasks in parallel. These I/O
libraries store the metadata such as data types and dimensionality along with
the raw data in the same files. While these libraries are well-optimized for
concurrent access to the raw data, they are designed neither to handle a large
number of data objects efficiently nor to create different data objects
independently by multiple processes, as they require applications to call data
object creation APIs collectively with consistent metadata among all processes.
Applications that process data gathered from remote sensors, such as particle
collision experiments in high-energy physics, may generate data of different
sizes from different sensors and desire to store them as separate data objects.
For such applications, the I/O library's requirement on collective data object
creation can become very expensive, as the cost of metadata consistency check
increases with the metadata volume as well as the number of processes. To
address this limitation, using PnetCDF as an experimental platform, we
investigate solutions in this paper that abide the netCDF file format, as well
as propose a new file header format that enables independent data object
creation. The proposed file header consists of two sections, an index table and
a list of metadata blocks. The index table contains the reference to the
metadata blocks and each block stores metadata of objects that can be created
collectively or independently. The new design achieves a scalable performance,
cutting data object creation times by up to 582x when running on 4096 MPI
processes to create 5,684,800 data objects in parallel. Additionally, the new
method reduces the memory footprints, with each process requiring an amount of
memory space inversely proportional to the number of processes.

*Jiale Xu,Rui Zhang,Yi Xiong,Cong Guo,Zihan Liu,Yangjie Zhou,Weiming Hu,Hao Wu,Changxu Shao,Ziqing Wang,Yongjie Yuan,Junping Zhao,Minyi Guo,Jingwen Leng*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper proposes eLLM, a memory management framework to improve memory efficiency in serving LLMs, achieving 2.32x throughput and managing larger batch sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from inefficiencies in memory management for LLM serving systems, particularly the suboptimal separation between runtime memory and KV cache management, which can cause up to a 20% throughput drop.

Method: The method involves designing eLLM with three key components: (1) Virtual Tensor Abstraction for a unified memory pool, (2) Elastic Memory Mechanism for dynamic memory adjustments via GPU and CPU memory, and (3) a Lightweight Scheduling Strategy for SLO-aware optimization of memory usage.

Result: The results show that eLLM offers 2.32x higher decoding throughput and supports batch sizes that are 3x larger for 128K-token inputs compared to current solutions.

Conclusion: eLLM offers a robust solution to memory management challenges in LLMs, substantially improving throughput and scalability, while managing performance trade-offs under strict SLO constraints.

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly being deployed in datacenters. Serving
these models requires careful memory management, as their memory usage includes
static weights, dynamic activations, and key-value caches. While static weights
are constant and predictable, dynamic components such as activations and KV
caches change frequently during runtime, presenting significant challenges for
efficient memory management. Modern LLM serving systems typically handle
runtime memory and KV caches at distinct abstraction levels: runtime memory
management relies on static tensor abstractions, whereas KV caches utilize a
page table-based virtualization layer built on top of the tensor abstraction.
This virtualization dynamically manages KV caches to mitigate memory
fragmentation. However, this dual-level approach fundamentally isolates runtime
memory and KV cache management, resulting in suboptimal memory utilization
under dynamic workloads, which can lead to a nearly 20% drop in throughput.
  To address these limitations, we propose eLLM, an elastic memory management
framework inspired by the classical memory ballooning mechanism in operating
systems. The core components of eLLM include: (1) Virtual Tensor Abstraction,
which decouples the virtual address space of tensors from the physical GPU
memory, creating a unified and flexible memory pool; (2) an Elastic Memory
Mechanism that dynamically adjusts memory allocation through runtime memory
inflation and deflation, leveraging CPU memory as an extensible buffer; and (3)
a Lightweight Scheduling Strategy employing SLO-aware policies to optimize
memory utilization and effectively balance performance trade-offs under
stringent SLO constraints. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that eLLM
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art systems, 2.32x higher decoding
throughput, and supporting 3x larger batch sizes for 128K-token inputs.

TL;DR: This paper discusses porting the Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm to a RISC-V based accelerator, comparing it to traditional CPUs in terms of efficiency and energy usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the potential of RISC-V accelerators, particularly the Tenstorrent Wormhole PCIe, in achieving power and energy efficiency for HPC workloads while maintaining acceptable performance.

Method: The authors ported the Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm to the Tenstorrent Wormhole PCIe RISC-V based accelerator and applied optimization techniques to mitigate data movement bottlenecks. They compared the performance, power, and energy consumption to a Xeon Platinum CPU.

Result: The RISC-V Wormhole n300 accelerator performed slower than the Xeon CPU for a 2D FFT, but it consumed significantly less power (8x) and energy (2.8x).

Conclusion: While RISC-V accelerators like the Wormhole n300 are slower than high-end CPUs, they offer substantial energy efficiency benefits, highlighting their potential for specialized HPC tasks.

Abstract: Whilst numerous areas of computing have adopted the RISC-V Instruction Set
Architecture (ISA) wholesale in recent years, it is yet to become widespread in
HPC. RISC-V accelerators offer a compelling option where the HPC community can
benefit from the specialisation offered by the open nature of the standard but
without the extensive ecosystem changes required when adopting RISC-V CPUs. In
this paper we explore porting the Cooley-Tukey Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
algorithm to the Tenstorrent Wormhole PCIe RISC-V based accelerator. Built upon
Tenstorrent's Tensix architecture, this technology decouples the movement of
data from compute, potentially offering increased control to the programmer.
Exploring different optimisation techniques to address the bottlenecks inherent
in data movement, we demonstrate that for a 2D FFT whilst the Wormhole n300 is
slower than a server-grade 24-core Xeon Platinum CPU, the Wormhole draws around
8 times less power and consumes around 2.8 times less energy than the CPU when
computing the Fourier transform.

Motivation: To guide developers in selecting the most suitable parallel programming models for heterogeneous HPC systems amid increasing architectural complexity.

Method: Systematic analysis and comparison across several dimensions, including performance evaluations in scientific simulations, machine learning, and data analytics.

Result: MPI excels in scalability for distributed memory, OpenMP is effective for shared-memory tasks, CUDA offers GPU performance gains, and hybrid models often perform best for heterogeneous environments.

Conclusion: The choice of programming model should align with application, hardware, and constraints, with hybrid approaches often most suitable for optimizing results in complex HPC environments.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive comparison of three dominant parallel
programming models in High Performance Computing (HPC): Message Passing
Interface (MPI), Open Multi-Processing (OpenMP), and Compute Unified Device
Architecture (CUDA). Selecting optimal programming approaches for modern
heterogeneous HPC architectures has become increasingly critical. We
systematically analyze these models across multiple dimensions: architectural
foundations, performance characteristics, domain-specific suitability,
programming complexity, and recent advancements. We examine each model's
strengths, weaknesses, and optimization techniques. Our investigation
demonstrates that MPI excels in distributed memory environments with
near-linear scalability for communication-intensive applications, but faces
communication overhead challenges. OpenMP provides strong performance and
usability in shared-memory systems and loop-centric tasks, though it is limited
by shared memory contention. CUDA offers substantial performance gains for
data-parallel GPU workloads, but is restricted to NVIDIA GPUs and requires
specialized expertise. Performance evaluations across scientific simulations,
machine learning, and data analytics reveal that hybrid approaches combining
two or more models often yield optimal results in heterogeneous environments.
The paper also discusses implementation challenges, optimization best
practices, and emerging trends such as performance portability frameworks,
task-based programming, and the convergence of HPC and Big Data. This research
helps developers and researchers make informed decisions when selecting

*Nikolay Blagoev,Oğuzhan Ersoy,Lydia Yiyu Chen*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces CheckFree, a failure recovery method for training LLMs on decentralized nodes, requiring no additional computation or storage compared to alternatives like checkpointing and redundant computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to reduce the cost of training LLMs on decentralized and wimpy nodes while addressing challenges of node failures without heavy computational or storage overheads.

Method: CheckFree replaces a failing stage with a weighted average of neighboring stages, and CheckFree+ extends this to tolerate crashes of first and last stages with out-of-order pipelining and small storage overhead.

Result: CheckFree and CheckFree+ outperform checkpointing and redundant computation in convergence time by over 12% for low and medium failure rates.

Conclusion: The proposed methods enable efficient and cost-effective LLM training on decentralized nodes with improved failure recovery performance and minimal overheads.

Abstract: Training LLMs on decentralized and wimpy computation nodes, e.g., multiple
on-spot instances, lowers the training cost and enables model democratization.
The inevitable challenge here is the churn of nodes due to failures and the
operator's scheduling policies, leading to losing a stage - a part of the
model. The conventional approaches to recover from failures are to either use
checkpointing, where periodically a copy of the entire model is sent to an
additional storage, or redundant computation. These approaches yield
significant communication and/or computation overhead even in non-failure cases
and scale poorly in settings with large models. In this paper, we propose,
CheckFree, an efficient recovery method where a failing stage is substituted by
a weighted average of the closest neighboring stages. In contrast to the state
of the art, CheckFree requires no additional computation or storage. However,
because of the nature of averaging neighbouring stages, it can only recover
failures of intermediate stages. We further extend our method to CheckFree+
with out-of-order pipeline execution to tolerate crashes of the first and last
stages. Thanks to out-of-order pipelining, behaviour of those stages is
mimicked by their neighboring ones, which allows CheckFree+ to recover them by
simply copying the weights from the immediate neighbour. To be able to recover
the (de)embedding layers, CheckFree+ copies those layers to the neighboring
stages, which requires relatively small storage overhead. We extensively
evaluate our method on LLaMa models of model sizes from 124M to 1.5B with
varying failure frequencies. In the case of low and medium failure rates
(5-10%), CheckFree and CheckFree+ outperform both checkpointing and redundant
computation in terms of convergence in wall-clock time by over 12%. Both of our
proposals can be run via our code available at:
https://github.com/gensyn-ai/CheckFree.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the parallel communication cost of multiplying a vector along two modes of a 3D symmetric tensor, key in tensor computations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and minimize the data movement required during parallel computation for symmetric tensor operations, especially in eigenpair identification and CP decomposition.

Method: Communication lower bounds are derived using a geometric inequality extension for symmetric computations. An optimal algorithm is proposed based on a triangle block partition scheme.

Result: The derived communication lower bounds are shown to be tight by verifying them with the designed optimal algorithm.

Conclusion: The study provides both theoretical bounds and practical algorithms to optimize communication costs in symmetric tensor computations.

Abstract: In this article, we focus on the parallel communication cost of multiplying
the same vector along two modes of a $3$-dimensional symmetric tensor. This is
a key computation in the higher-order power method for determining eigenpairs
of a $3$-dimensional symmetric tensor and in gradient-based methods for
computing a symmetric CP decomposition. We establish communication lower bounds
that determine how much data movement is required to perform the specified
computation in parallel. The core idea of the proof relies on extending a key
geometric inequality for $3$-dimensional symmetric computations. We demonstrate
that the communication lower bounds are tight by presenting an optimal
algorithm where the data distribution is a natural extension of the triangle
block partition scheme for symmetric matrices to 3-dimensional symmetric
tensors.

TL;DR: LiteGD introduces a dynamic GPU dispatching system leveraging a transformer-based network to optimize inter-GPU bandwidth efficacy, surpassing traditional GPU allocation methods in large-scale heterogeneous clusters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning tasks, particularly large language models, demand efficient inter-GPU communication in large-scale, heterogeneous GPU clusters, challenging the traditional practice of GPU allocation based solely on physical proximity.

Method: LiteGD employs a transformer network to process sampled GPU topology data, coupled with a bidirectional tree search for near-optimal GPU dispatching, balancing computational efficiency and scalability.

Result: LiteGD demonstrates approximately 90% bandwidth efficacy in various simulated clusters and 80% in real-world H100 clusters, outperforming topology-aware dispatch methods, especially in heterogeneous environments.

Conclusion: LiteGD achieves superior performance, showcasing its scalability and adaptability for GPU dispatching in complex and large-scale environments.

Abstract: Parallel computing with multiple GPUs has become the dominant paradigm for
machine learning tasks, especially those of large language models (LLMs). To
reduce the latency incurred by inter-GPU communication, a common practice for
parallel tasks has been to allocate GPUs based on their physical proximity.
However, this long-standing assumption has notable limitations, particularly in
large-scale, heterogeneous GPU clusters where bandwidth distribution among GPUs
is irregular. In this paper, we introduce LiteGD, a lightweight and dynamic GPU
dispatching system based on global perspectives. To tackle the difficulty of
storing massive GPU topology information, LiteGD adopts a computation-aware
design that leverages a lightweight Transformer network trained on sampled
data. Our customized design for network structure ensures both transferability
and scalability. LiteGD also employs a bidirectional tree search approach to
find the optimal GPU dispatching in the data generated in the previous step,
which can identify near-optimal solutions while reducing search overhead. We
implement and evaluate LiteGD in both real and simulated GPU clusters with
homogeneous and heterogeneous interconnects, respectively. Experimental results
demonstrate that LiteGD consistently achieves high GPU bandwidth efficacy
(approximately 90\%) across various cluster configurations and 80\% in
real-world H100 cluster, significantly outperforming conventional default and
interconnect topology-aware dispatching methods, particularly in large-scale
heterogeneous environments.

TL;DR: This paper proposes 'Hermes,' a serving system for applications backed by LLMs. It introduces Probabilistic Demand Graphs (PDGraph) to optimize task scheduling and backend warming, achieving significantly improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing serving systems for LLM applications fail to optimize resource demands, leading to inefficiencies in queuing order and backend warmup latency.

Method: The paper models resource demands using Probabilistic Demand Graphs (PDGraph) and leverages the Gittins policy for optimal scheduling and prewarming backends at the right time.

Result: Hermes reduces average completion time by 70% and P95 completion time by 80% in experiments with diverse LLM applications.

Conclusion: Hermes demonstrates substantial improvements in serving efficiency for LLM applications by intelligently managing resource demands and backend readiness.

Abstract: Applications based on Large Language Models (LLMs) contains a series of tasks
to address real-world problems with boosted capability, which have dynamic
demand volumes on diverse backends. Existing serving systems treat the resource
demands of LLM applications as a blackbox, compromising end-to-end efficiency
due to improper queuing order and backend warm up latency. We find that the
resource demands of LLM applications can be modeled in a general and accurate
manner with Probabilistic Demand Graph (PDGraph). We then propose Hermes, which
leverages PDGraph for efficient serving of LLM applications. Confronting
probabilistic demand description, Hermes applies the Gittins policy to
determine the scheduling order that can minimize the average application
completion time. It also uses the PDGraph model to help prewarm cold backends
at proper moments. Experiments with diverse LLM applications confirm that
Hermes can effectively improve the application serving efficiency, reducing the
average completion time by over 70% and the P95 completion time by over 80%.

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'agentic plan caching,' a method for reusing plan templates in LLM-based agentic applications to cut costs while maintaining performance, especially in context-based workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high costs of LLM-based agentic applications, which require extensive planning and are not efficiently served by existing caching techniques.

Method: Proposing a caching system that extracts and reuses structured plan templates using keyword extraction and lightweight models for adaptation to semantically similar tasks.

Result: The new approach reduces costs by an average of 46.62% across multiple real-world applications without degrading performance.

Conclusion: Agentic plan caching is a cost-effective and practical enhancement to LLM serving infrastructures, particularly for applications relying heavily on planning and context adaptation.

Abstract: LLM-based agentic applications have shown increasingly remarkable
capabilities in complex workflows but incur substantial costs due to extensive
planning and reasoning requirements. Existing LLM caching techniques (like
context caching and semantic caching), primarily designed for serving chatbots,
are insufficient for agentic applications where outputs depend on external data
or environmental contexts. We propose agentic plan caching, a novel approach
that extracts, stores, adapts, and reuses structured plan templates from
planning stages of agentic applications across semantically similar tasks to
reduce the cost of serving. Unlike traditional semantic caching, our system
extracts plan templates from completed agent executions at test-time, employs
keyword extraction to match new requests against cached plans, and utilizes
lightweight models to adapt these templates to task-specific plans with
contexts. Evaluation across multiple real-world agentic applications shows that
our system can reduce costs by 46.62% on average while maintaining performance,
offering a more efficient solution for serving LLM-based agents that
complements existing LLM serving infrastructures.

### [143] [Integrating Dynamical Systems Learning with Foundational Models: A Meta-Evolutionary AI Framework for Clinical Trials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14782)
*Joseph Geraci,Bessi Qorri,Christian Cumbaa,Mike Tsay,Paul Leonczyk,Luca Pani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores two AI systems: DeepSeek-V3, a massive LLM, and NetraAI, a dynamical system-based platform for analyzing small clinical trial data. NetraAI identifies predictive patient subgroups using contraction mappings, evolutionary algorithms, and interpretable feature embeddings. The integration of these systems achieves remarkable classification performance in clinical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges of stability, interpretability, and small-data limitations in clinical AI models while leveraging the strengths of large-scale language models.

Method: The authors merge dynamical systems (NetraAI) and LLMs (DeepSeek-V3). NetraAI uses techniques like contraction mappings and evolutionary algorithms for feature analysis, while the LLM serves as a meta-evolutionary layer analyzing outputs and injecting domain insights. The combination enables self-improvement of AI systems.

Result: Case studies demonstrated that NetraAI identified highly predictive patient subgroups in schizophrenia, depression, and pancreatic cancer datasets. This improved weak baseline models into high-performing classifiers with minimal features.

Conclusion: NetraAI, combined with a large LLM strategist, showcases a novel approach to adaptive and explainable AI for clinical discovery, providing high accuracy and interpretable insights for small-data scenarios.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has evolved into an ecosystem of specialized
"species," each with unique strengths. We analyze two: DeepSeek-V3, a
671-billion-parameter Mixture of Experts large language model (LLM)
exemplifying scale-driven generality, and NetraAI, a dynamical system-based
framework engineered for stability and interpretability on small clinical trial
datasets. We formalize NetraAI's foundations, combining contraction mappings,
information geometry, and evolutionary algorithms to identify predictive
patient cohorts. Features are embedded in a metric space and iteratively
contracted toward stable attractors that define latent subgroups. A
pseudo-temporal embedding and long-range memory enable exploration of
higher-order feature interactions, while an internal evolutionary loop selects
compact, explainable 2-4-variable bundles ("Personas").
  To guide discovery, we introduce an LLM Strategist as a meta-evolutionary
layer that observes Persona outputs, prioritizes promising variables, injects
domain knowledge, and assesses robustness. This two-tier architecture mirrors
the human scientific process: NetraAI as experimentalist, the LLM as theorist,
forming a self-improving loop.
  In case studies (schizophrenia, depression, pancreatic cancer), NetraAI
uncovered small, high-effect-size subpopulations that transformed weak baseline
models (AUC ~0.50-0.68) into near-perfect classifiers using only a few
features. We position NetraAI at the intersection of dynamical systems,
information geometry, and evolutionary learning, aligned with emerging
concept-level reasoning paradigms such as LeCun's Joint Embedding Predictive
Architecture (JEPA). By prioritizing reliable, explainable knowledge, NetraAI
offers a new generation of adaptive, self-reflective AI to accelerate clinical
discovery.

### [144] [Flat Channels to Infinity in Neural Loss Landscapes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14951)
*Flavio Martinelli,Alexander Van Meegen,Berfin Şimşek,Wulfram Gerstner,Johanni Brea*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study uncovers channels in neural network loss landscapes where neuron weights diverge to infinity but converge to gated linear units, influencing optimization dynamics and computational outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to investigate peculiarities in neural network loss landscapes, specifically analyzing regions that appear as flat local minima but exhibit unique structural and behavioral features.

Method: The authors perform a geometrical and analytical examination of loss landscapes, focusing on channels where neuron weights diverge and derive how these pathways influence optimization algorithms.

Result: The study finds that neural networks often converge to channels where neuron weights diverge to +/- infinity, forming gated linear units, and these pathways are related to symmetry-induced critical points.

Conclusion: These findings reveal new insights about neural loss landscapes, showing hidden functional properties and raising implications for optimization techniques and the potential expressive power of neural architectures.

Abstract: The loss landscapes of neural networks contain minima and saddle points that
may be connected in flat regions or appear in isolation. We identify and
characterize a special structure in the loss landscape: channels along which
the loss decreases extremely slowly, while the output weights of at least two
neurons, $a_i$ and $a_j$, diverge to $\pm$infinity, and their input weight
vectors, $\mathbf{w_i}$ and $\mathbf{w_j}$, become equal to each other. At
convergence, the two neurons implement a gated linear unit:
$a_i\sigma(\mathbf{w_i} \cdot \mathbf{x}) + a_j\sigma(\mathbf{w_j} \cdot
\mathbf{x}) \rightarrow \sigma(\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x}) + (\mathbf{v} \cdot
\mathbf{x}) \sigma'(\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x})$. Geometrically, these
channels to infinity are asymptotically parallel to symmetry-induced lines of
critical points. Gradient flow solvers, and related optimization methods like
SGD or ADAM, reach the channels with high probability in diverse regression
settings, but without careful inspection they look like flat local minima with
finite parameter values. Our characterization provides a comprehensive picture
of these quasi-flat regions in terms of gradient dynamics, geometry, and
functional interpretation. The emergence of gated linear units at the end of
the channels highlights a surprising aspect of the computational capabilities
of fully connected layers.

*Mohamed Masry,Mohamed Amen,Mohamed Elzyat,Mohamed Hamed,Norhan Magdy,Maram Khaled*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ETS, a framework using EEG and eye-tracking data to improve open-vocabulary text generation and sentiment classification, achieving better BLEU, Rouge, and F1 scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in decoding natural language from EEG data using non-invasive techniques, especially for open-vocabulary scenarios where traditional methods underperform.

Method: The ETS framework integrates EEG with synchronized eye-tracking data, aiming to enhance text decoding and sentiment classification tasks.

Result: Superior performance in BLEU, Rouge scores for text decoding and up to 10% improvement in F1 score for sentiment classification compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed ETS model demonstrates strong potential for developing high-performance EEG-to-text systems applicable across various subjects and data sources.

Abstract: Decoding natural language from brain activity using non-invasive
electroencephalography (EEG) remains a significant challenge in neuroscience
and machine learning, particularly for open-vocabulary scenarios where
traditional methods struggle with noise and variability. Previous studies have
achieved high accuracy on small-closed vocabularies, but it still struggles on
open vocabularies. In this study, we propose ETS, a framework that integrates
EEG with synchronized eye-tracking data to address two critical tasks: (1)
open-vocabulary text generation and (2) sentiment classification of perceived
language. Our model achieves a superior performance on BLEU and Rouge score for
EEG-To-Text decoding and up to 10% F1 score on EEG-based ternary sentiment
classification, which significantly outperforms supervised baselines.
Furthermore, we show that our proposed model can handle data from various
subjects and sources, showing great potential for high performance open
vocabulary eeg-to-text system.

*Ethan Mulle,Wei Kang,Qi Gong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework named HiPreNets for training highly accurate neural networks by minimizing both MSE and $L^{\infty}$ errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training deep neural networks becomes increasingly challenging for complex problems due to non-convex optimization, hyperparameter tuning, and often an overemphasis on MSE rather than $L^{\infty}$ error.

Method: The method refines staged training by sequentially learning prediction residuals using additional neural networks, optimizing loss functions, parameter choices, and adaptive data sampling techniques.

Result: The approach demonstrates improved accuracy and validity through benchmark problems.

Conclusion: HiPreNets offer a systematic strategy for improving neural network precision, addressing both MSE and $L^{\infty}$ error considerations.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are powerful tools for solving nonlinear problems in
science and engineering, but training highly accurate models becomes
challenging as problem complexity increases. Non-convex optimization and
numerous hyperparameters to tune make performance improvement difficult, and
traditional approaches often prioritize minimizing mean squared error (MSE)
while overlooking $L^{\infty}$ error, which is the critical focus in many
applications. To address these challenges, we present a progressive framework
for training and tuning high-precision neural networks (HiPreNets). Our
approach refines a previously explored staged training technique for neural
networks that improves an existing fully connected neural network by
sequentially learning its prediction residuals using additional networks,
leading to improved overall accuracy. We discuss how to take advantage of the
structure of the residuals to guide the choice of loss function, number of
parameters to use, and ways to introduce adaptive data sampling techniques. We
validate our framework's effectiveness through several benchmark problems.

### [147] [Predicting Onflow Parameters Using Transfer Learning for Domain and Task Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14784)
*Emre Yilmaz,Philipp Bekemeyer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Research presents a transfer learning approach using ConvNets to predict onflow parameters (angle of attack and speed) based on surface pressure data, addressing issues in traditional prediction methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate and adaptive prediction of onflow parameters (angle of attack, speed) for wind tunnel operations and aerospace/wind turbine applications, particularly to mitigate sensor fault challenges and real-time requirements.

Method: Developed a ConvNet-based transfer learning methodology where initial training occurs offline. Weights are frozen except output-adjacent layers, which are retrained for domain/task adaptation.

Result: Successful adaptation to changing data distributions, target domains, and new tasks demonstrated; limited effectiveness for noisy data and exploration provided on extended domains and sampling variations.

Conclusion: Proposed approach shows promise for domain/task adaptation in real-world aerodynamic applications, though noisy data remains a challenge to address.

Abstract: Determining onflow parameters is crucial from the perspectives of wind tunnel
testing and regular flight and wind turbine operations. These parameters have
traditionally been predicted via direct measurements which might lead to
challenges in case of sensor faults. Alternatively, a data-driven prediction
model based on surface pressure data can be used to determine these parameters.
It is essential that such predictors achieve close to real-time learning as
dictated by practical applications such as monitoring wind tunnel operations or
learning the variations in aerodynamic performance of aerospace and wind energy
systems. To overcome the challenges caused by changes in the data distribution
as well as in adapting to a new prediction task, we propose a transfer learning
methodology to predict the onflow parameters, specifically angle of attack and
onflow speed. It requires first training a convolutional neural network
(ConvNet) model offline for the core prediction task, then freezing the weights
of this model except the selected layers preceding the output node, and finally
executing transfer learning by retraining these layers. A demonstration of this
approach is provided using steady CFD analysis data for an airfoil for i)
domain adaptation where transfer learning is performed with data from a target
domain having different data distribution than the source domain and ii) task
adaptation where the prediction task is changed. Further exploration on the
influence of noisy data, performance on an extended domain, and trade studies
varying sampling sizes and architectures are provided. Results successfully
demonstrate the potential of the approach for adaptation to changing data
distribution, domain extension, and task update while the application for noisy
data is concluded to be not as effective.

### [148] [PIPE: Physics-Informed Position Encoding for Alignment of Satellite Images and Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14786)
*Haobo Li,Eunseo Jung,Zixin Chen,Zhaowei Wang,Yueya Wang,Huamin Qu,Alexis Kai Hon Lau*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces PIPE, a lightweight method that embeds physical information into vision language models for multimodal time series forecasting involving visual and numerical data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Currently, multimodal forecasting methods neglect visual data such as satellite imagery, which carries essential physical information like geospatial and temporal context. This limits forecasting models' effectiveness.

Method: PIPE combines physics-informed positional indexing and variant-frequency positional encoding to integrate physical and sequential information into vision language models for better multimodal alignment.

Result: The PIPE method achieved state-of-the-art performance, significantly improving accuracy in multimodal forecasting tasks, including a 12% enhancement in typhoon intensity forecasting compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: By embedding physical and sequential order information, PIPE bridges the gap in multimodal forecasting, offering a robust and accurate approach for leveraging visual data such as satellite imagery in climate science predictions.

Abstract: Multimodal time series forecasting is foundational in various fields, such as
utilizing satellite imagery and numerical data for predicting typhoons in
climate science. However, existing multimodal approaches primarily focus on
utilizing text data to help time series forecasting, leaving the visual data in
existing time series datasets untouched. Furthermore, it is challenging for
models to effectively capture the physical information embedded in visual data,
such as satellite imagery's temporal and geospatial context, which extends
beyond images themselves. To address this gap, we propose physics-informed
positional encoding (PIPE), a lightweight method that embeds physical
information into vision language models (VLMs). PIPE introduces two key
innovations: (1) a physics-informed positional indexing scheme for mapping
physics to positional IDs, and (2) a variant-frequency positional encoding
mechanism for encoding frequency information of physical variables and
sequential order of tokens within the embedding space. By preserving both the
physical information and sequential order information, PIPE significantly
improves multimodal alignment and forecasting accuracy. Through the experiments
on the most representative and the largest open-sourced satellite image
dataset, PIPE achieves state-of-the-art performance in both deep learning
forecasting and climate domain methods, demonstrating superiority across
benchmarks, including a 12% improvement in typhoon intensity forecasting over
prior works. Our code is provided in the supplementary material.

Motivation: To address limitations of existing methods in exploring multimodal distributions effectively.

Method: Developed BSVGD, a variation of SVGD enhanced with a random branching process to promote better exploration of the state space.

Result: Theoretical convergence guarantees were provided, with numerical experiments validating the algorithm's performance. Comparisons were made between BSVGD and SVGD using Wasserstein distance and computational time metrics.

Conclusion: BSVGD offers an improved approach over SVGD for handling multimodal distributions, with validated performance and theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: We propose a novel particle-based variational inference method designed to
work with multimodal distributions. Our approach, referred to as Branched Stein
Variational Gradient Descent (BSVGD), extends the classical Stein Variational
Gradient Descent (SVGD) algorithm by incorporating a random branching mechanism
that encourages the exploration of the state space. In this work, a theoretical
guarantee for the convergence in distribution is presented, as well as
numerical experiments to validate the suitability of our algorithm. Performance
comparisons between the BSVGD and the SVGD are presented using the Wasserstein
distance between samples and the corresponding computational times.

*Funing Li,Yuan Tian,Ruben Noortwyck,Jifeng Zhou,Liming Kuang,Robert Schulz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper tackles the retrieval challenges in multi-deep storage systems using deep reinforcement learning, focusing on minimizing total tardiness for heterogeneous items.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies and lane blockages in retrieving items in multi-deep autonomous vehicle storage and retrieval systems while maximizing flexibility and adaptability.

Method: The authors propose a deep reinforcement learning framework utilizing a graph-based state representation combined with a Graph Neural Network and Transformer architecture.

Result: Extensive experiments show the framework's superiority over heuristic methods and its effectiveness in minimizing retrieval tardiness across diverse warehouse configurations.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of integrating advanced machine learning models to optimize complex logistics operations, enhancing the performance and adaptability of storage systems.

Abstract: In modern industrial and logistics environments, the rapid expansion of fast
delivery services has heightened the demand for storage systems that combine
high efficiency with increased density. Multi-deep autonomous vehicle storage
and retrieval systems (AVS/RS) present a viable solution for achieving greater
storage density. However, these systems encounter significant challenges during
retrieval operations due to lane blockages. A conventional approach to mitigate
this issue involves storing items with homogeneous characteristics in a single
lane, but this strategy restricts the flexibility and adaptability of
multi-deep storage systems.
  In this study, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based framework to
address the retrieval problem in multi-deep storage systems with heterogeneous
item configurations. Each item is associated with a specific due date, and the
objective is to minimize total tardiness. To effectively capture the system's
topology, we introduce a graph-based state representation that integrates both
item attributes and the local topological structure of the multi-deep
warehouse. To process this representation, we design a novel neural network
architecture that combines a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with a Transformer
model. The GNN encodes topological and item-specific information into
embeddings for all directly accessible items, while the Transformer maps these
embeddings into global priority assignments. The Transformer's strong
generalization capability further allows our approach to be applied to storage
systems with diverse layouts. Extensive numerical experiments, including
comparisons with heuristic methods, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
neural network architecture and the effectiveness of the trained agent in
optimizing retrieval tardiness.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a hybrid BiGRU-MHA model for SSD health state prediction with high accuracy and generalization, aimed at improving data reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional SSD health prediction models struggle with generalization and fail to effectively capture critical temporal and key feature dependencies. The study aims to address these issues for better reliability.

Method: The hybrid BiGRU-MHA model combines bidirectional GRU networks for temporal feature extraction with a multi-head attention mechanism to dynamically focus on key health indicators.

Result: The model achieves a classification accuracy of 92.44% on the test set, with an AUC of 0.94, showing robust binary classification and minimal performance gap, indicative of excellent generalization.

Conclusion: This model offers a practical approach for improving SSD reliability by reducing data loss risks and optimizing maintenance costs for cloud and edge storage environments.

Abstract: Aiming at the critical role of SSD health state prediction in data
reliability assurance, this study proposes a hybrid BiGRU-MHA model that
incorporates a multi-head attention mechanism to enhance the accuracy and
stability of storage device health classification. The model innovatively
integrates temporal feature extraction and key information focusing
capabilities. Specifically, it leverages the bidirectional timing modeling
advantages of the BiGRU network to capture both forward and backward
dependencies of SSD degradation features. Simultaneously, the multi-head
attention mechanism dynamically assigns feature weights, improving the model's
sensitivity to critical health indicators. Experimental results show that the
proposed model achieves classification accuracies of 92.70% on the training set
and 92.44% on the test set, with a minimal performance gap of only 0.26%,
demonstrating excellent generalization ability. Further analysis using the
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve shows an area under the curve
(AUC) of 0.94 on the test set, confirming the model's robust binary
classification performance. This work not only presents a new technical
approach for SSD health prediction but also addresses the generalization
bottleneck of traditional models, offering a verifiable method with practical
value for preventive maintenance of industrial-grade storage systems. The
results show the model can significantly reduce data loss risks by providing
early failure warnings and help optimize maintenance costs, supporting
intelligent decision-making in building reliable storage systems for cloud
computing data centers and edge storage environments.

Conclusion: AZT1D enhances opportunities for advancing clinical decision-making and personalized care in T1D through rich and detailed real-world data.

Abstract: High quality real world datasets are essential for advancing data driven
approaches in type 1 diabetes (T1D) management, including personalized therapy
design, digital twin systems, and glucose prediction models. However, progress
in this area has been limited by the scarcity of publicly available datasets
that offer detailed and comprehensive patient data. To address this gap, we
present AZT1D, a dataset containing data collected from 25 individuals with T1D
on automated insulin delivery (AID) systems. AZT1D includes continuous glucose
monitoring (CGM) data, insulin pump and insulin administration data,
carbohydrate intake, and device mode (regular, sleep, and exercise) obtained
over 6 to 8 weeks for each patient. Notably, the dataset provides granular
details on bolus insulin delivery (i.e., total dose, bolus type, correction
specific amounts) features that are rarely found in existing datasets. By
offering rich, naturalistic data, AZT1D supports a wide range of artificial
intelligence and machine learning applications aimed at improving clinical
decision making and individualized care in T1D.

### [153] [Two-dimensional Parallel Tempering for Constrained Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14781)
*Corentin Delacour,M Mahmudul Hasan Sajeeb,Joao P. Hespanha,Kerem Y. Camsari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a two-dimensional variation of parallel tempering to improve sampling in heavily constrained optimization problems represented by Ising models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of balancing constraint enforcement and sampling efficiency in hardware accelerators for Ising models.

Method: Developed a two-dimensional parallel tempering algorithm (2D-PT) with strength penalty interpolation in an added dimension of replicas.

Result: Achieved significant mixing improvement and accelerated performance compared to traditional methods in constrained optimization tasks.

Conclusion: 2D-PT enhances sampling efficiency, avoids manual tuning of penalty strengths, and is adaptable to existing Ising machines.

Abstract: Sampling Boltzmann probability distributions plays a key role in machine
learning and optimization, motivating the design of hardware accelerators such
as Ising machines. While the Ising model can in principle encode arbitrary
optimization problems, practical implementations are often hindered by soft
constraints that either slow down mixing when too strong, or fail to enforce
feasibility when too weak. We introduce a two-dimensional extension of the
powerful parallel tempering algorithm (PT) that addresses this challenge by
adding a second dimension of replicas interpolating the penalty strengths. This
scheme ensures constraint satisfaction in the final replicas, analogous to
low-energy states at low temperature. The resulting two-dimensional parallel
tempering algorithm (2D-PT) improves mixing in heavily constrained replicas and
eliminates the need to explicitly tune the penalty strength. In a
representative example of graph sparsification with copy constraints, 2D-PT
achieves near-ideal mixing, with Kullback-Leibler divergence decaying as
O(1/t). When applied to sparsified Wishart instances, 2D-PT yields orders of
magnitude speedup over conventional PT with the same number of replicas. The
method applies broadly to constrained Ising problems and can be deployed on
existing Ising machines.

### [154] [Continuous Evolution Pool: Taming Recurring Concept Drift in Online Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14790)
*Tianxiang Zhan,Ming Jin,Yuanpeng He,Yuxuan Liang,Yong Deng,Shirui Pan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Continuous Evolution Pool (CEP), a mechanism for retaining and utilizing knowledge in recurring concept drift scenarios. Experiments showed improved forecasting accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recurring concept drift reduces the accuracy of online predictions as previously learned knowledge is forgotten, and existing solutions fail to adequately retain and reuse old knowledge.

Method: The proposed CEP pools forecasters for different concepts, selects the nearest forecaster based on test samples, and updates or evolves models when new concepts emerge, paired with an elimination mechanism for outdated knowledge.

Result: Experiments across eight real datasets and different models confirmed that CEP enhances predictions by effectively retaining knowledge and addressing recurring concept drifts.

Conclusion: CEP provides a novel approach to knowledge retention and retrieval, significantly improving prediction performance in recurring concept drift scenarios.

Abstract: Recurring concept drift, a type of concept drift in which previously observed
data patterns reappear after some time, is one of the most prevalent types of
concept drift in time series. As time progresses, concept drift occurs and
previously encountered concepts are forgotten, thereby leading to a decline in
the accuracy of online predictions. Existing solutions employ parameter
updating techniques to delay forgetting; however, this may result in the loss
of some previously learned knowledge while neglecting the exploration of
knowledge retention mechanisms. To retain all conceptual knowledge and fully
utilize it when the concepts recur, we propose the Continuous Evolution Pool
(CEP), a pooling mechanism that stores different instances of forecasters for
different concepts. Our method first selects the forecaster nearest to the test
sample and then learns the features from its neighboring samples - a process we
refer to as the retrieval. If there are insufficient neighboring samples, it
indicates that a new concept has emerged, and a new model will evolve from the
current nearest sample to the pool to store the knowledge of the concept.
Simultaneously, the elimination mechanism will enable outdated knowledge to be
cleared to ensure the prediction effect of the forecasters. Experiments on
different architectural models and eight real datasets demonstrate that CEP
effectively retains the knowledge of different concepts. In the scenario of
online forecasting with recurring concepts, CEP significantly enhances the
prediction results.

*Aditya Ravuri,Neil D. Lawrence*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study enhances the zero-shot performance of Protein Language Models (PLMs) for predicting protein fitness by injecting dropout at inference and applying Monte-Carlo averaging, without retraining the models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the predictive capabilities of PLMs in zero-shot scenarios for critical protein properties, addressing inherent limitations.

Method: Dropout layers were added between the embedding/featurizer and transformer layers during inference without retraining. Monte-Carlo dropout averaging was used to refine predictions.

Result: Using a dropout rate of 0.1, their method improved zero-shot performance for protein property predictions on subsets of the ProteinGym dataset.

Conclusion: Dropout injection during inference enhances the zero-shot predictive ability of PLMs like ESM2, providing a straightforward performance boost without requiring model retraining.

Abstract: Protein Language Models (PLMs) such as ESM2 have been shown to be capable of
zero-shot prediction of critical scalar properties of proteins (fitness). In
this work, we show that injecting a dropout layer at inference time between a
PLM's featurizer/embedding layer and its transformer, and averaging its output
akin to Monte-Carlo dropout increases zero-shot performance on a subset of the
ProteinGym dataset. This is the case even when the model was not trained with
dropouts to begin with, and does not require retraining or finetuning of the
PLM. A dropout of 0.1 seems performant across all models.

*Henrik Klagges,Robert Dahlke,Fabian Klemm,Benjamin Merkel,Daniel Klingmann,David A. Reiss,Dan Zecha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the "Assembly-of-Experts" (AoE) method to efficiently create child models from existing Mixture-of-Experts models, combining features while maintaining function and achieving optimization without additional fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pretraining of large language models (LLMs) is highly expensive in computation and inefficient, prompting the need for methods that can leverage existing trained models more effectively.

Method: AoE constructs child models from parent Mixture-of-Experts models by interpolating weight tensors individually, allowing for controlled adjustment of semantic features while maintaining functionality.

Result: Using the AoE method, they created the DeepSeek R1T "Chimera," a 671B hybrid model performing near R1-level intelligence and enhanced efficiency, achieving 40% fewer output tokens and comparable speed to V3.

Conclusion: The AoE interpolation method provides a linear, practical approach to model construction, enabling functional, efficient hybrid models without further training, revealing insights into gradual and sharp transitions in model characteristics.

Abstract: Requiring $10^{13}$-$10^{15}$ FLOPs to calculate one 8 bit weight in an LLM
during pretraining is extremely expensive and seems inefficient. To better
leverage the huge investments made into pretrained models, we develop the new
"Assembly-of-Experts" (AoE) construction method to create capable child
variants of existing Mixture-of-Experts parent models in linear time. Model
weight tensors get interpolated individually, allowing to enhance or suppress
semantic features of the parents.
  Varying the proportion of weights taken from the parent models, we observe
some properties of the AoE child model changing gradually, while other
behavioral traits emerge with a sharp transition. Surprisingly, nearly every
generated model is functional and capable, which makes searching the model
space straightforward.
  We construct the DeepSeek R1T "Chimera", a 671B open-weights hybrid model
combining DeepSeek's V3-0324 and R1 model variants. The child inherits only the
routed expert tensors of R1, but still achieves about R1-level intelligence. At
the same time, it uses about 40\% fewer output tokens, close to V3 speed.
Constructed without any fine-tuning or distillation, the Chimera exhibits
surprisingly compact, orderly reasoning compared to its parent models.

### [157] [Optimal Embedding Learning Rate in LLMs: The Effect of Vocabulary Size](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15025)
*Soufiane Hayou,Liyuan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper examines the limitations of the Maximal Update Parametrization ($\mu P$) approach for large language models (LLMs) and introduces a new theoretical regime for scaling rules in scenarios with large vocabulary sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the efficiency of pretraining large language models, particularly by addressing the limitations of $
$P theory when vocabulary size is much larger than model width, which is often the case in LLMs.

Method: The paper theoretically analyzes the effects of large vocabulary sizes on training dynamics, introducing a new regime (Large Vocab, LV) with different optimal scaling rules for learning rates. It then validates the theoretical findings with experiments, including pretraining a 1B parameter model from scratch.

Result: The study shows that in the LV regime, the optimal learning rate scaling rule differs significantly from those predicted by $
$P, with the embedding LR to hidden LR ratio scaling as $\Theta(\sqrt{width})$. These findings align well with prior empirical observations.

Conclusion: The theoretical and experimental results demonstrate the benefit of a new scaling rule for the embedding learning rate in large vocabulary scenarios, offering improvements over $
$P and providing practical guidance for more efficient LLM training.

Abstract: Pretraining large language models is a costly process. To make this process
more efficient, several methods have been proposed to optimize model
architecture/parametrization and hardware use. On the parametrization side,
$\mu P$ (Maximal Update Parametrization) parametrizes model weights and
learning rate (LR) in a way that makes hyperparameters (HPs) transferable with
width (embedding dimension): HPs can be tuned for a small model and used for
larger models without additional tuning. While $\mu$P showed impressive results
in practice, recent empirical studies have reported conflicting observations
when applied to LLMs. One limitation of the theory behind $\mu$P is the fact
that input dimension (vocabulary size in LLMs) is considered fixed when taking
the width to infinity. This is unrealistic since vocabulary size is generally
much larger than width in practice. In this work, we provide a theoretical
analysis of the effect of vocabulary size on training dynamics, and
subsequently show that as vocabulary size increases, the training dynamics
\emph{interpolate between the $\mu$P regime and another regime that we call
Large Vocab (LV) Regime}, where optimal scaling rules are different from those
predicted by $\mu$P. Our analysis reveals that in the LV regime, the optimal
embedding LR to hidden LR ratio should roughly scale as $\Theta(\sqrt{width})$,
surprisingly close to the empirical findings previously reported in the
literature, and different from the $\Theta(width)$ ratio predicted by $\mu$P.
We conduct several experiments to validate our theory, and pretrain a 1B model
from scratch to show the benefit of our suggested scaling rule for the
embedding LR.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study derives fundamental limits on the trade-off between generalization and selective identification in intelligent systems through theoretical modeling and empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how intelligent systems balance generalization and input-specificity using their representational capacity.

Method: Theoretical derivation of generalization and identification probabilities, Pareto front analysis, and empirical validation through minimal and complex neural networks.

Result: A universal Pareto front characterizes the trade-off between generalization and identification, and finite-resolution similarity imposes a fundamental constraint.

Conclusion: Finite-resolution similarity underpins the trade-off in representational capacity, shaping both artificial and biological systems' processing abilities.

Abstract: Intelligent systems must deploy internal representations that are
simultaneously structured -- to support broad generalization -- and selective
-- to preserve input identity. We expose a fundamental limit on this tradeoff.
For any model whose representational similarity between inputs decays with
finite semantic resolution $\varepsilon$, we derive closed-form expressions
that pin its probability of correct generalization $p_S$ and identification
$p_I$ to a universal Pareto front independent of input space geometry.
Extending the analysis to noisy, heterogeneous spaces and to $n>2$ inputs
predicts a sharp $1/n$ collapse of multi-input processing capacity and a
non-monotonic optimum for $p_S$. A minimal ReLU network trained end-to-end
reproduces these laws: during learning a resolution boundary self-organizes and
empirical $(p_S,p_I)$ trajectories closely follow theoretical curves for
linearly decaying similarity. Finally, we demonstrate that the same limits
persist in two markedly more complex settings -- a convolutional neural network
and state-of-the-art vision-language models -- confirming that
finite-resolution similarity is a fundamental emergent informational
constraint, not merely a toy-model artifact. Together, these results provide an
exact theory of the generalization-identification trade-off and clarify how
semantic resolution shapes the representational capacity of deep networks and
brains alike.

### [159] [Event-Driven Online Vertical Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14911)
*Ganyu Wang,Boyu Wang,Bin Gu,Charles Ling*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents an event-driven online Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) framework to handle asynchronous, non-stationary data scenarios while reducing computational and communication costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from addressing the limitations of existing online VFL methods, which fail to handle asynchronous data generated by disjoint events in real-world scenarios.

Method: The authors propose an event-driven online VFL framework where only a subset of clients is activated per event while others passively collaborate. They also incorporate dynamic local regret analysis to handle non-convex models in non-stationary environments.

Result: The framework proved to be more stable under non-stationary data conditions compared to existing methods, while also lowering communication and computation burdens.

Conclusion: The proposed event-driven online VFL framework effectively addresses non-stationary data challenges in online learning, providing stability and efficiency advantages over traditional approaches.

Abstract: Online learning is more adaptable to real-world scenarios in Vertical
Federated Learning (VFL) compared to offline learning. However, integrating
online learning into VFL presents challenges due to the unique nature of VFL,
where clients possess non-intersecting feature sets for the same sample. In
real-world scenarios, the clients may not receive data streaming for the
disjoint features for the same entity synchronously. Instead, the data are
typically generated by an \emph{event} relevant to only a subset of clients. We
are the first to identify these challenges in online VFL, which have been
overlooked by previous research. To address these challenges, we proposed an
event-driven online VFL framework. In this framework, only a subset of clients
were activated during each event, while the remaining clients passively
collaborated in the learning process. Furthermore, we incorporated
\emph{dynamic local regret (DLR)} into VFL to address the challenges posed by
online learning problems with non-convex models within a non-stationary
environment. We conducted a comprehensive regret analysis of our proposed
framework, specifically examining the DLR under non-convex conditions with
event-driven online VFL. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our proposed
framework was more stable than the existing online VFL framework under
non-stationary data conditions while also significantly reducing communication
and computation costs.

### [160] [Muon Optimizes Under Spectral Norm Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15054)
*Lizhang Chen,Jonathan Li,Qiang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides a theoretical analysis of the Muon optimizer by linking it to Lion-𝕂, demonstrating its implicit regularization effects and introducing generalizations for constrained optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Muon optimizer showed promising practical performance, but its theoretical basis was insufficiently understood. This paper aims to address this gap to enhance understanding and enable broader applications.

Method: The paper analyzes Muon through its connection with the Lion-𝕂 optimizer, using theoretical tools to establish an implicit link to spectral norm constraints and exploring its generalizations via alternative convex maps.

Result: Muon is shown to be part of the Lion-𝕂 family through its application of nuclear norm and implicitly solves optimization problems enforcing spectral norm constraints on weight matrices.

Conclusion: The analysis of Muon enhances its theoretical understanding, demystifies its regularization effects, and opens pathways to generalized optimization algorithms with varied implicit constraints.

Abstract: The pursuit of faster optimization algorithms remains an active and important
research direction in deep learning. Recently, the Muon optimizer [JJB+24] has
demonstrated promising empirical performance, but its theoretical foundation
remains less understood. In this paper, we bridge this gap and provide a
theoretical analysis of Muon by placing it within the Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ family
of optimizers [CLLL24]. Specifically, we show that Muon corresponds to
Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ when equipped with the nuclear norm, and we leverage the
theoretical results of Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ to establish that Muon (with
decoupled weight decay) implicitly solves an optimization problem that enforces
a constraint on the spectral norm of weight matrices. This perspective not only
demystifies the implicit regularization effects of Muon but also leads to
natural generalizations through varying the choice of convex map $\mathcal{K}$,
allowing for the exploration of a broader class of implicitly regularized and
constrained optimization algorithms.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ss-Mamba, a foundational model for time series forecasting that combines semantic embeddings, adaptive spline-based encoding, and selective state-space modeling for efficient computation and robust prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational complexity in Transformer architectures while improving accuracy, robustness, and interpretability in time-series forecasting.

Method: The model integrates semantic-aware embeddings from pretrained language models, adaptive spline-based encoding using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN), and the selective state-space modeling framework for efficient computation.

Result: ss-Mamba achieves superior forecasting accuracy, robustness, and interpretability compared to traditional approaches, while reducing computational complexity from quadratic to linear time.

Conclusion: ss-Mamba serves as a versatile and computationally efficient alternative to Transformer-based time-series forecasting models, leveraging advanced semantic and temporal encoding techniques.

Abstract: We propose ss-Mamba, a novel foundation model that enhances time series
forecasting by integrating semantic-aware embeddings and adaptive spline-based
temporal encoding within a selective state-space modeling framework. Building
upon the recent success of Transformer architectures, ss-Mamba adopts the Mamba
selective state space model as an efficient alternative that achieves
comparable performance while significantly reducing computational complexity
from quadratic to linear time. Semantic index embeddings, initialized from
pretrained language models, allow effective generalization to previously unseen
series through meaningful semantic priors. Additionally, spline-based
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) dynamically and interpretably capture complex
seasonalities and non-stationary temporal effects, providing a powerful
enhancement over conventional temporal feature encodings. Extensive
experimental evaluations confirm that ss-Mamba delivers superior accuracy,
robustness, and interpretability, demonstrating its capability as a versatile
and computationally efficient alternative to traditional Transformer-based
models in time-series forecasting.

### [162] [Neural Canonical Polyadic Factorization for Traffic Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15079)
*Yikai Hou,Peng Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Neural Canonical Polyadic Factorization (NCPF), combining tensor algebra and deep learning to tackle the challenge of missing traffic data in urban transportation systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sensor failures and gaps in traffic data collection cause pervasive missing data, hindering accurate spatiotemporal traffic analysis for intelligent transportation systems.

Method: The paper devised NCPF, embedding low-rank tensor decomposition into neural networks using learnable projections and hierarchically fusing features with Hadamard products, alongside multilayer perceptrons for nonlinear refinement.

Result: Through evaluations on six urban traffic datasets, NCPF outperforms six state-of-the-art methods in traffic data imputation, demonstrating superior spatiotemporal representation and analysis.

Conclusion: NCPF effectively combines interpretable tensor factor analysis and neural network capabilities, providing a robust framework for traffic data imputation and advancing adaptive traffic systems and transportation digital twins.

Abstract: Modern intelligent transportation systems rely on accurate spatiotemporal
traffic analysis to optimize urban mobility and infrastructure resilience.
However, pervasive missing data caused by sensor failures and heterogeneous
sensing gaps fundamentally hinders reliable traffic modeling. This paper
proposes a Neural Canonical Polyadic Factorization (NCPF) model that synergizes
low-rank tensor algebra with deep representation learning for robust traffic
data imputation. The model innovatively embeds CP decomposition into neural
architecture through learnable embedding projections, where sparse traffic
tensors are encoded into dense latent factors across road segments, time
intervals, and mobility metrics. A hierarchical feature fusion mechanism
employs Hadamard products to explicitly model multilinear interactions, while
stacked multilayer perceptron layers nonlinearly refine these representations
to capture complex spatiotemporal couplings. Extensive evaluations on six urban
traffic datasets demonstrate NCPF's superiority over six state-of-the-art
baselines. By unifying CP decomposition's interpretable factor analysis with
neural network's nonlinear expressive power, NCPF provides a principled yet
flexible approaches for high-dimensional traffic data imputation, offering
critical support for next-generation transportation digital twins and adaptive
traffic control systems.

*Bochen Lyu,Xiaojing Zhang,Fangyi Zheng,He Wang,Zheng Wang,Zhanxing Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a refined continuous time model for the Heavy-Ball momentum method, incorporating explicit discretization error control to enhance theoretical analysis and strengthen its application to optimization methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between discrete optimization methods and their continuous time approximations by addressing unresolved issues related to discretization error.

Method: The authors design a piece-wise continuous differential equation for the Heavy-Ball momentum method, explicitly incorporating counter terms to control discretization error up to arbitrary orders of step size.

Result: The paper provides a continuous time model for the Heavy-Ball momentum method, enabling improved control over discretization error, and explores its implicit regularization effects and bias in deep learning applications, with supporting numerical experiments.

Conclusion: This work offers tools to better analyze and understand the Heavy-Ball momentum method, showing its potential in optimization and deep learning tasks by explicitly accounting for discretization errors.

Abstract: This paper establishes a continuous time approximation, a piece-wise
continuous differential equation, for the discrete Heavy-Ball (HB) momentum
method with explicit discretization error. Investigating continuous
differential equations has been a promising approach for studying the discrete
optimization methods. Despite the crucial role of momentum in gradient-based
optimization methods, the gap between the original discrete dynamics and the
continuous time approximations due to the discretization error has not been
comprehensively bridged yet. In this work, we study the HB momentum method in
continuous time while putting more focus on the discretization error to provide
additional theoretical tools to this area. In particular, we design a
first-order piece-wise continuous differential equation, where we add a number
of counter terms to account for the discretization error explicitly. As a
result, we provide a continuous time model for the HB momentum method that
allows the control of discretization error to arbitrary order of the step size.
As an application, we leverage it to find a new implicit regularization of the
directional smoothness and investigate the implicit bias of HB for diagonal
linear networks, indicating how our results can be used in deep learning. Our
theoretical findings are further supported by numerical experiments.

*Mélanie Cambus,Darya Melnyk,Tijana Milentijević,Stefan Schmid*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates robustness in federated learning against Byzantine faults, introducing theoretical bounds on centroid approximation and proposing a new algorithm achieving optimal results under specific conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine the robustness of federated learning in distributed settings, particularly against Byzantine behaviors and explore the tradeoff between validity conditions and accurate model averaging.

Method: The authors establish theoretical bounds for centroid approximation under specific validity conditions and propose a new algorithm for convex validity. Analytical results are supplemented with empirical evaluations.

Result: They provide lower and upper bounds for centroid approximation related to Byzantine faults, introduce an algorithm with optimal approximation, and validate their findings in federated SGD and averaging settings.

Conclusion: The bounds and algorithm presented advance the understanding of robustness in federated learning, bridging theoretical insights with practical applications.

Abstract: Federated learning allows each client to keep its data locally when training
machine learning models in a distributed setting. Significant recent research
established the requirements that the input must satisfy in order to guarantee
convergence of the training loop. This line of work uses averaging as the
aggregation rule for the training models. In particular, we are interested in
whether federated learning is robust to Byzantine behavior, and observe and
investigate a tradeoff between the average/centroid and the validity conditions
from distributed computing. We show that the various validity conditions alone
do not guarantee a good approximation of the average. Furthermore, we show that
reaching good approximation does not give good results in experimental settings
due to possible Byzantine outliers. Our main contribution is the first lower
bound of $\min\{\frac{n-t}{t},\sqrt{d}\}$ on the centroid approximation under
box validity that is often considered in the literature, where $n$ is the
number of clients, $t$ the upper bound on the number of Byzantine faults, and
$d$ is the dimension of the machine learning model. We complement this lower
bound by an upper bound of $2\min\{n,\sqrt{d}\}$, by providing a new analysis
for the case $n<d$. In addition, we present a new algorithm that achieves a
$\sqrt{2d}$-approximation under convex validity, which also proves that the
existing lower bound in the literature is tight. We show that all presented
bounds can also be achieved in the distributed peer-to-peer setting. We
complement our analytical results with empirical evaluations in federated
stochastic gradient descent and federated averaging settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper examines the accuracy and generalization of machine learning models on the 1D Poisson differential equation, deriving theoretical and empirical insights and proposing a new evaluation benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the critical need for quantitative accuracy in scientific applications of machine learning and to assess the generalization limits of existing models for differential equations.

Method: The authors analyze training dynamics and derive theoretical generalization bounds for different machine learning models. Empirical tests are performed for various models, such as white-box methods, deep neural networks, and DeepONets, focused on the 1D Poisson equation.

Result: The study identifies that data function space significantly impacts generalization, shows limitations in current models to generalize to true physical equations, and finds that Green's function representations can offer mechanistic interpretability.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the lack of guaranteed model generalization in scientific problems and propose a new validation technique using the Poisson equation as a benchmark for future methods.

Abstract: While there are many applications of ML to scientific problems that look
promising, visuals can be deceiving. For scientific applications, actual
quantitative accuracy is crucial. This work applies the rigor of numerical
analysis for differential equations to machine learning by specifically
quantifying the accuracy of applying different ML techniques to the elementary
1D Poisson differential equation. Beyond the quantity and discretization of
data, we identify that the function space of the data is critical to the
generalization of the model. We prove generalization bounds and convergence
rates under finite data discretizations and restricted training data subspaces
by analyzing the training dynamics and deriving optimal parameters for both a
white-box differential equation discovery method and a black-box linear model.
The analytically derived generalization bounds are replicated empirically.
Similar lack of generalization is empirically demonstrated for deep linear
models, shallow neural networks, and physics-specific DeepONets and Neural
Operators. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that generalization to
the true physical equation is not guaranteed in each explored case.
Surprisingly, we find that different classes of models can exhibit opposing
generalization behaviors. Based on our theoretical analysis, we also
demonstrate a new mechanistic interpretability lens on scientific models
whereby Green's function representations can be extracted from the weights of
black-box models. Our results inform a new cross-validation technique for
measuring generalization in physical systems. We propose applying it to the
Poisson equation as an evaluation benchmark of future methods.

*Jenny Schmalfuss,Nadine Chang,Vibashan VS,Maying Shen,Andres Bruhn,Jose M. Alvarez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PARC, a framework for analyzing prompt sensitivity in vision language models (VLMs). It examines how variations in text and visual prompts affect VLMs' reliability and calibration, with significant findings tied to specific models and training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether VLMs inherit prompt sensitivity from large language models and identify the types of prompt variations that affect VLMs the most.

Method: Developed PARC, comprising plausible prompt variations, a reliability score with guarantees, and a calibration step, then evaluated 22 VLMs for prompt sensitivity and robustness.

Result: VLMs exhibit sensitivity to both language and vision prompt variations, similar to LLMs. InternVL2 family models demonstrated exceptional robustness, and prompt sensitivity appeared linked to training data.

Conclusion: Prompt sensitivity in VLMs is measurable and significant, with implications for model robustness and effective training. Robust models like InternVL2 show promise in mitigating the issue.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) respond to user-crafted text prompts and visual
inputs, and are applied to numerous real-world problems. VLMs integrate visual
modalities with large language models (LLMs), which are well known to be
prompt-sensitive. Hence, it is crucial to determine whether VLMs inherit this
instability to varying prompts. We therefore investigate which prompt
variations VLMs are most sensitive to and which VLMs are most agnostic to
prompt variations. To this end, we introduce PARC (Prompt Analysis via
Reliability and Calibration), a VLM prompt sensitivity analysis framework built
on three pillars: (1) plausible prompt variations in both the language and
vision domain, (2) a novel model reliability score with built-in guarantees,
and (3) a calibration step that enables dataset- and prompt-spanning prompt
variation analysis. Regarding prompt variations, PARC's evaluation shows that
VLMs mirror LLM language prompt sensitivity in the vision domain, and most
destructive variations change the expected answer. Regarding models,
outstandingly robust VLMs among 22 evaluated models come from the InternVL2
family. We further find indications that prompt sensitivity is linked to
training data. The code will be at https://github.com/NVlabs/PARC.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper evaluates federated learning (FL) for estimating BrainAGE, a neuroimaging biomarker, in stroke patients using MRI data from multiple centers, finding FL to be effective for preserving data privacy while maintaining robust predictions and associations with clinical outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of developing accurate BrainAGE estimation models while preserving patient privacy by avoiding data centralization.

Method: The study utilized FLAIR brain images from 1674 stroke patients across 16 hospital centers. Three approaches—centralized learning, federated learning, and single-site learning—were applied to train machine learning and deep learning models for BrainAGE estimation. Associations with vascular risk factors and stroke recovery outcomes were also analyzed.

Result: Centralized learning provided the most accurate results, but federated learning outperformed single-site models while maintaining data privacy. BrainAGE estimates were significantly higher in patients with diabetes mellitus, and showed strong associations with post-stroke functional outcomes.

Conclusion: Federated learning is a viable method for accurate BrainAGE estimation while preserving data privacy, offering potential for improved prognostic modeling in stroke patients by linking BrainAGE with clinical outcomes and vascular risk factors.

Abstract: $\textbf{Objective:}$ Brain-predicted age difference (BrainAGE) is a
neuroimaging biomarker reflecting brain health. However, training robust
BrainAGE models requires large datasets, often restricted by privacy concerns.
This study evaluates the performance of federated learning (FL) for BrainAGE
estimation in ischemic stroke patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy,
and investigates its association with clinical phenotypes and functional
outcomes.
  $\textbf{Methods:}$ We used FLAIR brain images from 1674 stroke patients
across 16 hospital centers. We implemented standard machine learning and deep
learning models for BrainAGE estimates under three data management strategies:
centralized learning (pooled data), FL (local training at each site), and
single-site learning. We reported prediction errors and examined associations
between BrainAGE and vascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes mellitus,
hypertension, smoking), as well as functional outcomes at three months
post-stroke. Logistic regression evaluated BrainAGE's predictive value for
these outcomes, adjusting for age, sex, vascular risk factors, stroke severity,
time between MRI and arterial puncture, prior intravenous thrombolysis, and
recanalisation outcome.
  $\textbf{Results:}$ While centralized learning yielded the most accurate
predictions, FL consistently outperformed single-site models. BrainAGE was
significantly higher in patients with diabetes mellitus across all models.
Comparisons between patients with good and poor functional outcomes, and
multivariate predictions of these outcomes showed the significance of the
association between BrainAGE and post-stroke recovery.
  $\textbf{Conclusion:}$ FL enables accurate age predictions without data
centralization. The strong association between BrainAGE, vascular risk factors,
and post-stroke recovery highlights its potential for prognostic modeling in
stroke care.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of forecasting sparse and intermittent demand in supply chains using a dynamic Model-Router framework that adapts forecasting models based on product-specific demand patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Demand patterns in supply chains often involve frequent zero-demand periods, making traditional forecasting models ineffective and leading to issues in inventory management.

Method: The authors use a Model-Router framework comprising various forecasting models—classic, machine learning, and deep learning—dynamically selected for each product's demand pattern using rule-based, LightGBM, and InceptionTime routing strategies.

Result: The InceptionTime router improves forecasting accuracy by up to 11.8% over single-model benchmarks with significantly faster inference times, demonstrating scalability and efficiency.

Conclusion: Intelligent and adaptive AI-based forecasting methods like the proposed framework can substantially reduce stockouts and excess inventory, optimizing supply chain operations.

Abstract: Sparse and intermittent demand forecasting in supply chains presents a
critical challenge, as frequent zero-demand periods hinder traditional model
accuracy and impact inventory management. We propose and evaluate a
Model-Router framework that dynamically selects the most suitable forecasting
model-spanning classical, ML, and DL methods for each product based on its
unique demand pattern. By comparing rule-based, LightGBM, and InceptionTime
routers, our approach learns to assign appropriate forecasting strategies,
effectively differentiating between smooth, lumpy, or intermittent demand
regimes to optimize predictions. Experiments on the large-scale Favorita
dataset show our deep learning (Inception Time) router improves forecasting
accuracy by up to 11.8% (NWRMSLE) over strong, single-model benchmarks with
4.67x faster inference time. Ultimately, these gains in forecasting precision
will drive substantial reductions in both stockouts and wasteful excess
inventory, underscoring the critical role of intelligent, adaptive Al in
optimizing contemporary supply chain operations.

TL;DR: The paper proposes MedSyn, a framework enabling interactive dialogue between physicians and Large Language Models (LLMs) to support clinical decision-making, addressing complexities in medical practice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical decision-making faces challenges such as cognitive biases, incomplete information, and case ambiguity. Current utilization of LLMs in healthcare overlooks these complexities and doesn't leverage interactive human-AI collaboration.

Method: The study introduces MedSyn, a hybrid framework allowing multi-step interactions between physicians and LLMs. Physicians challenge LLM suggestions, and in response, LLMs offer alternative perspectives during simulated dialogues.

Result: Simulated interactions demonstrate open-source LLMs' potential to assist physicians in refining diagnostic and treatment decisions effectively within MedSyn.

Conclusion: The dynamic human-AI collaboration proposed in MedSyn shows promise in enhancing medical decision-making, warranting future research involving real physician interactions to validate practical outcomes.

Abstract: Clinical decision-making is inherently complex, often influenced by cognitive
biases, incomplete information, and case ambiguity. Large Language Models
(LLMs) have shown promise as tools for supporting clinical decision-making, yet
their typical one-shot or limited-interaction usage may overlook the
complexities of real-world medical practice. In this work, we propose a hybrid
human-AI framework, MedSyn, where physicians and LLMs engage in multi-step,
interactive dialogues to refine diagnoses and treatment decisions. Unlike
static decision-support tools, MedSyn enables dynamic exchanges, allowing
physicians to challenge LLM suggestions while the LLM highlights alternative
perspectives. Through simulated physician-LLM interactions, we assess the
potential of open-source LLMs as physician assistants. Results show open-source
LLMs are promising as physician assistants in the real world. Future work will
involve real physician interactions to further validate MedSyn's usefulness in
diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes.

*Simiao Lin,Wannes Meert,Pieter Robberechts,Hendrik Blockeel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method to improve visual interpretability of how time series align and transform relative to each other.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is the lack of qualitative comparison techniques for time series analysis, especially in understanding structural relationships and transformations.

Method: The authors propose a technique that simplifies the warping path of elastic distance measures to visualize key transformations like shifts and amplitude differences.

Result: The method improves interpretability by offering clear visualizations of how subsequences align and transform between time series.

Conclusion: The proposed technique addresses the limitations of traditional visualizations, enabling better understanding of time series dynamics.

Abstract: Comparing time series is essential in various tasks such as clustering and
classification. While elastic distance measures that allow warping provide a
robust quantitative comparison, a qualitative comparison on top of them is
missing. Traditional visualizations focus on point-to-point alignment and do
not convey the broader structural relationships at the level of subsequences.
This limitation makes it difficult to understand how and where one time series
shifts, speeds up or slows down with respect to another. To address this, we
propose a novel technique that simplifies the warping path to highlight,
quantify and visualize key transformations (shift, compression, difference in
amplitude). By offering a clearer representation of how subsequences match
between time series, our method enhances interpretability in time series
comparison.

naturally avoids catastrophic forgetting and interference in continual
reinforcement learning. The structure of each module allows the selective
combination of previous policies along with its internal policy, accelerating
the learning process on the current task. Unlike previous growing neural
network approaches, we show that the number of parameters of the proposed
approach grows linearly with respect to the number of tasks, and does not
sacrifice plasticity to scale. Experiments conducted in benchmark continuous
control and visual problems reveal that the proposed approach achieves greater
knowledge transfer and performance than alternative methods.

### [172] [LIT-LVM: Structured Regularization for Interaction Terms in Linear Predictors using Latent Variable Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15492)
*Mohammadreza Nemati,Zhipeng Huang,Kevin S. Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper focuses on improving the estimation of interaction term coefficients in linear predictors by introducing a low-dimensional latent vector representation approach, achieving better prediction accuracy than conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately estimating coefficients for interaction terms in linear predictors remains challenging, especially in high-dimensional settings. The authors aim to mitigate overfitting and improve prediction accuracy.

Method: The authors propose LIT-LVM, a structured regularization approach using latent vector representation for features in a low-dimensional space, leveraging it to estimate coefficients of interaction terms effectively.

Result: LIT-LVM outperforms elastic net and factorization machines across simulated and real datasets, particularly when interaction terms significantly outnumber samples.

Conclusion: LIT-LVM improves prediction accuracy, reduces overfitting, and provides useful latent feature representations for visualization and relationship analysis in high-dimensional linear predictors.

Abstract: Some of the simplest, yet most frequently used predictors in statistics and
machine learning use weighted linear combinations of features. Such linear
predictors can model non-linear relationships between features by adding
interaction terms corresponding to the products of all pairs of features. We
consider the problem of accurately estimating coefficients for interaction
terms in linear predictors. We hypothesize that the coefficients for different
interaction terms have an approximate low-dimensional structure and represent
each feature by a latent vector in a low-dimensional space. This
low-dimensional representation can be viewed as a structured regularization
approach that further mitigates overfitting in high-dimensional settings beyond
standard regularizers such as the lasso and elastic net. We demonstrate that
our approach, called LIT-LVM, achieves superior prediction accuracy compared to
elastic net and factorization machines on a wide variety of simulated and real
data, particularly when the number of interaction terms is high compared to the
number of samples. LIT-LVM also provides low-dimensional latent representations
for features that are useful for visualizing and analyzing their relationships.

*Yuxuan Jiang,Ziming Zhou,Boyu Xu,Beijie Liu,Runhui Xu,Peng Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces TRAINCHECK, a framework to proactively detect silent training errors in deep learning using automatically inferred invariants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Silent errors during deep learning model training are hard to identify and debug, necessitating a tool to proactively address this issue.

Method: TRAINCHECK uses invariant inference techniques to monitor deep learning training, detect silent errors, and assist debugging.

Result: TRAINCHECK detects 18 out of 20 reproduced silent errors within one iteration and finds 6 previously unknown bugs in popular training libraries.

Conclusion: Proactively monitoring training with TRAINCHECK is effective in identifying and diagnosing silent errors, proving it to be a valuable tool for deep learning practitioners.

Abstract: Training deep learning (DL) models is a complex process, making it prone to
silent errors that are challenging to detect and diagnose. This paper presents
TRAINCHECK, a framework that takes a proactive checking approach to address
silent training errors. TRAINCHECK automatically infers invariants tailored for
DL training. It uses these invariants to proactively detect silent errors
during the training process while providing debugging help. To evaluate
TRAINCHECK, we reproduce 20 real-world silent training errors with diverse root
causes. TRAINCHECK successfully detects 18 errors within a single training
iteration. It also uncovers 6 unknown bugs in popular training libraries that
lead to silent errors.

*Alexandru Meterez,Depen Morwani,Costin-Andrei Oncescu,Jingfeng Wu,Cengiz Pehlevan,Sham Kakade*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper simplifies the analysis of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for linear regression, recovering existing bounds without requiring complex manipulations of positive semi-definite matrices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To make the theoretical analysis of SGD for linear regression more accessible and facilitate further improvements in practical training methods like mini-batching and learning rate scheduling.

Method: The authors provide a simplified analysis using basic linear algebra tools, avoiding complex manipulations of positive semi-definite matrices.

Result: The paper achieves the same bias and variance bounds as a recent work by Zou et al. but with a simpler analytical framework.

Conclusion: This simplified analysis is expected to make SGD more comprehensible and practical for improving training algorithms for realistic models.

Abstract: Theoretically understanding stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in
overparameterized models has led to the development of several optimization
algorithms that are widely used in practice today. Recent work
by~\citet{zou2021benign} provides sharp rates for SGD optimization in linear
regression using constant learning rate, both with and without tail iterate
averaging, based on a bias-variance decomposition of the risk. In our work, we
provide a simplified analysis recovering the same bias and variance bounds
provided in~\citep{zou2021benign} based on simple linear algebra tools,
bypassing the requirement to manipulate operators on positive semi-definite
(PSD) matrices. We believe our work makes the analysis of SGD on linear
regression very accessible and will be helpful in further analyzing
mini-batching and learning rate scheduling, leading to improvements in the
training of realistic models.

*Gyaneshwar Agrahari,Kiran Bist,Monika Pandey,Jacob Kapita,Zachary James,Jackson Knox,Steven Heymsfield,Sophia Ramirez,Peter Wolenski,Nadejda Drenska*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces machine learning models, specifically the $p$-Laplacian regression model, to predict body composition metrics typically measured by costly DXA scans, achieving promising error rates even with limited training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenges posed by the high cost and time-consuming nature of DXA scans, offering early diagnosis metrics for chronic diseases using accessible biomarkers and 3D optical imaging.

Method: The authors applied statistical and machine learning methods, notably a semi-supervised $p$-Laplacian regression model, alongside supervised models like SVR and LS-SVR, to predict body composition variables using data extracted from 3D optical images of 847 patients.

Result: The $p$-Laplacian model demonstrated error rates of ~13% for ALM, ~10% for BMD, and ~20% for BFP with just 10% training data. Among supervised models, SVR achieved ~8% error for ALM and BMD, while LS-SVR yielded ~11% error for BFP when training data was increased to 80%.

Conclusion: The $p$-Laplacian regression model is shown to be effective in predicting body composition variables in a data-constrained setting for healthcare applications. Supervised models like SVR also demonstrated strong performance when more training data was available.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of anthropometric body composition variables, such as
Appendicular Lean Mass (ALM), Body Fat Percentage (BFP), and Bone Mineral
Density (BMD), is essential for early diagnosis of several chronic diseases.
Currently, researchers rely on Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) scans to
measure these metrics; however, DXA scans are costly and time-consuming. This
work proposes an alternative to DXA scans by applying statistical and machine
learning models on biomarkers (height, volume, left calf circumference, etc)
obtained from 3D optical images. The dataset consists of 847 patients and was
sourced from Pennington Biomedical Research Center. Extracting patients' data
in healthcare faces many technical challenges and legal restrictions. However,
most supervised machine learning algorithms are inherently data-intensive,
requiring a large amount of training data. To overcome these limitations, we
implemented a semi-supervised model, the $p$-Laplacian regression model. This
paper is the first to demonstrate the application of a $p$-Laplacian model for
regression. Our $p$-Laplacian model yielded errors of $\sim13\%$ for ALM,
$\sim10\%$ for BMD, and $\sim20\%$ for BFP when the training data accounted for
10 percent of all data. Among the supervised algorithms we implemented, Support
Vector Regression (SVR) performed the best for ALM and BMD, yielding errors of
$\sim 8\%$ for both, while Least Squares SVR performed the best for BFP with
$\sim 11\%$ error when trained on 80 percent of the data. Our findings position
the $p$-Laplacian model as a promising tool for healthcare applications,
particularly in a data-constrained environment.

*Sunil Kumar,Bowen Zhao,Leo Dirac,Paulina Varshavskaya*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for training smaller vision-language models (VLMs) with tool-assisted reasoning to improve visual question-answering (VQA) performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limited visual reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) when computational resources are constrained.

Method: Train smaller-scale VLMs using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) combined with external tools like zoom, a simplified tool interface, additional visualization tokens, and specialized training data.

Result: The proposed approach outperforms similarly-sized baseline models in specific visual question-answering (VQA) tasks by effectively utilizing detailed visual information from tools.

Conclusion: Smaller VLMs, aided by external tools and optimized training strategies, can achieve enhanced visual reasoning, making them effective even with limited computational resources.

Abstract: Despite tremendous recent advances in large model reasoning ability,
vision-language models (VLMs) still struggle with detailed visual reasoning,
especially when compute resources are limited. To address this challenge, we
draw inspiration from methods like Deepseek-r1 for VLMs and train smaller-scale
models with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to use external tools
such as zoom. The greatest benefit is obtained with a combination of GRPO
learning, a simple reward structure, a simplified tool-calling interface,
allocating additional tokens to the result of the tool call, and a training
data mix that over-represents visually difficult examples. Compared to
similarly-sized baseline models, our method achieves better performance on some
visual question-answering (VQA) tasks, thanks to the detailed visual
information gathered from the external tool.

*Yao Zhang,Hewei Gao,Haokun Chen,Weiguo Li,Yunpu Ma,Volker Tresp*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FedNano, an FL framework designed for effective use with MLLMs, centralizing LLMs on servers while employing lightweight modules on clients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with deployment in distributed environments due to privacy concerns, client heterogeneity, high computational demands, and communication costs.

Method: FedNano utilizes a centralized LLM on the server and lightweight client modules (NanoEdge) equipped with modality-specific encoders and adapters for efficient adaptation.

Result: FedNano reduces client storage by 95%, minimizes communication overhead to 0.01% of model parameters, and outperforms existing FL baselines in scalability and effectiveness.

Conclusion: FedNano bridges MLLM scalability with FL feasibility, enhancing privacy-preserving decentralized multimodal AI systems.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in tasks like multimodal
reasoning and cross-modal retrieval but face deployment challenges in
real-world scenarios due to distributed multimodal data and strict privacy
requirements. Federated Learning (FL) offers a solution by enabling
collaborative model training without centralizing data. However, realizing FL
for MLLMs presents significant challenges, including high computational
demands, limited client capacity, substantial communication costs, and
heterogeneous client data. Existing FL methods assume client-side deployment of
full models, an assumption that breaks down for large-scale MLLMs due to their
massive size and communication demands. To address these limitations, we
propose FedNano, the first FL framework that centralizes the LLM on the server
while introducing NanoEdge, a lightweight module for client-specific
adaptation. NanoEdge employs modality-specific encoders, connectors, and
trainable NanoAdapters with low-rank adaptation. This design eliminates the
need to deploy LLM on clients, reducing client-side storage by 95%, and
limiting communication overhead to only 0.01% of the model parameters. By
transmitting only compact NanoAdapter updates, FedNano handles heterogeneous
client data and resource constraints while preserving privacy. Experiments
demonstrate that FedNano outperforms prior FL baselines, bridging the gap
between MLLM scale and FL feasibility, and enabling scalable, decentralized
multimodal AI systems.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates different surrogate models for predicting the properties of high-entropy alloys (HEAs) and identifies Deep Gaussian Processes (DGP) as the most effective model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve predictive modeling accuracy for high-entropy alloys (HEAs), leveraging limited experimental and computational datasets to optimize materials design.

Method: Four surrogate models—conventional Gaussian Processes (cGP), Deep Gaussian Processes (DGP), encoder-decoder neural networks for multi-output regression, and XGBoost—are systematically applied and compared against a hybrid dataset.

Result: The study finds that DGP outperformed other models by better capturing inter-property correlations and input-dependent uncertainties in the HEA system.

Conclusion: Advanced surrogate models like DGP infused with machine learning priors offer enhanced predictive capabilities, thus serving as reliable tools for efficient materials design.

Abstract: Surrogate modeling techniques have become indispensable in accelerating the
discovery and optimization of high-entropy alloys(HEAs), especially when
integrating computational predictions with sparse experimental observations.
This study systematically evaluates the fitting performance of four prominent
surrogate models conventional Gaussian Processes(cGP), Deep Gaussian
Processes(DGP), encoder-decoder neural networks for multi-output regression and
XGBoost applied to a hybrid dataset of experimental and computational
properties in the AlCoCrCuFeMnNiV HEA system. We specifically assess their
capabilities in predicting correlated material properties, including yield
strength, hardness, modulus, ultimate tensile strength, elongation, and average
hardness under dynamic and quasi-static conditions, alongside auxiliary
computational properties. The comparison highlights the strengths of
hierarchical and deep modeling approaches in handling heteroscedastic,
heterotopic, and incomplete data commonly encountered in materials informatics.
Our findings illustrate that DGP infused with machine learning-based prior
outperform other surrogates by effectively capturing inter-property
correlations and input-dependent uncertainty. This enhanced predictive accuracy
positions advanced surrogate models as powerful tools for robust and
data-efficient materials design.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CACTUS, a tool to improve AMD diagnosis using explainable ML approaches while addressing data limitations and biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve early diagnosis for AMD, a critical condition impacting older adults, by leveraging multi-dimensional data like genetics, diet, and clinical factors.

Method: The CACTUS tool integrates diverse healthcare data, offering explainability and flexibility to enhance AMD stage classification.

Result: CACTUS outperforms traditional ML models in accuracy and reliability, while identifying key features tied to medical knowledge.

Conclusion: CACTUS boosts decision-making confidence and enables clinicians to address biases and validate insights through explainable results.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) is used to tackle various tasks, such as disease
classification and prediction. The effectiveness of ML models relies heavily on
having large amounts of complete data. However, healthcare data is often
limited or incomplete, which can hinder model performance. Additionally, issues
like the trustworthiness of solutions vary with the datasets used. The lack of
transparency in some ML models further complicates their understanding and use.
In healthcare, particularly in the case of Age-related Macular Degeneration
(AMD), which affects millions of older adults, early diagnosis is crucial due
to the absence of effective treatments for reversing progression. Diagnosing
AMD involves assessing retinal images along with patients' symptom reports.
There is a need for classification approaches that consider genetic, dietary,
clinical, and demographic factors. Recently, we introduced the -Comprehensive
Abstraction and Classification Tool for Uncovering Structures-(CACTUS), aimed
at improving AMD stage classification. CACTUS offers explainability and
flexibility, outperforming standard ML models. It enhances decision-making by
identifying key factors and providing confidence in its results. The important
features identified by CACTUS allow us to compare with existing medical
knowledge. By eliminating less relevant or biased data, we created a clinical
scenario for clinicians to offer feedback and address biases.

TL;DR: The paper proposes GRKneg for OC-SVM to improve one-class classification with limited negative samples. It shows superior performance over traditional OC-SVM and binary SVM in low negative sample scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to improve one-class classification performance when limited negative samples are available.

Method: Introduction of Generalized Reference Kernel with Negative Samples (GRKneg) to enhance OC-SVM using improved kernel methods without altering the original optimization mechanism.

Result: GRKneg consistently outperformed standard OC-SVM using Radial Basis Function kernel and showed advantages over binary SVM when negative samples were scarce.

Conclusion: GRKneg is effective in enhancing OC-SVM performance, highlighting its potential for scenarios with minimal negative sample availability.

Abstract: This paper focuses on small-scale one-class classification with some negative
samples available. We propose Generalized Reference Kernel with Negative
Samples (GRKneg) for One-class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM). We study
different ways to select/generate the reference vectors and recommend an
approach for the problem at hand. It is worth noting that the proposed method
does not use any labels in the model optimization but uses the original OC-SVM
implementation. Only the kernel used in the process is improved using the
negative data. We compare our method with the standard OC-SVM and with the
binary Support Vector Machine (SVM) using different amounts of negative
samples. Our approach consistently outperforms the standard OC-SVM using Radial
Basis Function kernel. When there are plenty of negative samples, the binary
SVM outperforms the one-class approaches as expected, but we show that for the
lowest numbers of negative samples the proposed approach clearly outperforms
the binary SVM.

*Ganyu Wang,Jinjie Fang,Maxwell J. Ying,Bin Gu,Xi Chen,Boyu Wang,Charles Ling*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FedOne, a method for optimizing query efficiency in federated black-box discrete prompt learning for cloud-based LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cloud-based LLM services face high query costs in federated black-box prompt tuning which need efficient solutions.

Method: Combining theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, the authors propose FedOne, which activates only one client per round for optimal query efficiency.

Result: The FedOne framework significantly improved query efficiency in federated prompt learning, as demonstrated by theoretical and experimental comparisons.

Conclusion: FedOne proves effective in minimizing query costs, facilitating practical federated black-box prompt learning with cloud-based LLMs.

Abstract: Black-Box Discrete Prompt Learning is a prompt-tuning method that optimizes
discrete prompts without accessing model parameters or gradients, making the
prompt tuning on a cloud-based Large Language Model (LLM) feasible. Adapting
federated learning to BDPL could further enhance prompt tuning performance by
leveraging data from diverse sources. However, all previous research on
federated black-box prompt tuning had neglected the substantial query cost
associated with the cloud-based LLM service. To address this gap, we conducted
a theoretical analysis of query efficiency within the context of federated
black-box prompt tuning. Our findings revealed that degrading FedAvg to
activate only one client per round, a strategy we called \textit{FedOne},
enabled optimal query efficiency in federated black-box prompt learning.
Building on this insight, we proposed the FedOne framework, a federated
black-box discrete prompt learning method designed to maximize query efficiency
when interacting with cloud-based LLMs. We conducted numerical experiments on
various aspects of our framework, demonstrating a significant improvement in
query efficiency, which aligns with our theoretical results.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of setting thresholds in anomaly detection systems based on autoencoders and proposes using machine learning algorithms for automatic threshold definition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in overcoming the challenges posed by data imbalances and improving the performance of anomaly detection systems by refining the threshold for classifying reconstruction errors.

Method: Three machine learning algorithms—K-Nearest Neighbors, K-Means, and Support Vector Machine—are evaluated for their effectiveness in automating threshold definition for anomaly detection.

Result: The paper evaluates the performance of these algorithms but does not detail specific outcomes in the abstract.

Conclusion: Automatically defining thresholds through machine learning could enhance the functionality and accuracy of anomaly detection systems using autoencoders.

Abstract: Currently, digital security mechanisms like Anomaly Detection Systems using
Autoencoders (AE) show great potential for bypassing problems intrinsic to the
data, such as data imbalance. Because AE use a non-trivial and nonstandardized
separation threshold to classify the extracted reconstruction error, the
definition of this threshold directly impacts the performance of the detection
process. Thus, this work proposes the automatic definition of this threshold
using some machine learning algorithms. For this, three algorithms were
evaluated: the K-Nearst Neighbors, the K-Means and the Support Vector Machine.

TL;DR: This paper presents 'Guru,' a reinforcement learning (RL) framework with a reasoning corpus of 92K examples across six domains, demonstrating nuanced RL effects on large language models (LLMs) and producing state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limited applicability of RL for improving large language model (LLM) reasoning by creating a corpus spanning diverse reasoning domains and examining RL's broader influence.

Method: The authors developed a reasoning corpus, 'Guru,' consisting of 92K examples built using domain-specific reward design and filtration, systematically evaluating RL-trained models across six domains.

Result: The Guru-7B and Guru-32B models achieve state-of-the-art performance, improving baseline models by 7.9% and 6.7% across 17 reasoning tasks, with notable improvements in domains minimally represented during pretraining.

Conclusion: RL, when trained on suitable data (like Guru), can genuinely enhance reasoning capabilities in LLMs, particularly in less-pretrained domains, facilitating significant advances in skill acquisition and task performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach to improve
large language model (LLM) reasoning, yet most open efforts focus narrowly on
math and code, limiting our understanding of its broader applicability to
general reasoning. A key challenge lies in the lack of reliable, scalable RL
reward signals across diverse reasoning domains. We introduce Guru, a curated
RL reasoning corpus of 92K verifiable examples spanning six reasoning
domains--Math, Code, Science, Logic, Simulation, and Tabular--each built
through domain-specific reward design, deduplication, and filtering to ensure
reliability and effectiveness for RL training. Based on Guru, we systematically
revisit established findings in RL for LLM reasoning and observe significant
variation across domains. For example, while prior work suggests that RL
primarily elicits existing knowledge from pretrained models, our results reveal
a more nuanced pattern: domains frequently seen during pretraining (Math, Code,
Science) easily benefit from cross-domain RL training, while domains with
limited pretraining exposure (Logic, Simulation, and Tabular) require in-domain
training to achieve meaningful performance gains, suggesting that RL is likely
to facilitate genuine skill acquisition. Finally, we present Guru-7B and
Guru-32B, two models that achieve state-of-the-art performance among open
models RL-trained with publicly available data, outperforming best baselines by
7.9% and 6.7% on our 17-task evaluation suite across six reasoning domains. We
also show that our models effectively improve the Pass@k performance of their
base models, particularly on complex tasks less likely to appear in pretraining
data. We release data, models, training and evaluation code to facilitate
general-purpose reasoning at: https://github.com/LLM360/Reasoning360

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Overlap-aware Disagreement Discrepancy (ODD), a new approach for reliably estimating the error of machine learning models in unseen test domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately estimating ML model errors in unseen test domains is critical for safe intelligent systems.

Method: The method utilizes ODD to optimize disagreement only in the non-overlapping target domain, using domain-classifiers to estimate domain-overlap.

Result: ODD improves performance-estimation error compared to previous methods like DIS^2 while maintaining reliability and validity.

Conclusion: ODD offers a better error-bound prediction approach in unseen test domains, resolving previous issues in overlapping regions and improving accuracy.

Abstract: Reliable and accurate estimation of the error of an ML model in unseen test
domains is an important problem for safe intelligent systems. Prior work uses
disagreement discrepancy (DIS^2) to derive practical error bounds under
distribution shifts. It optimizes for a maximally disagreeing classifier on the
target domain to bound the error of a given source classifier. Although this
approach offers a reliable and competitively accurate estimate of the target
error, we identify a problem in this approach which causes the disagreement
discrepancy objective to compete in the overlapping region between source and
target domains. With an intuitive assumption that the target disagreement
should be no more than the source disagreement in the overlapping region due to
high enough support, we devise Overlap-aware Disagreement Discrepancy (ODD).
Maximizing ODD only requires disagreement in the non-overlapping target domain,
removing the competition. Our ODD-based bound uses domain-classifiers to
estimate domain-overlap and better predicts target performance than DIS^2. We
conduct experiments on a wide array of benchmarks to show that our method
improves the overall performance-estimation error while remaining valid and
reliable. Our code and results are available on GitHub.

TL;DR: This study explores hallucinations in embodied agents that use large language models (LLMs), focusing on inconsistencies between tasks and environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate hallucinations in LLM-based agents during long-horizon tasks with environmental-task mismatches.

Method: A benchmark test is developed to induce hallucinations, and 12 models are analyzed in two simulation environments.

Result: The evaluated models fail to resolve scene-task mismatches and display limitations in handling infeasible tasks, with hallucination rates increasing significantly.

Conclusion: This paper highlights issues with LLM-based agents in grounding tasks and provides guidance for improving reliability in task planning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted as the cognitive
core of embodied agents. However, inherited hallucinations, which stem from
failures to ground user instructions in the observed physical environment, can
lead to navigation errors, such as searching for a refrigerator that does not
exist. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of hallucinations
in LLM-based embodied agents performing long-horizon tasks under scene-task
inconsistencies. Our goal is to understand to what extent hallucinations occur,
what types of inconsistencies trigger them, and how current models respond. To
achieve these goals, we construct a hallucination probing set by building on an
existing benchmark, capable of inducing hallucination rates up to 40x higher
than base prompts. Evaluating 12 models across two simulation environments, we
find that while models exhibit reasoning, they fail to resolve scene-task
inconsistencies-highlighting fundamental limitations in handling infeasible
tasks. We also provide actionable insights on ideal model behavior for each
scenario, offering guidance for developing more robust and reliable planning
strategies.

TL;DR: This paper employs advanced foundation models and machine learning to predict MS disability progression, demonstrating improvement when combining clinical and digital data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate early prediction of MS progression is difficult due to disease heterogeneity, necessitating novel methods to improve prognostics.

Method: Used baseline clinical data and 12 weeks of digital data from a clinical trial, applying advanced foundation models, multimodal transformers, and machine learning techniques.

Result: A multimodal transformer outperformed unimodal models, showing improved prediction (AUROC 0.63) by integrating clinical and digital data.

Conclusion: Foundation models and multimodal approaches enhance predictive accuracy for MS, showcasing potential for other complex diseases.

Abstract: Early multiple sclerosis (MS) disability progression prediction is
challenging due to disease heterogeneity. This work predicts 48- and 72-week
disability using sparse baseline clinical data and 12 weeks of daily digital
Floodlight data from the CONSONANCE clinical trial. We employed
state-of-the-art tabular and time-series foundation models (FMs), a custom
multimodal attention-based transformer, and machine learning methods. Despite
the difficulty of early prediction (AUROC 0.63), integrating digital data via
advanced models improved performance over clinical data alone. A transformer
model using unimodal embeddings from the Moment FM yielded the best result, but
our multimodal transformer consistently outperformed its unimodal counterpart,
confirming the advantages of combining clinical with digital data. Our findings
demonstrate the promise of FMs and multimodal approaches to extract predictive
signals from complex and diverse clinical and digital life sciences data (e.g.,
imaging, omics), enabling more accurate prognostics for MS and potentially
other complex diseases.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to improve fairness and efficiency in multi-agent decision-making under uncertainty using multi-armed bandit algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address fairness concerns in decision-making for multi-agent systems while maximizing overall system performance.

Method: The paper proposes a probing mechanism in offline and online settings, utilizing submodular optimization and an algorithm with sublinear regret for information gathering and allocation.

Result: Experimental evaluations indicate superior fairness and efficiency over baseline methods on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The framework effectively balances fairness and performance, demonstrating its applicability in diverse scenarios.

Abstract: We propose a multi-agent multi-armed bandit (MA-MAB) framework aimed at
ensuring fair outcomes across agents while maximizing overall system
performance. A key challenge in this setting is decision-making under limited
information about arm rewards. To address this, we introduce a novel probing
framework that strategically gathers information about selected arms before
allocation. In the offline setting, where reward distributions are known, we
leverage submodular properties to design a greedy probing algorithm with a
provable performance bound. For the more complex online setting, we develop an
algorithm that achieves sublinear regret while maintaining fairness. Extensive
experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our approach
outperforms baseline methods, achieving better fairness and efficiency.

### [188] [Stable CDE Autoencoders with Acuity Regularization for Offline Reinforcement Learning in Sepsis Treatment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15019)
*Yue Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses unstable training in sequential representation learning for sepsis treatment RL, proposing controlled differential equation (CDE) representations with training stabilization methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve reinforcement learning policies for sepsis treatment by addressing the challenge of unstable training in learning sequential representations from ICU time series.

Method: The authors utilize Controlled Differential Equations (CDE) for state representations, employing early stopping and stabilization methods to ensure training stability, and incorporating acuity-aware correlations with clinical scores.

Result: Experiments on MIMIC-III dataset reveal that stable CDE representations correlate well with clinical acuity scores and achieve high policy performance (WIS return > 0.9), whereas unstable training leads to poor results.

Conclusion: Training stability is critical in representation learning for clinical RL, and practical guidelines are provided for utilizing CDEs in encoding irregular medical time series effectively.

Abstract: Effective reinforcement learning (RL) for sepsis treatment depends on
learning stable, clinically meaningful state representations from irregular ICU
time series. While previous works have explored representation learning for
this task, the critical challenge of training instability in sequential
representations and its detrimental impact on policy performance has been
overlooked. This work demonstrates that Controlled Differential Equations (CDE)
state representation can achieve strong RL policies when two key factors are
met: (1) ensuring training stability through early stopping or stabilization
methods, and (2) enforcing acuity-aware representations by correlation
regularization with clinical scores (SOFA, SAPS-II, OASIS). Experiments on the
MIMIC-III sepsis cohort reveal that stable CDE autoencoder produces
representations strongly correlated with acuity scores and enables RL policies
with superior performance (WIS return $> 0.9$). In contrast, unstable CDE
representation leads to degraded representations and policy failure (WIS return
$\sim$ 0). Visualizations of the latent space show that stable CDEs not only
separate survivor and non-survivor trajectories but also reveal clear acuity
score gradients, whereas unstable training fails to capture either pattern.
These findings highlight practical guidelines for using CDEs to encode
irregular medical time series in clinical RL, emphasizing the need for training
stability in sequential representation learning.

*Gyuhak Kim,Sumiran Singh Thakur,Su Min Park,Wei Wei,Yujia Bao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SFT-GO enhances large language models by grouping tokens based on importance and optimizing learning using a unique loss function, leading to better model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fine-tuning methods do not differentiate between tokens' importance, potentially missing critical information.

Method: SFT-GO groups tokens based on importance and employs a loss function combining worst-group loss and standard cross-entropy to adaptively optimize learning.

Result: SFT-GO consistently outperformed baseline methods across datasets and models in testing benchmarks.

Conclusion: SFT-GO is a robust and effective fine-tuning approach, improving learning dynamics and handling diverse token group distributions.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has become an essential step in tailoring large
language models (LLMs) to align with human expectations and specific downstream
tasks. However, existing SFT methods typically treat each training instance as
a uniform sequence, giving equal importance to all tokens regardless of their
relevance. This overlooks the fact that only a subset of tokens often contains
critical, task-specific information. To address this limitation, we introduce
Supervised Fine-Tuning with Group Optimization (SFT-GO), a novel approach that
treats groups of tokens differently based on their importance.SFT-GO groups
tokens in each sample based on their importance values and optimizes the LLM
using a weighted combination of the worst-group loss and the standard
cross-entropy loss. This mechanism adaptively emphasizes the most challenging
token groups and guides the model to better handle different group
distributions, thereby improving overall learning dynamics. We provide a
theoretical analysis of SFT-GO's convergence rate, demonstrating its
efficiency. Empirically, we apply SFT-GO with three different token grouping
strategies and show that models trained with SFT-GO consistently outperform
baseline approaches across popular LLM benchmarks. These improvements hold
across various datasets and base models, demonstrating the robustness and the
effectiveness of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the time and computational cost challenges of reinforcement learning in neural architecture search and hyperparameter optimization.

Method: The method, SPG, modifies conventional policy gradient techniques by integrating temporary modules for single forward-pass trajectory generation, inspired by DeepSeek-V3.

Result: SPG demonstrates consistent improvements of 0.2% to 7% on five diverse datasets (ImageNet, COCO, GLUE, SQuAD, SUPERB), outperforming standard fine-tuning approaches.

Conclusion: SPG offers a computationally efficient and effective approach to hyperparameter optimization with broad applicability, supported by fully reproducible resources.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning is essential for neural architecture search and
hyperparameter optimization, but the conventional approaches impede widespread
use due to prohibitive time and computational costs. Inspired by DeepSeek-V3
multi-token prediction architecture, we propose Sequential Policy Gradient
modeling (SPG), a novel trajectory generation paradigm for lightweight online
hyperparameter optimization. In contrast to conventional policy gradient
methods, SPG extends the base model with temporary modules, enabling it to
generate state-action (padded) trajectories in a single forward pass. Our
experiments demonstrate that models gain performance when retrained with SPG on
their original datasets and also outperform standard transfer fine-tuning. We
evaluate on five datasets spanning computer vision (ImageNet, COCO), natural
language processing (GLUE, SQuAD), and audio (SUPERB) to assess the industrial
applicability of SPG. The proposed method demonstrates consistent improvements
across widely adopted models, achieving performance gains of $+0.2\sim7\%$,
with significantly low computational costs. Fully reproducible code and

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper reviews existing methods for verifying machine unlearning, categorizes them, evaluates their strengths and weaknesses, and outlines open challenges in the field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The demand for privacy, security, and legal compliance has increased the need for machine unlearning techniques and robust verification methods to ensure their successful implementation.

Method: The paper conducts a structured survey and introduces a taxonomy that classifies unlearning verification methods into behavioral and parametric categories.

Result: A comprehensive analysis of current verification methods was performed, including their assumptions, strengths, weaknesses, and practical vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: The authors emphasize the need for more robust and theoretically grounded verification mechanisms and highlight open problems to advance the field.

Abstract: With growing demands for privacy protection, security, and legal compliance
(e.g., GDPR), machine unlearning has emerged as a critical technique for
ensuring the controllability and regulatory alignment of machine learning
models. However, a fundamental challenge in this field lies in effectively
verifying whether unlearning operations have been successfully and thoroughly
executed. Despite a growing body of work on unlearning techniques, verification
methodologies remain comparatively underexplored and often fragmented. Existing
approaches lack a unified taxonomy and a systematic framework for evaluation.
To bridge this gap, this paper presents the first structured survey of machine
unlearning verification methods. We propose a taxonomy that organizes current
techniques into two principal categories -- behavioral verification and
parametric verification -- based on the type of evidence used to assess
unlearning fidelity. We examine representative methods within each category,
analyze their underlying assumptions, strengths, and limitations, and identify
potential vulnerabilities in practical deployment. In closing, we articulate a
set of open problems in current verification research, aiming to provide a
foundation for developing more robust, efficient, and theoretically grounded
unlearning verification mechanisms.

*Bing Liu,Chengcheng Zhao,Li Chai,Peng Cheng,Yaonan Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes ImprovDML, a decentralized framework addressing the trade-off between privacy, Byzantine-resilience, and model accuracy in distributed machine learning using advanced algorithms and privacy notions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome the challenges of balancing privacy, resilience to Byzantine attacks, and model accuracy in distributed machine learning.

Method: They utilize resilient vector consensus algorithms for aggregation and introduce multivariate Gaussian noise for privacy, supported by convergence guarantees and new error bounds.

Result: The paper achieves tighter error bounds compared to existing works, introduces improved privacy quantification, and validates their approach through numerical simulations.

Conclusion: ImprovDML successfully balances privacy, Byzantine-resilience, and model accuracy, improving upon existing methods in distributed machine learning.

Abstract: Jointly addressing Byzantine attacks and privacy leakage in distributed
machine learning (DML) has become an important issue. A common strategy
involves integrating Byzantine-resilient aggregation rules with differential
privacy mechanisms. However, the incorporation of these techniques often
results in a significant degradation in model accuracy. To address this issue,
we propose a decentralized DML framework, named ImprovDML, that achieves high
model accuracy while simultaneously ensuring privacy preservation and
resilience to Byzantine attacks. The framework leverages a kind of resilient
vector consensus algorithms that can compute a point within the normal
(non-Byzantine) agents' convex hull for resilient aggregation at each
iteration. Then, multivariate Gaussian noises are introduced to the gradients
for privacy preservation. We provide convergence guarantees and derive
asymptotic learning error bounds under non-convex settings, which are tighter
than those reported in existing works. For the privacy analysis, we adopt the
notion of concentrated geo-privacy, which quantifies privacy preservation based
on the Euclidean distance between inputs. We demonstrate that it enables an
improved trade-off between privacy preservation and model accuracy compared to
differential privacy. Finally, numerical simulations validate our theoretical
results.

### [193] [Learning Task-Agnostic Skill Bases to Uncover Motor Primitives in Animal Behaviors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15190)
*Jiyi Wang,Jingyang Ke,Bo Dai,Anqi Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces SKIL, a framework for behavior understanding in animals, focusing on dynamic combination of motor primitives for task adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current behavior-segmentation methods oversimplify animal behavior by assuming discrete syllables under restrictive assumptions, failing to capture the flexible recombination of core motor primitives.

Method: The SKIL framework uses reinforcement learning to infer interpretable skill sets (latent basis functions) and parameterizes policies as dynamic mixtures of these skills. It relies on representation learning of transition probabilities.

Result: Validation of SKIL on grid worlds, labyrinths, and videos shows its ability to identify reusable skill components, learn evolving compositional policies, and generate realistic trajectories beyond traditional models.

Conclusion: SKIL demonstrates how complex animal behaviors can emerge from dynamically combining fundamental motor primitives, offering a concise and principled understanding of behavior generation.

Abstract: Animals flexibly recombine a finite set of core motor primitives to meet
diverse task demands, but existing behavior-segmentation methods oversimplify
this process by imposing discrete syllables under restrictive generative
assumptions. To reflect the animal behavior generation procedure, we introduce
skill-based imitation learning (SKIL) for behavior understanding, a
reinforcement learning-based imitation framework that (1) infers interpretable
skill sets, i.e., latent basis functions of behavior, by leveraging
representation learning on transition probabilities, and (2) parameterizes
policies as dynamic mixtures of these skills. We validate our approach on a
simple grid world, a discrete labyrinth, and unconstrained videos of freely
moving animals. Across tasks, it identifies reusable skill components, learns
continuously evolving compositional policies, and generates realistic
trajectories beyond the capabilities of traditional discrete models. By
exploiting generative behavior modeling with compositional representations, our
method offers a concise, principled account of how complex animal behaviors
emerge from dynamic combinations of fundamental motor primitives.

### [194] [Singular Value Decomposition on Kronecker Adaptation for Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15251)
*Yee Hin Chong,Peng Qu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces SoKA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for Transformer models that improves convergence and model efficiency while reducing trainable parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning large Transformer models is resource-intensive, so there is a need for parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques that avoid high storage, memory, and computational costs.

Method: The authors propose SoKA, which combines Kronecker-product tensor factorization, SVD-driven initialization, and spectrum-aware dynamic rank selection. These techniques enable efficient adaptation with minimal task-specific parameters.

Result: SoKA achieves competitive performance on LLaMA2-7B across tasks like arithmetic reasoning, formal mathematics, and code generation, requiring only 0.99M trainable parameters (25% fewer than LoRA/PiSSA) and showing faster convergence.

Conclusion: SoKA is a robust, efficient, and effective PEFT approach for fine-tuning large Transformer models, optimizing both performance and resource consumption.

Abstract: Large pre-trained Transformer models achieve state-of-the-art results across
diverse language and reasoning tasks, but full fine-tuning incurs substantial
storage, memory, and computational overhead. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) methods mitigate these costs by learning only a small subset of
task-specific parameters, yet existing approaches either introduce
inference-time latency (adapter modules), suffer from suboptimal convergence
(randomly initialized low-rank updates), or rely on fixed rank choices that may
not match task complexity (Kronecker-based decompositions).
  We propose SoKA (SVD on Kronecker Adaptation), a novel PEFT strategy that
combines Kronecker-product tensor factorization with SVD-driven initialization
and spectrum-aware dynamic rank selection. Our Kronecker-Product SVD (KPSVD)
procedure extracts principal components of the full weight update into compact
Kronecker factors, while an adaptive rank selection algorithm uses
energy-threshold and elbow-point criteria to prune negligible components.
  Empirical evaluation on LLaMA2-7B across arithmetic reasoning (GSM8K), formal
mathematics (MATH), and code generation (MBPP) demonstrates that SoKA requires
only 0.99M trainable parameters, 25% fewer than LoRA/PiSSA, while matching or
exceeding baseline performance. Moreover, SoKA exhibits faster convergence and
more stable gradients, highlighting its robustness and efficiency for
large-scale model adaptation.

*Bihe Zhao,Pratyush Maini,Franziska Boenisch,Adam Dziedzic*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to enable Dataset Inference (DI) by generating synthetic held-out datasets, addressing the challenge of verifying unauthorized data use in Large Language Model training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is the unauthorized use of large training datasets scraped from the internet without respecting intellectual property rights, and the lack of practical tools for dataset owners to verify such unauthorized usage.

Method: The paper introduces a two-step approach: (1) generating diverse synthetic datasets via a specially-trained generator using a suffix-based completion task, and (2) applying post-hoc calibration to bridge the likelihood gap between real and synthetic datasets for effective DI.

Result: The proposed method successfully enables DI to detect original training sets with high confidence while maintaining low false positive rates across diverse text datasets.

Conclusion: The method provides a reliable and practical solution for dataset owners to verify unauthorized use of their data in LLM training, potentially supporting intellectual property claims in real-world litigation.

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) can be mainly
attributed to their massive training datasets, which are often scraped from the
internet without respecting data owners' intellectual property rights. Dataset
Inference (DI) offers a potential remedy by identifying whether a suspect
dataset was used in training, thereby enabling data owners to verify
unauthorized use. However, existing DI methods require a private set-known to
be absent from training-that closely matches the compromised dataset's
distribution. Such in-distribution, held-out data is rarely available in
practice, severely limiting the applicability of DI. In this work, we address
this challenge by synthetically generating the required held-out set. Our
approach tackles two key obstacles: (1) creating high-quality, diverse
synthetic data that accurately reflects the original distribution, which we
achieve via a data generator trained on a carefully designed suffix-based
completion task, and (2) bridging likelihood gaps between real and synthetic
data, which is realized through post-hoc calibration. Extensive experiments on
diverse text datasets show that using our generated data as a held-out set
enables DI to detect the original training sets with high confidence, while
maintaining a low false positive rate. This result empowers copyright owners to
make legitimate claims on data usage and demonstrates our method's reliability
for real-world litigations. Our code is available at

*Chuan Li,Shunyu Zhao,Vincent Gauthier,Hassine Moungla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DOVA-PATBM is a framework for optimizing EV charging infrastructure deployment, balancing urban, exurban, and rural needs using geo-computational techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the growing demand for EVs, planning scalable and efficient charging infrastructure for diverse geographical contexts is essential.

Method: It combines data like roads and POIs using H3 grid rasterization, GNN for centrality modeling, Voronoi tessellation for charging coverage, and a queueing model with heuristics for site selection.

Result: Applied in Georgia, USA, it boosted coverage by 12%, reduced low-income residents' charger travel distance by half, and ensured transmission headroom compliance.

Conclusion: DOVA-PATBM offers a deployable, computationally tractable solution for equitable and effective EV charging network planning at large scales.

Abstract: The accelerating uptake of battery-electric vehicles demands infrastructure
planning tools that are both data-rich and geographically scalable. Whereas
most prior studies optimise charging locations for single cities, state-wide
and national networks must reconcile the conflicting requirements of dense
metropolitan cores, car-dependent exurbs, and power-constrained rural
corridors.
  We present DOVA-PATBM (Deployment Optimisation with Voronoi-oriented,
Adaptive, POI-Aware Temporal Behaviour Model), a geo-computational framework
that unifies these contexts in a single pipeline. The method rasterises
heterogeneous data (roads, population, night lights, POIs, and feeder lines)
onto a hierarchical H3 grid, infers intersection importance with a
zone-normalised graph neural network centrality model, and overlays a Voronoi
tessellation that guarantees at least one five-port DC fast charger within
every 30 km radius. Hourly arrival profiles, learned from loop-detector and
floating-car traces, feed a finite M/M/c queue to size ports under
feeder-capacity and outage-risk constraints. A greedy maximal-coverage
heuristic with income-weighted penalties then selects the minimum number of
sites that satisfy coverage and equity targets.
  Applied to the State of Georgia, USA, DOVA-PATBM (i) increases 30 km tile
coverage by 12 percentage points, (ii) halves the mean distance that low-income
residents travel to the nearest charger, and (iii) meets sub-transmission
headroom everywhere -- all while remaining computationally tractable for
national-scale roll-outs. These results demonstrate that a tightly integrated,
GNN-driven, multi-resolution approach can bridge the gap between academic
optimisation and deployable infrastructure policy.

TL;DR: The study introduces a generative AI-backed framework to manage credit risk and determine loan sizes for SMEs in cross-border e-commerce using third-party logistics-led supply chain finance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SMEs in cross-border e-commerce face difficulties in securing loans due to limited credit histories, creating a need for innovative credit risk management solutions.

Method: The paper leverages Quantile-Regression-based Generative Metamodeling (QRGMM) integrated with Deep Factorization Machines (DeepFM) to create a framework for risk estimation and loan determination.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world data confirmed the framework’s effectiveness in assessing credit risk and determining appropriate loan sizes.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of applying generative AI in improving credit access for SMEs in cross-border e-commerce, establishing a foundation for better financial practices in this sector.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of cross-border e-commerce (CBEC) has created significant
opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), yet financing
remains a critical challenge due to SMEs' limited credit histories. Third-party
logistics (3PL)-led supply chain finance (SCF) has emerged as a promising
solution, leveraging in-transit inventory as collateral. We propose an advanced
credit risk management framework tailored for 3PL-led SCF, addressing the dual
challenges of credit risk assessment and loan size determination. Specifically,
we leverage conditional generative modeling of sales distributions through
Quantile-Regression-based Generative Metamodeling (QRGMM) as the foundation for
risk estimation. We propose a unified framework that enables flexible
estimation of multiple risk measures while introducing a functional risk
measure formulation that systematically captures the relationship between these
risk measures and varying loan levels, supported by theoretical guarantees. To
capture complex covariate interactions in e-commerce sales data, we integrate
QRGMM with Deep Factorization Machines (DeepFM). Extensive experiments on
synthetic and real-world data validate the efficacy of our model for credit
risk assessment and loan size determination. This study represents a pioneering
application of generative AI in CBEC SCF risk management, offering a solid
foundation for enhanced credit practices and improved SME access to capital.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SecFwT, a framework for privacy-preserving fine-tuning of large language models using secure multi-party computation (MPC), addressing inefficiencies in backward propagation and softmax attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adaptation of large language models (LLMs) in privacy-sensitive domains like healthcare and finance is limited by stringent privacy requirements and lack of accessible training data.

Method: The authors propose SecFwT, which incorporates a forward-only tuning paradigm to eliminate backward propagation and optimizer computations, and introduces MPC-friendly Random Feature Attention to replace softmax-based attention mechanisms.

Result: SecFwT significantly improves efficiency and privacy preservation during LLM fine-tuning, making scalable and secure tuning feasible for sensitive applications.

Conclusion: The framework enables efficient, privacy-preserving fine-tuning of LLMs, overcoming computational challenges and facilitating their use in privacy-critical fields.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed numerous fields, yet their
adaptation to specialized tasks in privacy-sensitive domains, such as
healthcare and finance, is constrained by the scarcity of accessible training
data due to stringent privacy requirements. Secure multi-party computation
(MPC)-based privacy-preserving machine learning offers a powerful approach to
protect both model parameters and user data, but its application to LLMs has
been largely limited to inference, as fine-tuning introduces significant
computational challenges, particularly in privacy-preserving backward
propagation and optimizer operations. This paper identifies two primary
obstacles to MPC-based privacy-preserving fine-tuning of LLMs: (1) the
substantial computational overhead of backward and optimizer processes, and (2)
the inefficiency of softmax-based attention mechanisms in MPC settings. To
address these challenges, we propose SecFwT, the first MPC-based framework
designed for efficient, privacy-preserving LLM fine-tuning. SecFwT introduces a
forward-only tuning paradigm to eliminate backward and optimizer computations
and employs MPC-friendly Random Feature Attention to approximate softmax
attention, significantly reducing costly non-linear operations and
computational complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that SecFwT delivers
substantial improvements in efficiency and privacy preservation, enabling
scalable and secure fine-tuning of LLMs for privacy-critical applications.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a structured active learning method that integrates a sequence-to-sequence variational autoencoder to tackle multi-target drug optimization, demonstrated via coronavirus main proteases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of optimizing molecules for multiple therapeutic targets in drug discovery, made difficult by sparse rewards and conflicting design constraints.

Method: The authors introduce a structured active learning paradigm that incorporates a Seq2Seq variational autoencoder. The method iteratively expands latent space regions for chemical diversity while applying stringent docking thresholds for multi-target affinity.

Result: The approach successfully generated structurally diverse pan-inhibitor candidates for SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV main proteases.

Conclusion: The framework facilitates efficient exploration of beneficial chemical spaces in multi-objective drug design and offers a generalizable strategy for polypharmacological challenges.

Abstract: Simultaneously optimizing molecules against multiple therapeutic targets
remains a profound challenge in drug discovery, particularly due to sparse
rewards and conflicting design constraints. We propose a structured active
learning (AL) paradigm integrating a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) variational
autoencoder (VAE) into iterative loops designed to balance chemical diversity,
molecular quality, and multi-target affinity. Our method alternates between
expanding chemically feasible regions of latent space and progressively
constraining molecules based on increasingly stringent multi-target docking
thresholds. In a proof-of-concept study targeting three related coronavirus
main proteases (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV), our approach efficiently
generated a structurally diverse set of pan-inhibitor candidates. We
demonstrate that careful timing and strategic placement of chemical filters
within this active learning pipeline markedly enhance exploration of beneficial
chemical space, transforming the sparse-reward, multi-objective drug design
problem into an accessible computational task. Our framework thus provides a
generalizable roadmap for efficiently navigating complex polypharmacological
landscapes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates in-context learning with missing labels through analytical exploration of Gaussian mixture models (GMM), revealing that multilayer or looped transformers can effectively process missing data and improve semi-supervised learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to better understand how in-context learning (ICL) manages missing or incorrect labels and to explore its capabilities using a theoretical framework.

Method: The authors provide a theoretical study of binary GMM demonstrations and analyze the ability of both one-layer linear attention models and multilayer/looped transformers in leveraging unlabeled data.

Result: The study finds that one-layer models fail to leverage unlabeled data, whereas multilayer/looped transformers are adept at exploiting such data by implicitly creating sophisticated estimators. This ability ties semi-supervised learning to Expectation Maximization.

Conclusion: Mild depths or looping in transformer models can significantly enhance semi-supervised learning capabilities, which was also validated through experiments on real-world data. Their method outperformed single-pass inference in semi-supervised tabular learning tasks.

Abstract: Recent research shows that in-context learning (ICL) can be effective even
when demonstrations have missing or incorrect labels. To shed light on this
capability, we examine a canonical setting where the demonstrations are drawn
according to a binary Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and a certain fraction of
the demonstrations have missing labels. We provide a comprehensive theoretical
study to show that: (1) The loss landscape of one-layer linear attention models
recover the optimal fully-supervised estimator but completely fail to exploit
unlabeled data; (2) In contrast, multilayer or looped transformers can
effectively leverage unlabeled data by implicitly constructing estimators of
the form $\sum_{i\ge 0} a_i (X^\top X)^iX^\top y$ with $X$ and $y$ denoting
features and partially-observed labels (with missing entries set to zero). We
characterize the class of polynomials that can be expressed as a function of
depth and draw connections to Expectation Maximization, an iterative
pseudo-labeling algorithm commonly used in semi-supervised learning.
Importantly, the leading polynomial power is exponential in depth, so mild
amount of depth/looping suffices. As an application of theory, we propose
looping off-the-shelf tabular foundation models to enhance their
semi-supervision capabilities. Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets
show that our method significantly improves the semisupervised tabular learning
performance over the standard single pass inference.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to predict missing clinical test values using GPT-like embeddings, achieving significant improvements in predictive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enable early diagnoses by predicting abnormal values of non-prescribed tests using data from performed tests.

Method: The method involves formulating the tabular problem as a set translation task between GPT-like embeddings of test labels and values.

Result: The approach improves prediction accuracy by up to 8% AUC for various clinical indicators such as uric acid, glucose, cholesterol, and ferritin.

Conclusion: The approach effectively handles missing data without estimating them directly and integrates the strengths of LLM with clinical tabular datasets.

Abstract: Clinical laboratory results are ubiquitous in any diagnosis making.
Predicting abnormal values of not prescribed tests based on the results of
performed tests looks intriguing, as it would be possible to make early
diagnosis available to everyone. The special place is taken by the Common Blood
Count (CBC) test, as it is the most widely used clinical procedure. Combining
routine biochemical panels with CBC presents a set of test-value pairs that
varies from patient to patient, or, in common settings, a table with missing
values. Here we formulate a tabular modeling problem as a set translation
problem where the source set comprises pairs of GPT-like label column embedding
and its corresponding value while the target set consists of the same type
embeddings only. The proposed approach can effectively deal with missing values
without implicitly estimating them and bridges the world of LLM with the
tabular domain. Applying this method to clinical laboratory data, we achieve an
improvement up to 8% AUC for joint predictions of high uric acid, glucose,

### [202] [Knowledge Distillation Framework for Accelerating High-Accuracy Neural Network-Based Molecular Dynamics Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15337)
*Naoki Matsumura,Yuta Yoshimoto,Yuto Iwasaki,Meguru Yamazaki,Yasufumi Sakai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel knowledge distillation (KD) framework for neural network potentials (NNPs) that reduces the need for expensive density functional theory (DFT) calculations by 10x while maintaining accuracy in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper is to overcome limitations of traditional KD methods for NNPs, which often struggle to generate training data with high-energy structures necessary for stable MD simulations, due to their fine-tuning process increasing energy barriers.

Method: The proposed method employs a two-stage process: using an off-the-shelf, non-fine-tuned pre-trained NNP to generate an initial training dataset, and then fine-tuning the student NNP with a smaller, high-accuracy dataset obtained from DFT calculations.

Result: The framework demonstrated comparable or superior accuracy in reproducing physical properties of both organic and inorganic materials and significantly reduced the need for expensive DFT calculations (10x fewer) compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: This new KD framework for NNPs represents a cost-efficient and accurate approach for MD simulations, enabling the exploration of high-energy structures without additional computational expenses, making it impactful for material property evaluations.

Abstract: Neural network potentials (NNPs) offer a powerful alternative to traditional
force fields for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Accurate and stable MD
simulations, crucial for evaluating material properties, require training data
encompassing both low-energy stable structures and high-energy structures.
Conventional knowledge distillation (KD) methods fine-tune a pre-trained NNP as
a teacher model to generate training data for a student model. However, in
material-specific models, this fine-tuning process increases energy barriers,
making it difficult to create training data containing high-energy structures.
To address this, we propose a novel KD framework that leverages a
non-fine-tuned, off-the-shelf pre-trained NNP as a teacher. Its gentler energy
landscape facilitates the exploration of a wider range of structures, including
the high-energy structures crucial for stable MD simulations. Our framework
employs a two-stage training process: first, the student NNP is trained with a
dataset generated by the off-the-shelf teacher; then, it is fine-tuned with a
smaller, high-accuracy density functional theory (DFT) dataset. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our framework by applying it to both organic (polyethylene
glycol) and inorganic (L$_{10}$GeP$_{2}$S$_{12}$) materials, achieving
comparable or superior accuracy in reproducing physical properties compared to
existing methods. Importantly, our method reduces the number of expensive DFT
calculations by 10x compared to existing NNP generation methods, without
sacrificing accuracy.

### [203] [Acoustic Waveform Inversion with Image-to-Image Schrödinger Bridges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15346)
*A. S. Stankevich,I. B. Petrov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method using conditional Schrödinger Bridges for high-resolution velocity model reconstruction in Full Waveform Inversion (FWI), outperforming existing diffusion model methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning-based Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) techniques struggle with sampling limitations in diffusion models and integrating approximate velocity models efficiently into inversion schemes. The paper aims to address these challenges.

Method: The authors propose a conditional Image-to-Image Schrödinger Bridge (cI2SB) framework, facilitating the interpolation between ground truth and smoothed velocity models using nonlinear drifts.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates superior performance compared to reimplemented conditional diffusion models and supervised learning approaches, requiring fewer neural function evaluations (NFEs).

Conclusion: The cI2SB framework provides an advanced, efficient means of reconstructing velocity models in seismic inversions, showcasing improved fidelity and practical performance benefits.

Abstract: Recent developments in application of deep learning models to acoustic Full
Waveform Inversion (FWI) are marked by the use of diffusion models as prior
distributions for Bayesian-like inference procedures. The advantage of these
methods is the ability to generate high-resolution samples, which are otherwise
unattainable with classical inversion methods or other deep learning-based
solutions. However, the iterative and stochastic nature of sampling from
diffusion models along with heuristic nature of output control remain limiting
factors for their applicability. For instance, an optimal way to include the
approximate velocity model into diffusion-based inversion scheme remains
unclear, even though it is considered an essential part of FWI pipeline. We
address the issue by employing a Schr\"odinger Bridge that interpolates between
the distributions of ground truth and smoothed velocity models. To facilitate
the learning of nonlinear drifts that transfer samples between distributions we
extend the concept of Image-to-Image Schr\"odinger Bridge
($\text{I}^2\text{SB}$) to conditional sampling, resulting in a conditional
Image-to-Image Schr\"odinger Bridge (c$\text{I}^2\text{SB}$) framework. To
validate our method, we assess its effectiveness in reconstructing the
reference velocity model from its smoothed approximation, coupled with the
observed seismic signal of fixed shape. Our experiments demonstrate that the
proposed solution outperforms our reimplementation of conditional diffusion
model suggested in earlier works, while requiring only a few neural function
evaluations (NFEs) to achieve sample fidelity superior to that attained with
supervised learning-based approach. The supplementary code implementing the
algorithms described in this paper can be found in the repository

### [204] [Enhancing One-run Privacy Auditing with Quantile Regression-Based Membership Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15349)
*Terrance Liu,Matteo Boglioni,Yiwei Fu,Shengyuan Hu,Pratiksha Thaker,Zhiwei Steven Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper improves the efficacy of auditing Differential Privacy mechanisms, specifically for black-box scenarios, by introducing a stronger membership inference attack technique that remains computationally efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DP auditing techniques either require high computational resources or provide loose empirical bounds in black-box settings. Enhancing auditing in black-box contexts, where only model outputs are accessible, is critical for practical applications.

Method: The authors propose incorporating quantile regression-based membership inference attacks into one-run DP auditing methods to improve the quality of privacy guarantees achieved in black-box settings.

Result: The proposed method is evaluated on DP-SGD using CIFAR-10 image classification tasks, showing tighter privacy bounds compared to prior black-box auditing techniques while preserving computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Stronger membership inference attacks can bridge the gap between empirical and theoretical privacy bounds, making one-run methods practical and more robust in black-box auditing.

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) auditing aims to provide empirical lower bounds on
the privacy guarantees of DP mechanisms like DP-SGD. While some existing
techniques require many training runs that are prohibitively costly, recent
work introduces one-run auditing approaches that effectively audit DP-SGD in
white-box settings while still being computationally efficient. However, in the
more practical black-box setting where gradients cannot be manipulated during
training and only the last model iterate is observed, prior work shows that
there is still a large gap between the empirical lower bounds and theoretical
upper bounds. Consequently, in this work, we study how incorporating approaches
for stronger membership inference attacks (MIA) can improve one-run auditing in
the black-box setting. Evaluating on image classification models trained on
CIFAR-10 with DP-SGD, we demonstrate that our proposed approach, which utilizes
quantile regression for MIA, achieves tighter bounds while crucially
maintaining the computational efficiency of one-run methods.

*J. Thorben Frank,Winfried Ripken,Gregor Lied,Klaus-Robert Müller,Oliver T. Unke,Stefan Chmiela*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes DiTMC, a framework that enhances Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) for molecular conformer generation, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DiTs have shown strong generative capabilities in image synthesis, but applying them to molecular conformer generation is challenging due to combining discrete molecular graphs with continuous 3D geometry, managing Euclidean symmetries, and designing scalable conditioning mechanisms.

Method: The authors introduce DiTMC, a modular framework that decouples 3D coordinate processing from molecular connectivity conditioning. It incorporates two graph-based conditioning methods and combines non-equivariant and SO(3)-equivariant attention mechanisms to balance accuracy and efficiency.

Result: DiTMC demonstrates state-of-the-art precision and physical validity in standard molecular conformer generation benchmarks, including GEOM-QM9, -DRUGS, and -XL.

Conclusion: The study showcases how architectural decisions and symmetry considerations impact generative modeling quality and efficiency, paving the way for scalable models in molecular structure generation.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated strong performance in
generative modeling, particularly in image synthesis, making them a compelling
choice for molecular conformer generation. However, applying DiTs to molecules
introduces novel challenges, such as integrating discrete molecular graph
information with continuous 3D geometry, handling Euclidean symmetries, and
designing conditioning mechanisms that generalize across molecules of varying
sizes and structures. We propose DiTMC, a framework that adapts DiTs to address
these challenges through a modular architecture that separates the processing
of 3D coordinates from conditioning on atomic connectivity. To this end, we
introduce two complementary graph-based conditioning strategies that integrate
seamlessly with the DiT architecture. These are combined with different
attention mechanisms, including both standard non-equivariant and
SO(3)-equivariant formulations, enabling flexible control over the trade-off
between between accuracy and computational efficiency. Experiments on standard
conformer generation benchmarks (GEOM-QM9, -DRUGS, -XL) demonstrate that DiTMC
achieves state-of-the-art precision and physical validity. Our results
highlight how architectural choices and symmetry priors affect sample quality
and efficiency, suggesting promising directions for large-scale generative
modeling of molecular structures. Code available at

*Damin Kühn,Michael T. Schaub*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel ground metric learning approach for optimal transport, avoiding the limitations of predefined and supervised metrics, and demonstrates improved performance in tasks like clustering and classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predefined metrics cannot account for feature variations and supervised approaches lack generalization across classes. There was a need for a method to learn ground metrics for distributions over a shared space.

Method: The proposed method learns global metrics using only distribution-level class labels, providing a pointwise distance while operating over arbitrary distributions within a shared metric space.

Result: The global learned metric improves optimal transport distances, enhancing performance in embedding, clustering, and classification.

Conclusion: The approach is effective and interpretable, as demonstrated on scRNA-seq patient data from various diseases, suggesting broad applicability.

Abstract: Optimal transport provides a robust framework for comparing probability
distributions. Its effectiveness is significantly influenced by the choice of
the underlying ground metric. Traditionally, the ground metric has either been
(i) predefined, e.g., as the Euclidean distance, or (ii) learned in a
supervised way, by utilizing labeled data to learn a suitable ground metric for
enhanced task-specific performance. Yet, predefined metrics typically cannot
account for the inherent structure and varying importance of different features
in the data, and existing supervised approaches to ground metric learning often
do not generalize across multiple classes or are restricted to distributions
with shared supports. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach
for learning metrics for arbitrary distributions over a shared metric space.
Our method provides a distance between individual points like a global metric,
but requires only class labels on a distribution-level for training. The
learned global ground metric enables more accurate optimal transport distances,
leading to improved performance in embedding, clustering and classification
tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of our approach
using patient-level scRNA-seq data spanning multiple diseases.

*Riccardo De Santi,Marin Vlastelica,Ya-Ping Hsieh,Zebang Shen,Niao He,Andreas Krause*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel exploratory framework using pre-trained diffusion models, emphasizing entropy maximization for generating innovative designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need for improved exploration strategies in real-world decision-making, focusing on generating novel designs beyond existing data distributions.

Method: A pre-trained diffusion model is utilized to cast exploration as entropy maximization over the data manifold, using a mirror descent algorithm for sequential fine-tuning.

Result: The approach showed promising empirical results, particularly in synthetic and high-dimensional text-to-image diffusion tasks, validating the method's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The framework provides a scalable and effective solution for exploration, leveraging the representational power of diffusion models without relying on explicit uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Exploration is critical for solving real-world decision-making problems such
as scientific discovery, where the objective is to generate truly novel designs
rather than mimic existing data distributions. In this work, we address the
challenge of leveraging the representational power of generative models for
exploration without relying on explicit uncertainty quantification. We
introduce a novel framework that casts exploration as entropy maximization over
the approximate data manifold implicitly defined by a pre-trained diffusion
model. Then, we present a novel principle for exploration based on density
estimation, a problem well-known to be challenging in practice. To overcome
this issue and render this method truly scalable, we leverage a fundamental
connection between the entropy of the density induced by a diffusion model and
its score function. Building on this, we develop an algorithm based on mirror
descent that solves the exploration problem as sequential fine-tuning of a
pre-trained diffusion model. We prove its convergence to the optimal
exploratory diffusion model under realistic assumptions by leveraging recent
understanding of mirror flows. Finally, we empirically evaluate our approach on
both synthetic and high-dimensional text-to-image diffusion, demonstrating
promising results.

*Sepehr Elahi,Paula Mürmann,Patrick Thiran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses optimal vaccination strategies in SIS models on unknown graphs, introducing algorithms for graph learning and effective vaccination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To minimize the extinction time of infectious outbreaks in scenarios where the underlying graph structure is unknown.

Method: The paper proposes a graph learning algorithm with established sample complexity and develops polynomial and heuristic approaches to solve the vaccination problem.

Result: The algorithms demonstrate promising performance in recovering graphs and optimizing vaccination strategies, validated through synthetic and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: The study advances methods for controlling infectious outbreaks by addressing unknown graph structures and providing computational strategies for effective interventions.

Abstract: The Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model is a widely used model for
the spread of information and infectious diseases, particularly non-immunizing
ones, on a graph. Given a highly contagious disease, a natural question is how
to best vaccinate individuals to minimize the disease's extinction time. While
previous works showed that the problem of optimal vaccination is closely linked
to the NP-hard Spectral Radius Minimization (SRM) problem, they assumed that
the graph is known, which is often not the case in practice. In this work, we
consider the problem of minimizing the extinction time of an outbreak modeled
by an SIS model where the graph on which the disease spreads is unknown and
only the infection states of the vertices are observed. To this end, we split
the problem into two: learning the graph and determining effective vaccination
strategies. We propose a novel inclusion-exclusion-based learning algorithm
and, unlike previous approaches, establish its sample complexity for graph
recovery. We then detail an optimal algorithm for the SRM problem and prove
that its running time is polynomial in the number of vertices for graphs with
bounded treewidth. This is complemented by an efficient and effective
polynomial-time greedy heuristic for any graph. Finally, we present experiments
on synthetic and real-world data that numerically validate our learning and
vaccination algorithms.

*David Dembinsky,Adriano Lucieri,Stanislav Frolov,Hiba Najjar,Ko Watanabe,Andreas Dengel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the lack of standardized evaluation protocols for Explainable AI (XAI) by introducing a unified framework (VXAI) based on a systematic review of 362 publications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to improve trustworthiness in AI systems by ensuring human-understandable explanations are rigorously evaluated.

Method: A systematic literature review was conducted based on PRISMA guidelines, identifying 362 publications and grouping metrics into 41 categories.

Result: The study proposed a unified VXAI framework with a three-dimensional categorization scheme, providing a structured overview and functional metric grouping.

Conclusion: The VXAI framework promotes systematic metric selection, comparability across methods, and serves as a foundation for extending XAI evaluation standards.

Abstract: Modern AI systems frequently rely on opaque black-box models, most notably
Deep Neural Networks, whose performance stems from complex architectures with
millions of learned parameters. While powerful, their complexity poses a major
challenge to trustworthiness, particularly due to a lack of transparency.
Explainable AI (XAI) addresses this issue by providing human-understandable
explanations of model behavior. However, to ensure their usefulness and
trustworthiness, such explanations must be rigorously evaluated. Despite the
growing number of XAI methods, the field lacks standardized evaluation
protocols and consensus on appropriate metrics. To address this gap, we conduct
a systematic literature review following the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and introduce a
unified framework for the eValuation of XAI (VXAI). We identify 362 relevant
publications and aggregate their contributions into 41 functionally similar
metric groups. In addition, we propose a three-dimensional categorization
scheme spanning explanation type, evaluation contextuality, and explanation
quality desiderata. Our framework provides the most comprehensive and
structured overview of VXAI to date. It supports systematic metric selection,
promotes comparability across methods, and offers a flexible foundation for
future extensions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper surveys reward modeling techniques in deep reinforcement learning, categorizing approaches and discussing applications and evaluation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a systematic review of reward models, which are vital for guiding RL policy optimization.

Method: Comprehensive literature review and categorization of reward modeling approaches based on source, mechanism, and learning paradigm.

Result: Key insights into established and emerging reward modeling methods, applications, and evaluation strategies.

Conclusion: Provides a structured overview of the field, suggesting future research directions in reward modeling.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), agents continually interact with the
environment and use the feedback to refine their behavior. To guide policy
optimization, reward models are introduced as proxies of the desired
objectives, such that when the agent maximizes the accumulated reward, it also
fulfills the task designer's intentions. Recently, significant attention from
both academic and industrial researchers has focused on developing reward
models that not only align closely with the true objectives but also facilitate
policy optimization. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of
reward modeling techniques within the deep RL literature. We begin by outlining
the background and preliminaries in reward modeling. Next, we present an
overview of recent reward modeling approaches, categorizing them based on the
source, the mechanism, and the learning paradigm. Building on this
understanding, we discuss various applications of these reward modeling
techniques and review methods for evaluating reward models. Finally, we
conclude by highlighting promising research directions in reward modeling.
Altogether, this survey includes both established and emerging methods, filling
the vacancy of a systematic review of reward models in current literature.

*Scott Jeen,Tom Bewley,Jonathan M. Cullen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines the impact of partial observability on zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) methods and introduces memory-based architectures as a solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zero-shot RL methods have shown promise in handling unseen tasks but often rely on the assumption of fully observable Markov states, which is impractical in real-world scenarios.

Method: The authors evaluate memory-based architectures for zero-shot RL in environments with partial observability of states, rewards, and dynamics.

Result: Memory-based architectures demonstrate improved performance compared to memory-free baselines in areas with partial observability.

Conclusion: Memory usage enhances zero-shot RL methods for handling partially observable environments, addressing limitations of prior approaches.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that, under certain assumptions, zero-shot
reinforcement learning (RL) methods can generalise to any unseen task in an
environment after reward-free pre-training. Access to Markov states is one such
assumption, yet, in many real-world applications, the Markov state is only
partially observable. Here, we explore how the performance of standard
zero-shot RL methods degrades when subjected to partially observability, and
show that, as in single-task RL, memory-based architectures are an effective
remedy. We evaluate our memory-based zero-shot RL methods in domains where the
states, rewards and a change in dynamics are partially observed, and show
improved performance over memory-free baselines. Our code is open-sourced via:

### [212] [Semi-supervised Graph Anomaly Detection via Robust Homophily Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15448)
*Guoguo Ai,Hezhe Qiao,Hui Yan,Guansong Pang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes RHO, a method for semi-supervised graph anomaly detection that improves homophily pattern learning for robust anomaly detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current semi-supervised graph anomaly detection methods assume normal nodes exhibit consistent homophily, but this isn't realistic as normal nodes often have diverse homophily patterns.

Method: The paper introduces RHO, comprising two modules: adaptive frequency response filters (AdaFreq) to capture homophily patterns, and graph normality alignment (GNA) to ensure consistency between different homophily perspectives.

Result: Experimental evaluation on eight real-world datasets demonstrates that RHO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in learning diverse homophily patterns and detecting anomalies.

Conclusion: RHO effectively addresses the limitations of existing semi-supervised GAD approaches by robustly learning diverse homophily patterns, thereby improving anomaly detection accuracy.

Abstract: Semi-supervised graph anomaly detection (GAD) utilizes a small set of labeled
normal nodes to identify abnormal nodes from a large set of unlabeled nodes in
a graph. Current methods in this line posit that 1) normal nodes share a
similar level of homophily and 2) the labeled normal nodes can well represent
the homophily patterns in the normal class. However, this assumption often does
not hold well since normal nodes in a graph can exhibit diverse homophily in
real-world GAD datasets. In this paper, we propose RHO, namely Robust Homophily
Learning, to adaptively learn such homophily patterns. RHO consists of two
novel modules, adaptive frequency response filters (AdaFreq) and graph
normality alignment (GNA). AdaFreq learns a set of adaptive spectral filters
that capture different frequency components of the labeled normal nodes with
varying homophily in the channel-wise and cross-channel views of node
attributes. GNA is introduced to enforce consistency between the channel-wise
and cross-channel homophily representations to robustify the normality learned
by the filters in the two views. Experiments on eight real-world GAD datasets
show that RHO can effectively learn varying, often under-represented, homophily
in the small normal node set and substantially outperforms state-of-the-art
competing methods. Code is available at https://github.com/mala-lab/RHO.

*Laura Kopf,Nils Feldhus,Kirill Bykov,Philine Lou Bommer,Anna Hedström,Marina M. -C. Höhne,Oliver Eberle*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PRISM is a new framework designed to produce nuanced and accurate descriptions of neural network features by addressing challenges in robustness and polysemanticity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for understanding neural network features are limited because they assume each neuron encodes a single concept and lack robustness, which restricts the ability to capture model behaviors.

Method: The paper introduces PRISM, a framework that generates nuanced descriptions of neural network features, accounting for polysemanticity by providing more expressive and faithful descriptions.

Result: PRISM improves feature description quality and captures distinct concepts better than existing methods, as evaluated through benchmarking on language models.

Conclusion: PRISM enhances our understanding of neural network behavior by addressing polysemanticity and improving the accuracy of feature descriptions compared to prior methods.

Abstract: Automated interpretability research aims to identify concepts encoded in
neural network features to enhance human understanding of model behavior.
Current feature description methods face two critical challenges: limited
robustness and the flawed assumption that each neuron encodes only a single
concept (monosemanticity), despite growing evidence that neurons are often
polysemantic. This assumption restricts the expressiveness of feature
descriptions and limits their ability to capture the full range of behaviors
encoded in model internals. To address this, we introduce Polysemantic FeatuRe
Identification and Scoring Method (PRISM), a novel framework that captures the
inherent complexity of neural network features. Unlike prior approaches that
assign a single description per feature, PRISM provides more nuanced
descriptions for both polysemantic and monosemantic features. We apply PRISM to
language models and, through extensive benchmarking against existing methods,
demonstrate that our approach produces more accurate and faithful feature
descriptions, improving both overall description quality (via a description
score) and the ability to capture distinct concepts when polysemanticity is
present (via a polysemanticity score).

*Artur André Oliveira,Mateus Espadoto,Roberto Hirata Jr.,Roberto M. Cesar Jr.,Alex C. Telea*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel user-guided framework for creating interpretable visualizations of high-dimensional data using natural-language prompts and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dimensionality reduction (DR) methods fail to incorporate semantic structures beyond available variables or class labels, limiting their interpretability and flexibility.

Method: The approach uses zero-shot classification with MLLMs and allows users to dynamically guide projections via natural-language prompts, enabling the exploration of high-level semantic relationships in data.

Result: The method improves cluster separation across datasets and transforms DR into an interactive, user-driven process.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges automated DR methods and human-centered data exploration by providing customizable and adaptive data visualizations.

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques map high-dimensional data into
lower-dimensional spaces. Yet, current DR techniques are not designed to
explore semantic structure that is not directly available in the form of
variables or class labels. We introduce a novel user-guided projection
framework for image and text data that enables customizable, interpretable,
data visualizations via zero-shot classification with Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs). We enable users to steer projections dynamically via
natural-language guiding prompts, to specify high-level semantic relationships
of interest to the users which are not explicitly present in the data
dimensions. We evaluate our method across several datasets and show that it not
only enhances cluster separation, but also transforms DR into an interactive,
user-driven process. Our approach bridges the gap between fully automated DR
techniques and human-centered data exploration, offering a flexible and
adaptive way to tailor projections to specific analytical needs.

*Gabrel J. Perin,Runjin Chen,Xuxi Chen,Nina S. T. Hirata,Zhangyang Wang,Junyuan Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a training-free method named Low-Rank Extrapolation (LoX) to enhance the safety robustness of aligned large language models (LLMs) against both benign and malicious fine-tuning attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the safety vulnerabilities of LLMs, where their alignment can be undermined by seemingly harmless fine-tuning, posing risks in real-world applications.

Method: The proposed method, Low-Rank Extrapolation (LoX), enhances the robustness of LLMs' safety subspaces by extrapolating safety-critical parameters to make them less sensitive to perturbations.

Result: Experimental results show that LoX reduces attack success rates by 11% to 54% across benign and malicious fine-tuning while maintaining the model's adaptability to new tasks.

Conclusion: LoX provides an effective, training-free mechanism to improve the safety of LLMs by making their parameters less susceptible to attack-related perturbations, enhancing robustness without sacrificing task performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable in real-world
applications. However, their widespread adoption raises significant safety
concerns, particularly in responding to socially harmful questions. Despite
substantial efforts to improve model safety through alignment, aligned models
can still have their safety protections undermined by subsequent fine-tuning -
even when the additional training data appears benign. In this paper, we
empirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from the sensitivity of
safety-critical low-rank subspaces in LLM parameters to fine-tuning. Building
on this insight, we propose a novel training-free method, termed Low-Rank
Extrapolation (LoX), to enhance safety robustness by extrapolating the safety
subspace of an aligned LLM. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness
of LoX, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against both
benign and malicious fine-tuning attacks while preserving the model's
adaptability to new tasks. For instance, LoX leads to 11% to 54% absolute
reductions in attack success rates (ASR) facing benign or malicious fine-tuning
attacks. By investigating the ASR landscape of parameters, we attribute the
success of LoX to that the extrapolation moves LLM parameters to a flatter
zone, thereby less sensitive to perturbations. The code is available at

*Tevin Wang,Chenyan Xiong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AutoRule introduces an automated method to extract rules from user preferences for reinforcement learning, showing significant improvements in policy optimization and reduced reward hacking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) by automating the creation of rule-based rewards, avoiding the manual effort involved in rule engineering.

Method: AutoRule uses a reasoning model to interpret preferences, identifies rules from reasoning chains, synthesizes them into a rule set, and integrates these rules with language-model verifiers for auxiliary rewards.

Result: The AutoRule-enhanced Llama-3-8B model achieved a 28.6% improvement in length-controlled win rates and a 6.1% boost in second-turn performance on different benchmarks.

Conclusion: AutoRule successfully automates rule extraction for reinforcement learning, aligns well with dataset preferences, reduces reward hacking, and highlights unique dataset-specific qualities.

Abstract: Rule-based rewards offer a promising strategy for improving reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF), but current approaches often rely on
manual rule engineering. We present AutoRule, a fully automated method for
extracting rules from preference feedback and formulating them into rule-based
rewards. AutoRule extraction operates in three stages: it leverages a reasoning
model to interpret user preferences, identifies candidate rules from the
reasoning chain of these interpretations, and synthesizes them into a unified
rule set. Leveraging the finalized rule set, we employ language-model verifiers
to compute the fraction of rules satisfied by each output, using this metric as
an auxiliary reward alongside the learned reward model during policy
optimization. Training a Llama-3-8B model with AutoRule results in a 28.6\%
relative improvement in length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval2.0, and a
6.1\% relative gain in second-turn performance on a held-out MT-Bench subset,
compared to a GRPO baseline trained with the same learned reward model but
without the rule-based auxiliary reward. Our analysis confirms that the
extracted rules exhibit good agreement with dataset preference. We find that
AutoRule demonstrates reduced reward hacking compared to a learned reward model
when run over two episodes. Finally, our case study suggests that the extracted

*Alaa Anani,Tobias Lorenz,Mario Fritz,Bernt Schiele*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a certification framework for ensuring the robustness of black-box post-hoc attribution methods against input perturbations using randomized smoothing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vulnerability of existing attribution methods, which are highly non-robust to minor input perturbations, compromising trustworthiness.

Method: The authors utilize randomized smoothing to sparsify and smooth attribution maps, reformulating the task as a segmentation problem and certifying pixel importance against $\ell_2$-bounded perturbations.

Result: The framework is evaluated across 12 attribution methods and 5 ImageNet models, demonstrating robust, interpretable, and faithful attribution maps.

Conclusion: The proposed certification framework enhances the reliability and robustness of attribution methods, facilitating their use in critical downstream tasks.

Abstract: Post-hoc attribution methods aim to explain deep learning predictions by
highlighting influential input pixels. However, these explanations are highly
non-robust: small, imperceptible input perturbations can drastically alter the
attribution map while maintaining the same prediction. This vulnerability
undermines their trustworthiness and calls for rigorous robustness guarantees
of pixel-level attribution scores. We introduce the first certification
framework that guarantees pixel-level robustness for any black-box attribution
method using randomized smoothing. By sparsifying and smoothing attribution
maps, we reformulate the task as a segmentation problem and certify each
pixel's importance against $\ell_2$-bounded perturbations. We further propose
three evaluation metrics to assess certified robustness, localization, and
faithfulness. An extensive evaluation of 12 attribution methods across 5
ImageNet models shows that our certified attributions are robust,
interpretable, and faithful, enabling reliable use in downstream tasks. Our
code is at https://github.com/AlaaAnani/certified-attributions.

### [219] [Dense SAE Latents Are Features, Not Bugs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15679)
*Xiaoqing Sun,Alessandro Stolfo,Joshua Engels,Ben Wu,Senthooran Rajamanoharan,Mrinmaya Sachan,Max Tegmark*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates dense latents in sparse autoencoders for language models, showing they are meaningful and functional, not mere artifacts of training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the nature of dense latents in sparse autoencoders, questioning whether they are undesirable artifacts or meaningful representations.

Method: The study uses systematic investigation of dense latents' geometry, function, origin, and evolution across layers. It introduces a taxonomy and analyzes roles of dense features.

Result: Dense latents persist and often reflect meaningful representations tied to functions like position tracking, context binding, and semantic processing. They evolve structurally and semantically.

Conclusion: Dense latents are integral to language model computations and should not be disregarded as training noise but rather seen as functional components.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are designed to extract interpretable features
from language models by enforcing a sparsity constraint. Ideally, training an
SAE would yield latents that are both sparse and semantically meaningful.
However, many SAE latents activate frequently (i.e., are \emph{dense}), raising
concerns that they may be undesirable artifacts of the training procedure. In
this work, we systematically investigate the geometry, function, and origin of
dense latents and show that they are not only persistent but often reflect
meaningful model representations. We first demonstrate that dense latents tend
to form antipodal pairs that reconstruct specific directions in the residual
stream, and that ablating their subspace suppresses the emergence of new dense
features in retrained SAEs -- suggesting that high density features are an
intrinsic property of the residual space. We then introduce a taxonomy of dense
latents, identifying classes tied to position tracking, context binding,
entropy regulation, letter-specific output signals, part-of-speech, and
principal component reconstruction. Finally, we analyze how these features
evolve across layers, revealing a shift from structural features in early
layers, to semantic features in mid layers, and finally to output-oriented
signals in the last layers of the model. Our findings indicate that dense
latents serve functional roles in language model computation and should not be
dismissed as training noise.

### [220] [Over-squashing in Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15507)
*Ivan Marisca,Jacob Bamberger,Cesare Alippi,Michael M. Bronstein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper formalizes and examines the over-squashing issue in Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs), highlighting its unique challenges compared to static GNNs and offering insights for improved architectural design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the lack of study on the over-squashing problem in STGNNs, despite its prominence in static GNNs and its amplified effects due to added temporal complexity.

Method: The study formalizes the concept of spatiotemporal over-squashing, analyzes its characteristics, and proves that both time-and-space and time-then-space paradigms are affected equally. Validation is performed using synthetic and real-world datasets.

Result: The authors reveal that STGNN convolutional architectures paradoxically favor long-term temporal propagation over short-term and verify the universality of over-squashing effects across computational paradigms.

Conclusion: The findings provide theoretical and empirical evidence for the spatiotemporal over-squashing phenomenon, guiding the development of more effective STGNN designs with improved information propagation.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across various
domains. However, recent theoretical advances have identified fundamental
limitations in their information propagation capabilities, such as
over-squashing, where distant nodes fail to effectively exchange information.
While extensively studied in static contexts, this issue remains unexplored in
Spatiotemporal GNNs (STGNNs), which process sequences associated with graph
nodes. Nonetheless, the temporal dimension amplifies this challenge by
increasing the information that must be propagated. In this work, we formalize
the spatiotemporal over-squashing problem and demonstrate its distinct
characteristics compared to the static case. Our analysis reveals that
counterintuitively, convolutional STGNNs favor information propagation from
points temporally distant rather than close in time. Moreover, we prove that
architectures that follow either time-and-space or time-then-space processing
paradigms are equally affected by this phenomenon, providing theoretical
justification for computationally efficient implementations. We validate our
findings on synthetic and real-world datasets, providing deeper insights into
their operational dynamics and principled guidance for more effective designs.

### [221] [RePCS: Diagnosing Data Memorization in LLM-Powered Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15513)
*Le Vu Anh,Nguyen Viet Anh,Mehmet Dik,Luong Van Nghia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Retrieval-Path Contamination Scoring (RePCS)', a method for detecting when retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models rely on memorized data instead of retrieved evidence, using KL divergence as a metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of contamination in RAG systems, where models produce outputs based on memorized training data rather than the retrieved relevant external information.

Method: RePCS operates by comparing the divergence in output distributions between two inference paths (parametric path vs retrieval-augmented path) utilizing the KL divergence metric. This approach is model-agnostic, lightweight, and requires only a single additional forward pass.

Result: On the Prompt-WNQA benchmark, RePCS achieves a ROC-AUC of 0.918, outperforming previous methods by 6.5 percentage points while introducing a latency overhead of less than 4.7%.

Conclusion: RePCS offers an efficient and robust way to detect contamination in RAG systems, ensuring they leverage retrieval correctly, and is particularly useful for applications where safety is critical.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a common strategy for
updating large language model (LLM) responses with current, external
information. However, models may still rely on memorized training data, bypass
the retrieved evidence, and produce contaminated outputs. We introduce
Retrieval-Path Contamination Scoring (RePCS), a diagnostic method that detects
such behavior without requiring model access or retraining. RePCS compares two
inference paths: (i) a parametric path using only the query, and (ii) a
retrieval-augmented path using both the query and retrieved context by
computing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between their output
distributions. A low divergence suggests that the retrieved context had minimal
impact, indicating potential memorization. This procedure is model-agnostic,
requires no gradient or internal state access, and adds only a single
additional forward pass. We further derive PAC-style guarantees that link the
KL threshold to user-defined false positive and false negative rates. On the
Prompt-WNQA benchmark, RePCS achieves a ROC-AUC of 0.918. This result
outperforms the strongest prior method by 6.5 percentage points while keeping
latency overhead below 4.7% on an NVIDIA T4 GPU. RePCS offers a lightweight,
black-box safeguard to verify whether a RAG system meaningfully leverages
retrieval, making it especially valuable in safety-critical applications.

*Hristo Papazov,Nicolas Flammarion*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper extends Gold's framework for learning computable functions in the limit by introducing Time-Bound and Policy-Trajectory Observations to tackle practical constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing frameworks for learning computable functions do not account for computational constraints and realistic input sources, limiting applicability.

Method: The authors propose new observation paradigms: Time-Bound Observations and Policy-Trajectory Observations, alongside computational complexity constraints, to enhance learnability within Gold's framework.

Result: Learning barriers for general recursive functions were overcome using approximate time-bound observations and computational agent observations, linking this to finite-state transducer inference.

Conclusion: While this extended framework advances function learnability, it highlights limitations like the absence of computable characteristic sets for linear-time computable functions under specific conditions.

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of learning computable functions in the limit
by extending Gold's inductive inference framework to incorporate
\textit{computational observations} and \textit{restricted input sources}.
Complimentary to the traditional Input-Output Observations, we introduce
Time-Bound Observations, and Policy-Trajectory Observations to study the
learnability of general recursive functions under more realistic constraints.
While input-output observations do not suffice for learning the class of
general recursive functions in the limit, we overcome this learning barrier by
imposing computational complexity constraints or supplementing with approximate
time-bound observations. Further, we build a formal framework around
observations of \textit{computational agents} and show that learning computable
functions from policy trajectories reduces to learning rational functions from
input and output, thereby revealing interesting connections to finite-state
transducer inference. On the negative side, we show that computable or
polynomial-mass characteristic sets cannot exist for the class of linear-time
computable functions even for policy-trajectory observations.

TL;DR: The paper identifies root causes of degraded scaling performance in deep reinforcement learning networks and proposes simple solutions to stabilize them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of scaling deep reinforcement learning networks, which often leads to degraded performance without clear understanding of the causes.

Method: Conduct empirical analyses to identify root causes of scaling issues, followed by direct interventions to stabilize gradient flow in network architectures.

Result: The proposed interventions lead to robust performance across various network depths and widths, and validate their effectiveness across different agents and environments.

Conclusion: The paper provides simple, compatible mechanisms to enable scalable and strong performance in deep reinforcement learning networks by addressing non-stationarity and gradient pathologies.

Abstract: Scaling deep reinforcement learning networks is challenging and often results
in degraded performance, yet the root causes of this failure mode remain poorly
understood. Several recent works have proposed mechanisms to address this, but
they are often complex and fail to highlight the causes underlying this
difficulty. In this work, we conduct a series of empirical analyses which
suggest that the combination of non-stationarity with gradient pathologies, due
to suboptimal architectural choices, underlie the challenges of scale. We
propose a series of direct interventions that stabilize gradient flow, enabling
robust performance across a range of network depths and widths. Our
interventions are simple to implement and compatible with well-established
algorithms, and result in an effective mechanism that enables strong
performance even at large scales. We validate our findings on a variety of
agents and suites of environments.

*Akhil Singampalli,Danish Gufran,Sudeep Pasricha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DAILOC improves indoor localization using Wi-Fi fingerprints by adapting to both device and temporal variations, offering lower errors than current state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to address domain shifts in Wi-Fi-based indoor localization caused by device heterogeneity and temporal changes, which result in poor generalization and forgetting over time.

Method: DAILOC uses a multi-level variational autoencoder to disentangle domain shifts from location features and applies a memory-guided class latent alignment mechanism to tackle catastrophic forgetting.

Result: Experiments show DAILOC achieves up to 2.74x lesser average error and 4.6x lower worst-case error compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: DAILOC successfully integrates solutions for temporal and device-induced domain shifts, making indoor localization systems more robust and reliable.

Abstract: Wi-Fi fingerprinting-based indoor localization faces significant challenges
in real-world deployments due to domain shifts arising from device
heterogeneity and temporal variations within indoor environments. Existing
approaches often address these issues independently, resulting in poor
generalization and susceptibility to catastrophic forgetting over time. In this
work, we propose DAILOC, a novel domain-incremental learning framework that
jointly addresses both temporal and device-induced domain shifts. DAILOC
introduces a novel disentanglement strategy that separates domain shifts from
location-relevant features using a multi-level variational autoencoder.
Additionally, we introduce a novel memory-guided class latent alignment
mechanism to address the effects of catastrophic forgetting over time.
Experiments across multiple smartphones, buildings, and time instances
demonstrate that DAILOC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
achieving up to 2.74x lower average error and 4.6x lower worst-case error.

*Danish Gufran,Sudeep Pasricha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduces LogNet, a transparent logic gate-based framework for interpreting and enhancing deep learning (DL) models in indoor localization. LogNet improves localization accuracy and stability in response to environmental noise and temporal variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DL frameworks for indoor localization are often black-box models, which lack interpretability. This hampers understanding of their sensitivity to temporal variations caused by environmental factors and limits their long-term adaptability.

Method: LogNet, a novel logic gate-based framework, was developed to make predictions more interpretable, enabling transparent reasoning and diagnosing failures. It identifies the influential access points (APs) for each reference point (RP) and shows the impact of environmental noise.

Result: LogNet demonstrated significant improvements in performance across multiple real-world building floorplans over two years of temporal variations. It achieves 1.1x to 2.8x lower localization error, a 3.4x to 43.3x smaller model size, and 1.5x to 3.6x lower latency compared to previous DL-based models.

Conclusion: LogNet enhances both interpretability and performance of DL-based indoor localization systems, providing a practical solution for long-term, reliable deployment by addressing environmental dynamics and temporal variations effectively.

Abstract: Indoor localization using deep learning (DL) has demonstrated strong accuracy
in mapping Wi-Fi RSS fingerprints to physical locations; however, most existing
DL frameworks function as black-box models, offering limited insight into how
predictions are made or how models respond to real-world noise over time. This
lack of interpretability hampers our ability to understand the impact of
temporal variations - caused by environmental dynamics - and to adapt models
for long-term reliability. To address this, we introduce LogNet, a novel logic
gate-based framework designed to interpret and enhance DL-based indoor
localization. LogNet enables transparent reasoning by identifying which access
points (APs) are most influential for each reference point (RP) and reveals how
environmental noise disrupts DL-driven localization decisions. This
interpretability allows us to trace and diagnose model failures and adapt DL
systems for more stable long-term deployments. Evaluations across multiple
real-world building floorplans and over two years of temporal variation show
that LogNet not only interprets the internal behavior of DL models but also
improves performance-achieving up to 1.1x to 2.8x lower localization error,
3.4x to 43.3x smaller model size, and 1.5x to 3.6x lower latency compared to
prior DL-based models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance AI compositionality capabilities to solve complex problems efficiently and sustainably.

Method: Proposes a zero-shot Expert Composition approach by combining multiple specialized models, tested on benchmarks designed for evaluating compositional reasoning.

Result: Achieved higher accuracy compared to baseline algorithms while using fewer computational resources.

Conclusion: Expert Composition method offers an efficient approach to compositional problem-solving, advancing AI frameworks in terms of accuracy and sustainability.

Abstract: Compositionality is one of the fundamental abilities of the human reasoning
process, that allows to decompose a complex problem into simpler elements. Such
property is crucial also for neural networks, especially when aiming for a more
efficient and sustainable AI framework. We propose a compositional approach by
ensembling zero-shot a set of expert models, assessing our methodology using a

that our Expert Composition method is able to achieve a much higher accuracy
than baseline algorithms while requiring less computational resources, hence
being more efficient.

*Le Vu Anh,Nguyen Viet Anh,Mehmet Dik,Tu Nguyen Thi Ngoc*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MicroRicci introduces a fast, local Ricci-flow solver for real-time mesh smoothing that improves speed and quality compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time mesh smoothing faces challenges from costly global updates in classical methods and instability in heuristic approaches.

Method: MicroRicci uses a greedy syndrome-decoding mechanism with two neural modules to adaptively correct curvature errors and optimize updates in linear time.

Result: MicroRicci achieves a 2.4x iteration speedup, reduced curvature spread, high UV-distortion-to-MOS correlation (r = -0.93), and a 1.8x overall runtime acceleration.

Conclusion: The method offers an efficient, adaptive, and high-quality tool for applications requiring real-time and resource-efficient solutions in graphics and simulations.

Abstract: Real-time mesh smoothing at scale remains a formidable challenge: classical
Ricci-flow solvers demand costly global updates, while greedy heuristics suffer
from slow convergence or brittle tuning. We present MicroRicci, the first truly
self-tuning, local Ricci-flow solver that borrows ideas from coding theory and
packs them into just 1K + 200 parameters. Its primary core is a greedy
syndrome-decoding step that pinpoints and corrects the largest curvature error
in O(E) time, augmented by two tiny neural modules that adaptively choose
vertices and step sizes on the fly. On a diverse set of 110 SJTU-TMQA meshes,
MicroRicci slashes iteration counts from 950+=140 to 400+=80 (2.4x speedup),
tightens curvature spread from 0.19 to 0.185, and achieves a remarkable
UV-distortion-to-MOS correlation of r = -0.93. It adds only 0.25 ms per
iteration (0.80 to 1.05 ms), yielding an end-to-end 1.8x runtime acceleration
over state-of-the-art methods. MicroRicci's combination of linear-time updates,
automatic hyperparameter adaptation, and high-quality geometric and perceptual
results makes it well suited for real-time, resource-limited applications in
graphics, simulation, and related fields.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DP-GRAPE, a method for differential private (DP) neural network training that reduces memory usage while maintaining performance, suitable for large models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for DP training, such as DP-Adam, face high memory overhead due to per-sample gradient clipping, which hinders scalability in training large neural networks.

Method: DP-GRAPE introduces three main strategies: gradient projection and privatization, replacing SVD with Gaussian matrices, and applying projections during backpropagation to minimize memory usage while ensuring the same privacy-utility trade-off as DP-SGD.

Result: Experiments show significant memory savings of over 63% for Vision Transformers and over 70% for RoBERTa-Large while maintaining comparable accuracy and training time relative to DP-Adam. DP-GRAPE also scales to massive models like OPT with 6.7 billion parameters.

Conclusion: DP-GRAPE provides an efficient and scalable solution for DP training of large-scale machine learning models, achieving substantial memory savings without compromising performance or utility.

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) protects sensitive data during neural network
training, but standard methods like DP-Adam suffer from high memory overhead
due to per-sample gradient clipping, limiting scalability. We introduce
DP-GRAPE (Gradient RAndom ProjEction), a DP training method that significantly
reduces memory usage while maintaining utility on par with first-order DP
approaches. Rather than directly applying DP to GaLore, DP-GRAPE introduces
three key modifications: (1) gradients are privatized after projection, (2)
random Gaussian matrices replace SVD-based subspaces, and (3) projection is
applied during backpropagation. These contributions eliminate the need for
costly SVD computations, enable substantial memory savings, and lead to
improved utility. Despite operating in lower-dimensional subspaces, our
theoretical analysis shows that DP-GRAPE achieves a privacy-utility trade-off
comparable to DP-SGD. Our extensive empirical experiments show that DP-GRAPE
can reduce the memory footprint of DP training without sacrificing accuracy or
training time. In particular, DP-GRAPE reduces memory usage by over 63% when
pre-training Vision Transformers and over 70% when fine-tuning RoBERTa-Large as
compared to DP-Adam, while achieving similar performance. We further
demonstrate that DP-GRAPE scales to fine-tuning large models such as OPT with
up to 6.7 billion parameters.

*Modar Sulaiman,Kallol Roy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method, GFLC, to correct biased and noisy labels in datasets while ensuring fairness, improving the performance and fairness trade-offs in machine learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the critical importance of fairness in machine learning systems, which influence society in areas like healthcare and law. Many machine learning models exhibit unfair outcomes due to biased and noisy labels in training data.

Method: The method, Graph-based Fairness-aware Label Correction (GFLC), includes prediction confidence measures, graph-based regularization using Ricci-flow-optimized Laplacians, and explicit demographic parity incentives to handle label noise and fairness.

Result: Experimental findings show that GFLC significantly improves performance and fairness trade-offs over existing methods.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate the effectiveness of GFLC, providing a more robust and fair approach to label correction in machine learning datasets.

Abstract: Fairness in machine learning (ML) has a critical importance for building
trustworthy machine learning system as artificial intelligence (AI) systems
increasingly impact various aspects of society, including healthcare decisions
and legal judgments. Moreover, numerous studies demonstrate evidence of unfair
outcomes in ML and the need for more robust fairness-aware methods. However,
the data we use to train and develop debiasing techniques often contains biased
and noisy labels. As a result, the label bias in the training data affects
model performance and misrepresents the fairness of classifiers during testing.
To tackle this problem, our paper presents Graph-based Fairness-aware Label
Correction (GFLC), an efficient method for correcting label noise while
preserving demographic parity in datasets. In particular, our approach combines
three key components: prediction confidence measure, graph-based regularization
through Ricci-flow-optimized graph Laplacians, and explicit demographic parity
incentives. Our experimental findings show the effectiveness of our proposed
approach and show significant improvements in the trade-off between performance
and fairness metrics compared to the baseline.

*Ranting Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper points out limitations in Advantage-Weighted Regression (AWR) for offline reinforcement learning, caused by poor exploratory data, and proposes a novel method to tackle this.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the issue of over-conservatism in offline reinforcement learning policies due to data corruption and poor exploratory samples in suboptimal offline datasets.

Method: The authors propose the Corruption-Averse Advantage-Weighted Regression (CAWR), which uses robust loss functions during policy optimization and a prioritized experience replay strategy to filter out poor explorations.

Result: Numerical experiments using the D4RL benchmark demonstrated that their CAWR method yields superior policies and improves policy optimization performance in suboptimal offline datasets.

Conclusion: CAWR effectively mitigates the over-conservatism issue in AWR by addressing the sensitivity to corrupted data, leading to enhanced offline reinforcement learning outcomes.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (offline RL) algorithms often require
additional constraints or penalty terms to address distribution shift issues,
such as adding implicit or explicit policy constraints during policy
optimization to reduce the estimation bias of functions. This paper focuses on
a limitation of the Advantage-Weighted Regression family (AWRs), i.e., the
potential for learning over-conservative policies due to data corruption,
specifically the poor explorations in suboptimal offline data. We study it from
two perspectives: (1) how poor explorations impact the theoretically optimal
policy based on KL divergence, and (2) how such poor explorations affect the
approximation of the theoretically optimal policy. We prove that such
over-conservatism is mainly caused by the sensitivity of the loss function for
policy optimization to poor explorations, and the proportion of poor
explorations in offline datasets. To address this concern, we propose
Corruption-Averse Advantage-Weighted Regression (CAWR), which incorporates a
set of robust loss functions during policy optimization and an advantage-based
prioritized experience replay method to filter out poor explorations. Numerical
experiments on the D4RL benchmark show that our method can learn superior
policies from suboptimal offline data, significantly enhancing the performance
of policy optimization.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel learning rule for spiking neural networks (SNNs) to co-optimize synaptic strengths and delays, showing better performance than existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of integration of synaptic delays in spiking neural networks (SNNs), despite their significance in biological learning.

Method: The authors extend spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) to simultaneously learn synaptic weights and delays and validate it using an unsupervised SNN model for classification.

Result: The proposed method outperforms existing methods for co-learning weights and delays, as well as STDP without delays, in various tests.

Conclusion: The inclusion of synaptic delays enhances SNN performance and provides new insights into the relationship between synaptic efficacy and delay.

Abstract: Synaptic delays play a crucial role in biological neuronal networks, where
their modulation has been observed in mammalian learning processes. In the
realm of neuromorphic computing, although spiking neural networks (SNNs) aim to
emulate biology more closely than traditional artificial neural networks do,
synaptic delays are rarely incorporated into their simulation. We introduce a
novel learning rule for simultaneously learning synaptic connection strengths
and delays, by extending spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP), a Hebbian
method commonly used for learning synaptic weights. We validate our approach by
extending a widely-used SNN model for classification trained with unsupervised
learning. Then we demonstrate the effectiveness of our new method by comparing
it against another existing methods for co-learning synaptic weights and delays
as well as against STDP without synaptic delays. Results demonstrate that our
proposed method consistently achieves superior performance across a variety of
test scenarios. Furthermore, our experimental results yield insight into the
interplay between synaptic efficacy and delay.

Motivation: Current robot programming methods often struggle with complex, multi-behavior problems related to object interaction and robot geometry. Many solvers are domain-specific and do not utilize geometric constraints effectively.

Result: ALSPG significantly outperformed traditional second-order methods in efficiency and real-time performance, particularly in both simulation and real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: ALSPG is a competitive, efficient alternative for generating motion in robots, showing significant improvements in constraint-handling and real-time responses, with validation across diverse robotic setups.

Abstract: Generating motions for robots interacting with objects of various shapes is a
complex challenge, further complicated by the robot geometry and multiple
desired behaviors. While current robot programming tools (such as inverse
kinematics, collision avoidance, and manipulation planning) often treat these
problems as constrained optimization, many existing solvers focus on specific
problem domains or do not exploit geometric constraints effectively. We propose
an efficient first-order method, Augmented Lagrangian Spectral Projected
Gradient Descent (ALSPG), which leverages geometric projections via Euclidean
projections, Minkowski sums, and basis functions. We show that by using
geometric constraints rather than full constraints and gradients, ALSPG
significantly improves real-time performance. Compared to second-order methods
like iLQR, ALSPG remains competitive in the unconstrained case. We validate our
method through toy examples and extensive simulations, and demonstrate its
effectiveness on a 7-axis Franka robot, a 6-axis P-Rob robot and a 1:10 scale
car in real-world experiments. Source codes, experimental data and videos are

### [233] [FEAST: A Flexible Mealtime-Assistance System Towards In-the-Wild Personalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14968)
*Rajat Kumar Jenamani,Tom Silver,Ben Dodson,Shiqin Tong,Anthony Song,Yuting Yang,Ziang Liu,Benjamin Howe,Aimee Whitneck,Tapomayukh Bhattacharjee*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces FEAST, a modular, adaptable mealtime-assistance robotic system aimed at in-home meal aid personalization for users, effectively accommodating diverse needs and preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of in-home meal assistance due to the diverse activities, contexts, and user preferences, by creating a more flexible and personalized caregiving robot.

Method: The researchers developed FEAST, a modular system that combines adaptable hardware, multiple interaction options, and behavior trees modifiable by a large language model. The system is informed by a formative study and guided by adaptability, transparency, and safety principles.

Result: FEAST demonstrated superior transparency and safety in adapting to personalization needs over a state-of-the-art baseline. It was successfully personalized and validated through both in-home user studies and by an Occupational Therapist.

Conclusion: FEAST proves to be a flexible, safe, and transparent solution for in-home mealtime assistance, capable of meeting a variety of individual user needs and preferences effectively.

Abstract: Physical caregiving robots hold promise for improving the quality of life of
millions worldwide who require assistance with feeding. However, in-home meal
assistance remains challenging due to the diversity of activities (e.g.,
eating, drinking, mouth wiping), contexts (e.g., socializing, watching TV),
food items, and user preferences that arise during deployment. In this work, we
propose FEAST, a flexible mealtime-assistance system that can be personalized
in-the-wild to meet the unique needs of individual care recipients. Developed
in collaboration with two community researchers and informed by a formative
study with a diverse group of care recipients, our system is guided by three
key tenets for in-the-wild personalization: adaptability, transparency, and
safety. FEAST embodies these principles through: (i) modular hardware that
enables switching between assisted feeding, drinking, and mouth-wiping, (ii)
diverse interaction methods, including a web interface, head gestures, and
physical buttons, to accommodate diverse functional abilities and preferences,
and (iii) parameterized behavior trees that can be safely and transparently
adapted using a large language model. We evaluate our system based on the
personalization requirements identified in our formative study, demonstrating
that FEAST offers a wide range of transparent and safe adaptations and
outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline limited to fixed customizations. To
demonstrate real-world applicability, we conduct an in-home user study with two
care recipients (who are community researchers), feeding them three meals each
across three diverse scenarios. We further assess FEAST's ecological validity
by evaluating with an Occupational Therapist previously unfamiliar with the
system. In all cases, users successfully personalize FEAST to meet their
individual needs and preferences. Website: https://emprise.cs.cornell.edu/feast

*Jeffrey Mao,Raghuram Cauligi Srinivas,Steven Nogar,Giuseppe Loianno*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a real-time navigation system for quadrotors that relies solely on lightweight onboard sensors, constructing a dense 3D environmental map and generating safe, optimal trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable autonomous quadrotor operation in complex, unfamiliar environments despite constraints such as limited size, weight, power (SWaP), and the inability to use bulky sensors like LiDAR.

Method: The system fuses stereo and monocular learning-based depth estimation to create long-range, dense depth maps, and employs a novel planning and trajectory generation framework for safe, time-optimal navigation based on incremental map updates.

Result: The proposed system outperforms state-of-the-art methods in computational efficiency and obstacle avoidance and demonstrates successful navigation in diverse real-world environments during experiments.

Conclusion: The presented fully onboard system offers a promising solution for safe, autonomous navigation of quadrotors in unknown environments, addressing key challenges posed by SWaP constraints and mapping complexities.

Abstract: Quadrotors hold significant promise for several applications such as
agriculture, search and rescue, and infrastructure inspection. Achieving
autonomous operation requires systems to navigate safely through complex and
unfamiliar environments. This level of autonomy is particularly challenging due
to the complexity of such environments and the need for real-time decision
making especially for platforms constrained by size, weight, and power (SWaP),
which limits flight time and precludes the use of bulky sensors like Light
Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) for mapping. Furthermore, computing globally
optimal, collision-free paths and translating them into time-optimized, safe
trajectories in real time adds significant computational complexity. To address
these challenges, we present a fully onboard, real-time navigation system that
relies solely on lightweight onboard sensors. Our system constructs a dense 3D
map of the environment using a novel visual depth estimation approach that
fuses stereo and monocular learning-based depth, yielding longer-range, denser,
and less noisy depth maps than conventional stereo methods. Building on this
map, we introduce a novel planning and trajectory generation framework capable
of rapidly computing time-optimal global trajectories. As the map is
incrementally updated with new depth information, our system continuously
refines the trajectory to maintain safety and optimality. Both our planner and
trajectory generator outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of
computational efficiency and guarantee obstacle-free trajectories. We validate
our system through robust autonomous flight experiments in diverse indoor and
outdoor environments, demonstrating its effectiveness for safe navigation in
previously unknown settings.

*Jinjie Li,Jiaxuan Li,Kotaro Kaneko,Liming Shu,Moju Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel system for teleoperation of omnidirectional aerial robots, leveraging human hand dexterity and gestures for enhanced manipulation in complex environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Teleoperation approaches for multirotor aerial robots fail to fully harness omnidirectional control capabilities and human finger dexterity, limiting their effectiveness in aerial manipulation tasks.

Method: The system uses motion-tracking markers on the shoulder and hand, paired with a data glove to capture gestures. It introduces four interaction modes to suit varying tasks, enabling seamless mode switching based on hand gestures.

Result: The system was evaluated on a valve-turning task in a real-world scenario, showing that each interaction mode effectively supports aerial manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: The introduced teleoperation framework successfully combines human dexterity with robotic omnidirectionality, enhancing capabilities and interaction for aerial robots operating in unstructured environments.

Abstract: Omnidirectional aerial robots offer full 6-DoF independent control over
position and orientation, making them popular for aerial manipulation. Although
advancements in robotic autonomy, operating by human remains essential in
complex aerial environments. Existing teleoperation approaches for multirotors
fail to fully leverage the additional DoFs provided by omnidirectional
rotation. Additionally, the dexterity of human fingers should be exploited for
more engaged interaction. In this work, we propose an aerial teleoperation
system that brings the omnidirectionality of human hands into the unbounded
aerial workspace. Our system includes two motion-tracking marker sets -- one on
the shoulder and one on the hand -- along with a data glove to capture hand
gestures. Using these inputs, we design four interaction modes for different
tasks, including Spherical Mode and Cartesian Mode for long-range moving as
well as Operation Mode and Locking Mode for precise manipulation, where the
hand gestures are utilized for seamless mode switching. We evaluate our system
on a valve-turning task in real world, demonstrating how each mode contributes
to effective aerial manipulation. This interaction framework bridges human
dexterity with aerial robotics, paving the way for enhanced teleoperated aerial
manipulation in unstructured environments.

### [236] [Context Matters: Learning Generalizable Rewards via Calibrated Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15012)
*Alexandra Forsey-Smerek,Julie Shah,Andreea Bobu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method that explicitly separates underlying human preferences from context-dependent feature saliency for adaptive reward learning in agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional reward learning methods fail to efficiently adapt agent behavior to new contexts, often requiring the relearning of rewards from scratch, despite underlying preferences remaining consistent.

Method: The authors introduce calibrated features representing context-driven saliency changes and employ paired comparison queries to distinguish saliency from preferences, enabling modular reward representation.

Result: Experiments show 10x fewer preference queries are needed compared to baselines to achieve equivalent reward accuracy, with up to 15% better performance in sparse data scenarios.

Conclusion: This approach enhances sample efficiency, adaptability, and personalization in reward learning, showing promise for teaching agents human-contextual preferences effectively.

Abstract: A key challenge in reward learning from human input is that desired agent
behavior often changes based on context. Traditional methods typically treat
each new context as a separate task with its own reward function. For example,
if a previously ignored stove becomes too hot to be around, the robot must
learn a new reward from scratch, even though the underlying preference for
prioritizing safety over efficiency remains unchanged. We observe that context
influences not the underlying preference itself, but rather the
$\textit{saliency}$--or importance--of reward features. For instance, stove
heat affects the importance of the robot's proximity, yet the human's safety
preference stays the same. Existing multi-task and meta IRL methods learn
context-dependent representations $\textit{implicitly}$--without distinguishing
between preferences and feature importance--resulting in substantial data
requirements. Instead, we propose $\textit{explicitly}$ modeling
context-invariant preferences separately from context-dependent feature
saliency, creating modular reward representations that adapt to new contexts.
To achieve this, we introduce $\textit{calibrated features}$--representations
that capture contextual effects on feature saliency--and present specialized
paired comparison queries that isolate saliency from preference for efficient
learning. Experiments with simulated users show our method significantly
improves sample efficiency, requiring 10x fewer preference queries than
baselines to achieve equivalent reward accuracy, with up to 15% better
performance in low-data regimes (5-10 queries). An in-person user study (N=12)
demonstrates that participants can effectively teach their unique personal
contextual preferences using our method, enabling more adaptable and
personalized reward learning.

### [237] [Assigning Multi-Robot Tasks to Multitasking Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15032)
*Winston Smith,Andrew Boateng,Taha Shaheen,Yu Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel task allocation framework for multitasking robots assigned to multi-robot tasks, addressing physical constraints typically ignored in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing task allocation methods assume robots are single-tasking, which can be inefficient or infeasible in certain scenarios. The paper aims to address this limitation.

Method: The problem is formulated and solved using weighted MAX-SAT and a proposed greedy heuristic. Evaluation includes comparisons with single-tasking robot methods, simulated site-clearing, and physical experiments.

Result: The framework demonstrates improved task efficiency and showcases benefits of multitasking in synthetic, simulated, and physical scenarios.

Conclusion: Integrating multitasking constraints in task allocation methods can enable robots to perform efficiently, overcoming current limitations in single-tasking assumptions.

Abstract: One simplifying assumption in existing and well-performing task allocation
methods is that the robots are single-tasking: each robot operates on a single
task at any given time. While this assumption is harmless to make in some
situations, it can be inefficient or even infeasible in others. In this paper,
we consider assigning multi-robot tasks to multitasking robots. The key
contribution is a novel task allocation framework that incorporates the
consideration of physical constraints introduced by multitasking. This is in
contrast to the existing work where such constraints are largely ignored. After
formulating the problem, we propose a compilation to weighted MAX-SAT, which
allows us to leverage existing solvers for a solution. A more efficient greedy
heuristic is then introduced. For evaluation, we first compare our methods with
a modern baseline that is efficient for single-tasking robots to validate the
benefits of multitasking in synthetic domains. Then, using a site-clearing
scenario in simulation, we further illustrate the complex task interaction
considered by the multitasking robots in our approach to demonstrate its
performance. Finally, we demonstrate a physical experiment to show how
multitasking enabled by our approach can benefit task efficiency in a realistic
setting.

### [238] [EmojiVoice: Towards long-term controllable expressivity in robot speech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15085)
*Paige Tuttösí,Shivam Mehta,Zachary Syvenky,Bermet Burkanova,Gustav Eje Henter,Angelica Lim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces EmojiVoice, a tool enabling social robots to use temporally varied and expressive speech through emoji-prompting, improving human engagement in tasks like storytelling but not always suitable for other scenarios like robot assistants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social robots generally fail to achieve human-like expressivity in speech over extended interactions, limiting their ability to sustain user engagement.

Method: Developed EmojiVoice, a customizable TTS toolkit incorporating emoji-prompting for phase-level control of expressivity, built on the lightweight Matcha-TTS framework for real-time speech generation.

Result: Improved speech expressivity and perception in a storytelling task using emoji-prompting, though expressive voices were not universally preferred in all contexts (e.g., robot assistants).

Conclusion: EmojiVoice successfully enables varied and expressive robot speech, beneficial in certain applications but situationally dependent on user preferences.

Abstract: Humans vary their expressivity when speaking for extended periods to maintain
engagement with their listener. Although social robots tend to be deployed with
``expressive'' joyful voices, they lack this long-term variation found in human
speech. Foundation model text-to-speech systems are beginning to mimic the
expressivity in human speech, but they are difficult to deploy offline on
robots. We present EmojiVoice, a free, customizable text-to-speech (TTS)
toolkit that allows social roboticists to build temporally variable, expressive
speech on social robots. We introduce emoji-prompting to allow fine-grained
control of expressivity on a phase level and use the lightweight Matcha-TTS
backbone to generate speech in real-time. We explore three case studies: (1) a
scripted conversation with a robot assistant, (2) a storytelling robot, and (3)
an autonomous speech-to-speech interactive agent. We found that using varied
emoji prompting improved the perception and expressivity of speech over a long
period in a storytelling task, but expressive voice was not preferred in the
assistant use case.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper focuses on evolving vision tactile sensors (VTS) for human-like haptic perception, addressing challenges in adapting planar sensors to biomimetic curved surfaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to advance anthropomorphic grippers by overcoming limitations in tactile sensing technologies when transitioning from planar to biomimetic curved configurations.

Method: The researchers introduce GelSplitter3D with enhanced imaging using a prism and NIR camera, develop a photometric stereo neural network for tactile geometry calibration, and implement a normal integration method with boundary constraints to mitigate cumulative errors.

Result: The developed sensing system shows a 40% improvement in normal estimation accuracy, proving its effectiveness in grasping and manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed methods significantly advance the tactile sensing performance of VTS, moving closer to human-like fingertip capabilities and enhancing robotic manipulation.

Abstract: To achieve human-like haptic perception in anthropomorphic grippers, the
compliant sensing surfaces of vision tactile sensor (VTS) must evolve from
conventional planar configurations to biomimetically curved topographies with
continuous surface gradients. However, planar VTSs have challenges when
extended to curved surfaces, including insufficient lighting of surfaces,
blurring in reconstruction, and complex spatial boundary conditions for surface
structures. With an end goal of constructing a human-like fingertip, our
research (i) develops GelSplitter3D by expanding imaging channels with a prism
and a near-infrared (NIR) camera, (ii) proposes a photometric stereo neural
network with a CAD-based normal ground truth generation method to calibrate
tactile geometry, and (iii) devises a normal integration method with boundary
constraints of depth prior information to correcting the cumulative error of
surface integrals. We demonstrate better tactile sensing performance, a 40$\%$
improvement in normal estimation accuracy, and the benefits of sensor shapes in
grasping and manipulation tasks.

TL;DR: This paper introduces DyNaVLM, a navigation framework leveraging Vision-Language Models (VLM) for flexible, task-free navigation and memory sharing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in prior navigation systems constrained by fixed angular or distance intervals while enhancing flexibility, robustness, and real-world generalization in embodied robot navigation.

Method: DyNaVLM implements a self-refining graph memory storing object locations, enables memory sharing through distributed updates, and integrates retrieval augmentation into VLM decision-making, operating without task-specific training.

Result: DyNaVLM achieves high performance in GOAT and ObjectNav benchmarks, along with validation in real-world tests for robustness and generalization.

Conclusion: DyNaVLM introduces dynamic action spaces, collaborative graph memory, and training-free deployment, offering a scalable solution for real-world embodied robot navigation and bridging traditional VLN tasks with continuous environments.

Abstract: We present DyNaVLM, an end-to-end vision-language navigation framework using
Vision-Language Models (VLM). In contrast to prior methods constrained by fixed
angular or distance intervals, our system empowers agents to freely select
navigation targets via visual-language reasoning. At its core lies a
self-refining graph memory that 1) stores object locations as executable
topological relations, 2) enables cross-robot memory sharing through
distributed graph updates, and 3) enhances VLM's decision-making via retrieval
augmentation. Operating without task-specific training or fine-tuning, DyNaVLM
demonstrates high performance on GOAT and ObjectNav benchmarks. Real-world
tests further validate its robustness and generalization. The system's three
innovations: dynamic action space formulation, collaborative graph memory, and
training-free deployment, establish a new paradigm for scalable embodied robot,
bridging the gap between discrete VLN tasks and continuous real-world
navigation.

*Paige Tuttösí*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper designs expressive, context-adaptive speech synthesis technologies tailored for teaching languages through social robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Currently, social robots for language teaching lack task-specific voices, which may compromise their effectiveness for teaching verbal communication.

Method: The authors created a lightweight TTS mechanism using a fine-tuned Matcha-TTS model, explored voice adaptations for different environments, and designed an L2 clarity mode improving tough vowel perception.

Result: The paper demonstrated enhanced expressivity, environment-aware adaptability, and improved intelligibility for L2 learners—tested through case studies.

Conclusion: This research achieved better clarity and expressiveness in TTS voices, advancing social robot capabilities for language teaching applications in diverse environments.

Abstract: While the use of social robots for language teaching has been explored, there
remains limited work on a task-specific synthesized voices for language
teaching robots. Given that language is a verbal task, this gap may have severe
consequences for the effectiveness of robots for language teaching tasks. We
address this lack of L2 teaching robot voices through three contributions: 1.
We address the need for a lightweight and expressive robot voice. Using a
fine-tuned version of Matcha-TTS, we use emoji prompting to create an
expressive voice that shows a range of expressivity over time. The voice can
run in real time with limited compute resources. Through case studies, we found
this voice more expressive, socially appropriate, and suitable for long periods
of expressive speech, such as storytelling. 2. We explore how to adapt a
robot's voice to physical and social ambient environments to deploy our voices
in various locations. We found that increasing pitch and pitch rate in noisy
and high-energy environments makes the robot's voice appear more appropriate
and makes it seem more aware of its current environment. 3. We create an
English TTS system with improved clarity for L2 listeners using known
linguistic properties of vowels that are difficult for these listeners. We used
a data-driven, perception-based approach to understand how L2 speakers use
duration cues to interpret challenging words with minimal tense (long) and lax
(short) vowels in English. We found that the duration of vowels strongly
influences the perception for L2 listeners and created an "L2 clarity mode" for
Matcha-TTS that applies a lengthening to tense vowels while leaving lax vowels
unchanged. Our clarity mode was found to be more respectful, intelligible, and
encouraging than base Matcha-TTS while reducing transcription errors in these
challenging tense/lax minimal pairs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional visual-inertial state estimators face challenges like scale estimation and loop closing in perceptually degraded underwater environments.

Method: VIMS uses low-cost sonar to enhance scale estimation and a high-sampling-rate magnetometer with magnetic field coil signatures for place recognition. It also employs a hierarchical scheme for visual-magnetic place recognition and balances local feature tracking with descriptor-based loop closing.

Result: Experimental results show VIMS significantly improves robustness and accuracy of state estimation in underwater environments.

Conclusion: VIMS addresses underwater SLAM challenges by combining visual, inertial, sonar, and magnetic data, providing a robust and computationally efficient solution.

Abstract: In this study, we present a novel simultaneous localization and mapping
(SLAM) system, VIMS, designed for underwater navigation. Conventional
visual-inertial state estimators encounter significant practical challenges in
perceptually degraded underwater environments, particularly in scale estimation
and loop closing. To address these issues, we first propose leveraging a
low-cost single-beam sonar to improve scale estimation. Then, VIMS integrates a
high-sampling-rate magnetometer for place recognition by utilizing magnetic
signatures generated by an economical magnetic field coil. Building on this, a
hierarchical scheme is developed for visual-magnetic place recognition,
enabling robust loop closure. Furthermore, VIMS achieves a balance between
local feature tracking and descriptor-based loop closing, avoiding additional
computational burden on the front end. Experimental results highlight the
efficacy of the proposed VIMS, demonstrating significant improvements in both
the robustness and accuracy of state estimation within underwater environments.

Motivation: To address the challenges in transferring RL-based humanoid robot locomotion policies to real-world applications.

Method: The study developed a code framework encompassing RL training methods, domain randomization, reward function design, and parallel structures, with validations on the Booster T1 robot.

Conclusion: This work aims to facilitate research in humanoid robotics by providing a useful, accessible tool to the community, showcased as experimental validations in both simulation and reality.

Abstract: Recent advancements in reinforcement learning (RL) have led to significant

motion policies in simulation. However, the numerous implementation details
make transferring these policies to real-world robots a challenging task. To
address this, we have developed a comprehensive code framework that covers the
entire process from training to deployment, incorporating common RL training
methods, domain randomization, reward function design, and solutions for
handling parallel structures. This library is made available as a community
resource, with detailed descriptions of its design and experimental results. We
validate the framework on the Booster T1 robot, demonstrating that the trained
policies seamlessly transfer to the physical platform, enabling capabilities
such as omnidirectional walking, disturbance resistance, and terrain
adaptability. We hope this work provides a convenient tool for the robotics
community, accelerating the development of humanoid robots. The code can be

TL;DR: The paper presents a system enabling humanoid robots to improve whole-body manipulation using tactile sensors and multimodal inputs through imitation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in humanoid whole-body manipulation like computational complexity and broad-area contact measurement, while leveraging its stability and load advantages.

Method: Developed a humanoid control system using tactile sensors and imitation learning from human teleoperation. Integrated multiple sensor modalities and combined this policy with locomotion and retargeting controls.

Result: Demonstrated successful whole-body contact manipulation combined with balance and walking in the RHP7 Kaleido humanoid robot. Vision and tactile modalities improved manipulation robustness.

Conclusion: The integration of tactile and vision sensory data into a control policy enhances a humanoid robot's ability to perform stable and precise whole-body manipulations.

Abstract: Manipulation with whole-body contact by humanoid robots offers distinct
advantages, including enhanced stability and reduced load. On the other hand,
we need to address challenges such as the increased computational cost of
motion generation and the difficulty of measuring broad-area contact. We
therefore have developed a humanoid control system that allows a humanoid robot
equipped with tactile sensors on its upper body to learn a policy for
whole-body manipulation through imitation learning based on human teleoperation
data. This policy, named tactile-modality extended ACT (TACT), has a feature to
take multiple sensor modalities as input, including joint position, vision, and
tactile measurements. Furthermore, by integrating this policy with retargeting
and locomotion control based on a biped model, we demonstrate that the
life-size humanoid robot RHP7 Kaleido is capable of achieving whole-body
contact manipulation while maintaining balance and walking. Through detailed
experimental verification, we show that inputting both vision and tactile
modalities into the policy contributes to improving the robustness of
manipulation involving broad and delicate contact.

TL;DR: A neural network for gait phase estimation using IMU data enhances exoskeleton adaptability, with improved accuracy and robustness, especially during terrain changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve gait phase estimation accuracy and robustness in exoskeletons, especially at terrain change transitions.

Method: They developed a neural network combining temporal convolution and transformer layers, with a novel pre-training strategy using channel-wise masked reconstruction.

Result: The method achieved lower error rates in gait phase estimation compared to existing methods, performing well under different terrain conditions. It also demonstrated effectiveness in hardware tests on a hip exoskeleton.

Conclusion: The proposed method can enhance exoskeletons' adaptability and functionality in diverse real-world environments, promoting safer and more efficient human-robot interaction.

Abstract: Gait phase estimation based on inertial measurement unit (IMU) signals
facilitates precise adaptation of exoskeletons to individual gait variations.
However, challenges remain in achieving high accuracy and robustness,
particularly during periods of terrain changes. To address this, we develop a
gait phase estimation neural network based on implicit modeling of human
locomotion, which combines temporal convolution for feature extraction with
transformer layers for multi-channel information fusion. A channel-wise masked
reconstruction pre-training strategy is proposed, which first treats gait phase
state vectors and IMU signals as joint observations of human locomotion, thus
enhancing model generalization. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method outperforms existing baseline approaches, achieving a gait
phase RMSE of $2.729 \pm 1.071%$ and phase rate MAE of $0.037 \pm 0.016%$ under
stable terrain conditions with a look-back window of 2 seconds, and a phase
RMSE of $3.215 \pm 1.303%$ and rate MAE of $0.050 \pm 0.023%$ under terrain
transitions. Hardware validation on a hip exoskeleton further confirms that the
algorithm can reliably identify gait cycles and key events, adapting to various
continuous motion scenarios. This research paves the way for more intelligent
and adaptive exoskeleton systems, enabling safer and more efficient human-robot
interaction across diverse real-world environments.

*Hanbit Oh,Andrea M. Salcedo-Vázquez,Ixchel G. Ramirez-Alpizar,Yukiyasu Domae*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Robust Instant Policy (RIP), a novel method enhancing in-context imitation learning (IL) to overcome hallucination issues in large language models for robotics tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address hallucination issues in large language models used for generating robot trajectories in in-context imitation learning.

Method: The proposed method, RIP, uses a Student's t-regression model to aggregate multiple LLM-generated trajectories, mitigating the impact of hallucinated outliers and generating robust trajectories.

Result: Experiments in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrated a significant improvement (at least 26%) in task success rates over state-of-the-art imitation learning methods, especially in low-data scenarios.

Conclusion: RIP enhances the reliability of LLM-based in-context imitation learning for robotics by effectively addressing hallucination issues, offering a promising solution for low-data scenarios and everyday tasks.

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) aims to enable robots to perform tasks autonomously
by observing a few human demonstrations. Recently, a variant of IL, called
In-Context IL, utilized off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) as instant
policies that understand the context from a few given demonstrations to perform
a new task, rather than explicitly updating network models with large-scale
demonstrations. However, its reliability in the robotics domain is undermined
by hallucination issues such as LLM-based instant policy, which occasionally
generates poor trajectories that deviate from the given demonstrations. To
alleviate this problem, we propose a new robust in-context imitation learning
algorithm called the robust instant policy (RIP), which utilizes a Student's
t-regression model to be robust against the hallucinated trajectories of
instant policies to allow reliable trajectory generation. Specifically, RIP
generates several candidate robot trajectories to complete a given task from an
LLM and aggregates them using the Student's t-distribution, which is beneficial
for ignoring outliers (i.e., hallucinations); thereby, a robust trajectory
against hallucinations is generated. Our experiments, conducted in both
simulated and real-world environments, show that RIP significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art IL methods, with at least $26\%$ improvement in task success
rates, particularly in low-data scenarios for everyday tasks. Video results

*Hanjun Kim,Minwoo Jung,Wooseong Yang,Ayoung Kim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces SHeRLoc, a deep network for heterogeneous radar place recognition, achieving significant improvement in performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current research largely focuses on homogeneous radar types, ignoring the potential of heterogeneous radar integration and cross-modality challenges.

Method: The method involves RCS polar matching for alignment, hierarchical optimal transport for feature aggregation, FFT-similarity for data mining, and adaptive margin-based triplet loss for metric learning.

Result: SHeRLoc improves recall@1 from below 0.1 to 0.9 on a public dataset and surpasses state-of-the-art methods in heterogeneous radar place recognition.

Conclusion: SHeRLoc demonstrates the potential for heterogeneous sensor integration in robotics and sets the groundwork for cross-modal recognition and SLAM, with its code made available for broader research use.

Abstract: Despite the growing adoption of radar in robotics, the majority of research
has been confined to homogeneous sensor types, overlooking the integration and
cross-modality challenges inherent in heterogeneous radar technologies. This
leads to significant difficulties in generalizing across diverse radar data
types, with modality-aware approaches that could leverage the complementary
strengths of heterogeneous radar remaining unexplored. To bridge these gaps, we
propose SHeRLoc, the first deep network tailored for heterogeneous radar, which
utilizes RCS polar matching to align multimodal radar data. Our hierarchical
optimal transport-based feature aggregation method generates rotationally
robust multi-scale descriptors. By employing FFT-similarity-based data mining
and adaptive margin-based triplet loss, SHeRLoc enables FOV-aware metric
learning. SHeRLoc achieves an order of magnitude improvement in heterogeneous
radar place recognition, increasing recall@1 from below 0.1 to 0.9 on a public
dataset and outperforming state of-the-art methods. Also applicable to LiDAR,
SHeRLoc paves the way for cross-modal place recognition and heterogeneous
sensor SLAM. The source code will be available upon acceptance.

*Lucas Schulze,Jan Peters,Oleg Arenz*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper extends deep Lagrangian networks (DeLaN) to context-aware modeling and integrates them with Model Predictive Control (MPC) for adaptive and physics-informed robotic control, achieving significant improvements in trajectory tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In complex environments, robots need context-aware dynamic models due to the infeasibility of a single global model to handle uncertain properties and numerous interacting objects while maintaining physical plausibility.

Method: The study extends DeLaN to context-aware modeling, incorporates a recurrent network for online system identification, integrates this with MPC, and combines DeLaN with a residual dynamics model to utilize nominal robot models.

Result: The proposed method reduces the end-effector tracking error by 39% in a 7-DOF robot arm for trajectory tracking, outperforming a baseline method using an extended Kalman filter that achieved 21% improvement.

Conclusion: The integration of context-aware physics-informed models with MPC significantly enhances robotic control's accuracy and adaptability, demonstrating the method's superiority over traditional approaches.

Abstract: Controlling a robot based on physics-informed dynamic models, such as deep
Lagrangian networks (DeLaN), can improve the generalizability and
interpretability of the resulting behavior. However, in complex environments,
the number of objects to potentially interact with is vast, and their physical
properties are often uncertain. This complexity makes it infeasible to employ a
single global model. Therefore, we need to resort to online system
identification of context-aware models that capture only the currently relevant
aspects of the environment. While physical principles such as the conservation
of energy may not hold across varying contexts, ensuring physical plausibility
for any individual context-aware model can still be highly desirable,
particularly when using it for receding horizon control methods such as Model
Predictive Control (MPC). Hence, in this work, we extend DeLaN to make it
context-aware, combine it with a recurrent network for online system
identification, and integrate it with a MPC for adaptive, physics-informed
control. We also combine DeLaN with a residual dynamics model to leverage the
fact that a nominal model of the robot is typically available. We evaluate our
method on a 7-DOF robot arm for trajectory tracking under varying loads. Our
method reduces the end-effector tracking error by 39%, compared to a 21%
improvement achieved by a baseline that uses an extended Kalman filter.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that combining offense and defense strategies within robot systems creates self-defending capabilities, significantly advancing robot cybersecurity.

Abstract: Offensive Robot Cybersecurity introduces a groundbreaking approach by
advocating for offensive security methods empowered by means of automation. It
emphasizes the necessity of understanding attackers' tactics and identifying
vulnerabilities in advance to develop effective defenses, thereby improving
robots' security posture. This thesis leverages a decade of robotics
experience, employing Machine Learning and Game Theory to streamline the
vulnerability identification and exploitation process. Intrinsically, the
thesis uncovers a profound connection between robotic architecture and
cybersecurity, highlighting that the design and creation aspect of robotics
deeply intertwines with its protection against attacks. This duality -- whereby
the architecture that shapes robot behavior and capabilities also necessitates
a defense mechanism through offensive and defensive cybersecurity strategies --
creates a unique equilibrium. Approaching cybersecurity with a dual perspective
of defense and attack, rooted in an understanding of systems architecture, has
been pivotal. Through comprehensive analysis, including ethical considerations,
the development of security tools, and executing cyber attacks on robot
software, hardware, and industry deployments, this thesis proposes a novel
architecture for cybersecurity cognitive engines. These engines, powered by
advanced game theory and machine learning, pave the way for autonomous
offensive cybersecurity strategies for robots, marking a significant shift
towards self-defending robotic systems. This research not only underscores the
importance of offensive measures in enhancing robot cybersecurity but also sets
the stage for future advancements where robots are not just resilient to cyber
threats but are equipped to autonomously safeguard themselves.

Motivation: The study aims to improve the efficiency and safety of underwater gliders tasked with detecting radioactive sources in a defined area.

Method: The authors evaluate TSP, MST, and OCP path-planning strategies through MATLAB simulations, measuring processing time, uncovered areas, path length, and traversal time.

Result: The OCP method performs best under traversal time constraints but is computationally expensive, whereas MST offers faster but less optimal solutions.

Conclusion: The paper provides recommendations for selecting path-planning methods based on the trade-off between efficiency and computational demands.

Abstract: In many applications, including underwater robotics, the coverage problem
requires an autonomous vehicle to systematically explore a defined area while
minimizing redundancy and avoiding obstacles. This paper investigates coverage
path planning strategies to enhance the efficiency of underwater gliders,
particularly in maximizing the probability of detecting a radioactive source
while ensuring safe navigation.
  We evaluate three path-planning approaches: the Traveling Salesman Problem
(TSP), Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), and Optimal Control Problem (OCP).
Simulations were conducted in MATLAB, comparing processing time, uncovered
areas, path length, and traversal time. Results indicate that OCP is preferable
when traversal time is constrained, although it incurs significantly higher
computational costs. Conversely, MST-based approaches provide faster but less
optimal solutions. These findings offer insights into selecting appropriate
algorithms based on mission priorities, balancing efficiency and computational
feasibility.

Ablation studies confirm the role of individual components, and qualitative analysis validates the obstacle property estimation.

Conclusion: The approach enhances the effectiveness of NAMO tasks, offering a promising solution for dynamic and reliable mobile manipulator navigation in complex environments.

Abstract: We propose a hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) framework for
efficient Navigation Among Movable Obstacles (NAMO) using a mobile manipulator.
Our approach combines interaction-based obstacle property estimation with
structured pushing strategies, facilitating the dynamic manipulation of
unforeseen obstacles while adhering to a pre-planned global path. The
high-level policy generates pushing commands that consider environmental
constraints and path-tracking objectives, while the low-level policy precisely
and stably executes these commands through coordinated whole-body movements.
Comprehensive simulation-based experiments demonstrate improvements in
performing NAMO tasks, including higher success rates, shortened traversed path
length, and reduced goal-reaching times, compared to baselines. Additionally,
ablation studies assess the efficacy of each component, while a qualitative

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MCOO-SLAM leverages a multi-camera setup for robust object-level SLAM with enhanced semantic and viewpoint-invariant mapping in outdoor settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing object-level SLAM systems relying on monocular or RGB-D sensors face challenges such as limited depth perception, occlusion, and narrow fields of view, limiting object modeling accuracy and data association in outdoor scenarios.

Method: The system integrates multi-camera omnidirectional configurations with point features and object-level landmarks enriched by open-vocabulary semantics. It uses a semantic-geometric-temporal fusion strategy for object association across views and incorporates an omnidirectional loop closure module for viewpoint-invariant place recognition.

Result: Experiments show that MCOO-SLAM achieves highly accurate localization and scalable object-level mapping, improving robustness against occlusions, pose variations, and environmental complexities.

Conclusion: MCOO-SLAM offers a robust and semantically enriched SLAM framework suitable for complex outdoor environments, addressing key limitations of existing systems through innovative multi-camera and semantic integration.

Abstract: Object-level SLAM offers structured and semantically meaningful environment
representations, making it more interpretable and suitable for high-level
robotic tasks. However, most existing approaches rely on RGB-D sensors or
monocular views, which suffer from narrow fields of view, occlusion
sensitivity, and limited depth perception-especially in large-scale or outdoor
environments. These limitations often restrict the system to observing only
partial views of objects from limited perspectives, leading to inaccurate
object modeling and unreliable data association. In this work, we propose
MCOO-SLAM, a novel Multi-Camera Omnidirectional Object SLAM system that fully
leverages surround-view camera configurations to achieve robust, consistent,
and semantically enriched mapping in complex outdoor scenarios. Our approach
integrates point features and object-level landmarks enhanced with
open-vocabulary semantics. A semantic-geometric-temporal fusion strategy is
introduced for robust object association across multiple views, leading to
improved consistency and accurate object modeling, and an omnidirectional loop
closure module is designed to enable viewpoint-invariant place recognition
using scene-level descriptors. Furthermore, the constructed map is abstracted
into a hierarchical 3D scene graph to support downstream reasoning tasks.
Extensive experiments in real-world demonstrate that MCOO-SLAM achieves
accurate localization and scalable object-level mapping with improved
robustness to occlusion, pose variation, and environmental complexity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in the simultaneous performance of underwater, surface, and aerial movements in current aquatic-aerial robots.

Method: The authors design SurfAAV with a differential thrust vectoring hydrofoil for multimodal capabilities, eliminating a buoyancy adjustment system, and develop control laws for its operation.

Result: SurfAAV achieves a surface gliding speed of 7.96 m/s and underwater cruising speed of 3.1 m/s, surpassing existing solutions in maneuverability.

Conclusion: SurfAAV provides an efficient solution for multimodal movement with superior performance, embodying advancements in aquatic-aerial robotics.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in the research of aquatic-aerial robots,
existing configurations struggle to efficiently perform underwater, surface,
and aerial movement simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel
multimodal surfing aquatic-aerial vehicle, SurfAAV, which efficiently
integrates underwater navigation, surface gliding, and aerial flying
capabilities. Thanks to the design of the novel differential thrust vectoring
hydrofoil, SurfAAV can achieve efficient surface gliding and underwater
navigation without the need for a buoyancy adjustment system. This design
provides flexible operational capabilities for both surface and underwater
tasks, enabling the robot to quickly carry out underwater monitoring
activities. Additionally, when it is necessary to reach another water body,
SurfAAV can switch to aerial mode through a gliding takeoff, flying to the
target water area to perform corresponding tasks. The main contribution of this
letter lies in proposing a new solution for underwater, surface, and aerial
movement, designing a novel hybrid prototype concept, developing the required
control laws, and validating the robot's ability to successfully perform
surface gliding and gliding takeoff. SurfAAV achieves a maximum surface gliding
speed of 7.96 m/s and a maximum underwater speed of 3.1 m/s. The prototype's
surface gliding maneuverability and underwater cruising maneuverability both
exceed those of existing aquatic-aerial vehicles.

Result: The method was tested on two different mobile robots—a forklift and a quadcopter—and yielded robust initialization with low positioning errors, outperforming current state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is effective for real-world applications and available as open-source code, emphasizing its adaptability and utility in navigation systems.

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for the real-time initialization of unknown
Ultra-Wideband (UWB) anchors in UWB-aided navigation systems. The method is
designed for localization solutions where UWB modules act as supplementary
sensors. Our approach enables the automatic detection and calibration of
previously unknown anchors during operation, removing the need for manual
setup. By combining an online Positional Dilution of Precision (PDOP)
estimation, a lightweight outlier detection method, and an adaptive robust
kernel for non-linear optimization, our approach significantly improves
robustness and suitability for real-world applications compared to
state-of-the-art. In particular, we show that our metric which triggers an
initialization decision is more conservative than current ones commonly based
on initial linear or non-linear initialization guesses. This allows for better
initialization geometry and subsequently lower initialization errors. We
demonstrate the proposed approach on two different mobile robots: an autonomous
forklift and a quadcopter equipped with a UWB-aided Visual-Inertial Odometry
(VIO) framework. The results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed method
with robust initialization and low positioning error. We open-source our code
in a C++ library including a ROS wrapper.

Result: The framework was validated through simulations and real-world experiments, proving its effectiveness in improving manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: The approach successfully maximized workspace utilization and improved operational efficiency for aerial robotic systems.

Abstract: The workspace limits the operational capabilities and range of motion for the
systems with robotic arms. Maximizing workspace utilization has the potential
to provide more optimal solutions for aerial manipulation tasks, increasing the
system's flexibility and operational efficiency. In this paper, we introduce a
novel planning framework for aerial grasping that maximizes workspace
utilization. We formulate an optimization problem to optimize the aerial
manipulator's trajectory, incorporating task constraints to achieve efficient
manipulation. To address the challenge of incorporating the delta arm's
non-convex workspace into optimization constraints, we leverage a Multilayer
Perceptron (MLP) to map position points to feasibility
probabilities.Furthermore, we employ Reversible Residual Networks (RevNet) to
approximate the complex forward kinematics of the delta arm, utilizing

Motivation: To overcome challenges in task-oriented grasping related to task semantics, object affordances, and functional constraints for specific tasks.

Method: Developed a training-free framework (GRIM) that combines geometric cues and PCA-reduced DINO features for initial alignment, followed by grasp pose transfer and refinement.

Result: GRIM demonstrated robust task-oriented grasping performance with minimal conditioning examples, surpassing learning-based methods.

Conclusion: GRIM achieves strong generalization and performance in task-oriented grasping without the need for extensive training, addressing significant challenges in the field.

Abstract: Task-Oriented Grasping (TOG) presents a significant challenge, requiring a
nuanced understanding of task semantics, object affordances, and the functional
constraints dictating how an object should be grasped for a specific task. To
address these challenges, we introduce GRIM (Grasp Re-alignment via Iterative
Matching), a novel training-free framework for task-oriented grasping.
Initially, a coarse alignment strategy is developed using a combination of
geometric cues and principal component analysis (PCA)-reduced DINO features for
similarity scoring. Subsequently, the full grasp pose associated with the
retrieved memory instance is transferred to the aligned scene object and
further refined against a set of task-agnostic, geometrically stable grasps
generated for the scene object, prioritizing task compatibility. In contrast to
existing learning-based methods, GRIM demonstrates strong generalization

Result: ViA outperforms baseline systems in three complex bimanual manipulation tasks involving visual occlusions.

Conclusion: This novel approach enables robust visuomotor policy learning, advancing active perception for robotic manipulation tasks.

Abstract: We present Vision in Action (ViA), an active perception system for bimanual
robot manipulation. ViA learns task-relevant active perceptual strategies
(e.g., searching, tracking, and focusing) directly from human demonstrations.
On the hardware side, ViA employs a simple yet effective 6-DoF robotic neck to
enable flexible, human-like head movements. To capture human active perception
strategies, we design a VR-based teleoperation interface that creates a shared
observation space between the robot and the human operator. To mitigate VR
motion sickness caused by latency in the robot's physical movements, the
interface uses an intermediate 3D scene representation, enabling real-time view
rendering on the operator side while asynchronously updating the scene with the
robot's latest observations. Together, these design elements enable the
learning of robust visuomotor policies for three complex, multi-stage bimanual

Motivation: The challenge in modeling deformable objects lies in the difficulty of accounting for their diverse physical properties and estimating states from limited visual information.

Method: The authors use a hybrid representation combining object particles and spatial grids. This framework predicts particle movements, captures 3D shape/motion information, and incorporates Gaussian Splattings for rendering, trained via learning-based methods on sparse-view RGB-D robot interaction data.

Result: The model successfully learns the dynamics of various deformable objects (e.g., ropes, cloths, stuffed animals), outperforms state-of-the-art simulators (learning-based and physics-based) in limited camera setups, and generalizes to unseen object instances.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively models and predicts deformable object dynamics, supports model-based planning tasks, and enables goal-directed object manipulation using limited and diverse visual input.

Abstract: Modeling the dynamics of deformable objects is challenging due to their
diverse physical properties and the difficulty of estimating states from
limited visual information. We address these challenges with a neural dynamics
framework that combines object particles and spatial grids in a hybrid
representation. Our particle-grid model captures global shape and motion
information while predicting dense particle movements, enabling the modeling of
objects with varied shapes and materials. Particles represent object shapes,
while the spatial grid discretizes the 3D space to ensure spatial continuity
and enhance learning efficiency. Coupled with Gaussian Splattings for visual
rendering, our framework achieves a fully learning-based digital twin of
deformable objects and generates 3D action-conditioned videos. Through
experiments, we demonstrate that our model learns the dynamics of diverse
objects -- such as ropes, cloths, stuffed animals, and paper bags -- from
sparse-view RGB-D recordings of robot-object interactions, while also
generalizing at the category level to unseen instances. Our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art learning-based and physics-based simulators,
particularly in scenarios with limited camera views. Furthermore, we showcase

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces a verification framework for proving the absence of communication races in distributed programs implemented in a subset of the Go programming language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges programmers face in reasoning about concurrency in distributed systems, particularly avoiding communication races.

Method: The method involves statically analyzing distributed programs to determine their execution order, extending happens-before logic to handle both buffered and unbuffered channels.

Result: The authors developed a framework capable of verifying distributed programs for communication race-free behavior.

Conclusion: The study enables developers to use message-passing synchronization in Go programs without worrying about unpredictable communication race behaviors.

Abstract: Programmers of distributed systems need to reason about concurrency to avoid
races. However, reasoning about concurrency is difficult, and unexpected races
show up as bugs. Data race detection in shared memory systems is well-studied
(dynamic data race detection [13], behavioral types [15], dynamic race
detection [31]). Similar to how a data race consists of reads and writes not
related by happens-before at a shared memory location, a communication race
consists of receives and sends not related by happens-before on a shared
channel. Communication races are problematic: a receiver expects a specific
message from a specific sender, but with a communication race, the receiver can
receive a message meant for another receiver, or not receive anything at all.
In this work, we describe a verification framework that can prove the absence
of communication races for distributed programs that use a subset of the Go
programming language, where synchronization is mainly achieved via message
passing. We statically reason about how a distributed program executes, using a
happens-before order, extended to buffered and unbuffered channels.

Conclusion: Program characteristics play a crucial role in fuzzing performance, and incorporating them into benchmarks is essential for accurate evaluation.

Abstract: Fuzzing is a powerful software testing technique renowned for its
effectiveness in identifying software vulnerabilities. Traditional fuzzing
evaluations typically focus on overall fuzzer performance across a set of
target programs, yet few benchmarks consider how fine-grained program features
influence fuzzing effectiveness. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel
benchmark designed to generate programs with configurable, fine-grained program
features to enhance fuzzing evaluations. We reviewed 25 recent grey-box fuzzing
studies, extracting 7 program features related to control-flow and data-flow
that can impact fuzzer performance. Using these features, we generated a
benchmark consisting of 153 programs controlled by 10 fine-grained configurable
parameters. We evaluated 11 popular fuzzers using this benchmark. The results
indicate that fuzzer performance varies significantly based on the program
features and their strengths, highlighting the importance of incorporating
program characteristics into fuzzing evaluations.

*Haosheng Zuo,Feifei Niu,Chuanyi Li*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: ERAP leverages machine learning, with LLM significantly outperforming traditional methods in approval prediction, achieving 79% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate enhancement report approval prediction, reducing the time/resource burden and extracting valuable insights efficiently.

Method: Evaluates 18 LLM variants (e.g., BERT, GPT-3.5-turbo) vs. traditional models (CNN/LSTM-BERT/GloVe) using accuracy and recall metrics, analyzing the effect of creator profiles and fine-tuning techniques.

Result: LoRA-tuned Llama 3.1 8B Instruct achieves 79% accuracy, 76.1% recall for approvals, outperforming traditional methods by 5% and addressing class imbalance.

Conclusion: LLMs outperform traditional models in ERAP, improving accuracy, recall, and operational efficiency while providing insights into underperformance cases and future research directions.

Abstract: Enhancement reports (ERs) serve as a critical communication channel between
users and developers, capturing valuable suggestions for software improvement.
However, manually processing these reports is resource-intensive, leading to
delays and potential loss of valuable insights. To address this challenge,
enhancement report approval prediction (ERAP) has emerged as a research focus,
leveraging machine learning techniques to automate decision-making. While
traditional approaches have employed feature-based classifiers and deep
learning models, recent advancements in large language models (LLM) present new
opportunities for enhancing prediction accuracy. This study systematically
evaluates 18 LLM variants (including BERT, RoBERTa, DeBERTa-v3, ELECTRA, and
XLNet for encoder models; GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o-mini, Llama 3.1 8B, Llama 3.1
8B Instruct and DeepSeek-V3 for decoder models) against traditional methods
(CNN/LSTM-BERT/GloVe). Our experiments reveal two key insights: (1)
Incorporating creator profiles increases unfine-tuned decoder-only models'
overall accuracy by 10.8 percent though it may introduce bias; (2) LoRA
fine-tuned Llama 3.1 8B Instruct further improve performance, reaching 79
percent accuracy and significantly enhancing recall for approved reports (76.1
percent vs. LSTM-GLOVE's 64.1 percent), outperforming traditional methods by 5
percent under strict chronological evaluation and effectively addressing class
imbalance issues. These findings establish LLM as a superior solution for ERAP,
demonstrating their potential to streamline software maintenance workflows and
improve decision-making in real-world development environments. We also
investigated and summarized the ER cases where the large models underperformed,
providing valuable directions for future research.

TL;DR: The paper systematically reviews how Large Language Models (LLMs) are utilized for automating unit testing tasks, categorizing the tasks, addressing challenges, and providing future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide clarity in the rapidly evolving field of LLM-based unit testing by summarizing achievements, identifying challenges, and highlighting opportunities.

Method: Conducted a systematic literature review analyzing numerous papers on LLM applications in unit testing.

Result: The paper categorizes LLM-supported tasks, explores integration strategies, identifies unresolved issues, and lists future research opportunities.

Conclusion: This work serves as a guideline and comprehensive reference for the unit testing community, aimed at fostering further advancements in LLM-driven research.

Abstract: Unit testing is a fundamental practice in modern software engineering, with
the aim of ensuring the correctness, maintainability, and reliability of
individual software components. Very recently, with the advances in Large
Language Models (LLMs), a rapidly growing body of research has leveraged LLMs
to automate various unit testing tasks, demonstrating remarkable performance
and significantly reducing manual effort. However, due to ongoing explorations
in the LLM-based unit testing field, it is challenging for researchers to
understand existing achievements, open challenges, and future opportunities.
This paper presents the first systematic literature review on the application
of LLMs in unit testing until March 2025. We analyze \numpaper{} relevant
papers from the perspectives of both unit testing and LLMs. We first categorize
existing unit testing tasks that benefit from LLMs, e.g., test generation and
oracle generation. We then discuss several critical aspects of integrating LLMs
into unit testing research, including model usage, adaptation strategies, and
hybrid approaches. We further summarize key challenges that remain unresolved
and outline promising directions to guide future research in this area.
Overall, our paper provides a systematic overview of the research landscape to
the unit testing community, helping researchers gain a comprehensive

### [266] [Uncovering Intention through LLM-Driven Code Snippet Description Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15453)
*Yusuf Sulistyo Nugroho,Farah Danisha Salam,Brittany Reid,Raula Gaikovina Kula,Kazumasa Shimari,Kenichi Matsumoto*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study evaluates the effectiveness of using a large language model (Llama) for generating descriptions of code snippets, finding moderate relevance but room for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate commonly used description types for code snippets and assess the performance of an LLM in generating these descriptions, especially for enhancing documentation in third-party libraries.

Method: The researchers manually classified descriptions from 400 code snippets derived from a dataset of 1,024,579 examples. They then used Llama to generate descriptions for these snippets and compared them to the originals through similarity scoring.

Result: Llama performed well in classifying descriptions (79.75% alignment with manual findings), but with an average similarity score of 0.7173 to original descriptions, indicating room for improvement in relevance.

Conclusion: LLMs like Llama show promise for generating relevant code snippet descriptions, especially example-based usage, but enhancements are needed to align closer to human-written descriptions, especially for diverse documentation intents.

Abstract: Documenting code snippets is essential to pinpoint key areas where both
developers and users should pay attention. Examples include usage examples and
other Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), which are especially important
for third-party libraries. With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), the
key goal is to investigate the kinds of description developers commonly use and
evaluate how well an LLM, in this case Llama, can support description
generation. We use NPM Code Snippets, consisting of 185,412 packages with
1,024,579 code snippets. From there, we use 400 code snippets (and their
descriptions) as samples. First, our manual classification found that the
majority of original descriptions (55.5%) highlight example-based usage. This
finding emphasizes the importance of clear documentation, as some descriptions
lacked sufficient detail to convey intent. Second, the LLM correctly identified
the majority of original descriptions as "Example" (79.75%), which is identical
to our manual finding, showing a propensity for generalization. Third, compared
to the originals, the produced description had an average similarity score of
0.7173, suggesting relevance but room for improvement. Scores below 0.9
indicate some irrelevance. Our results show that depending on the task of the
code snippet, the intention of the document may differ from being instructions
for usage, installations, or descriptive learning examples for any user of a
library.

*Yilin Zhang,Xinran Zhao,Zora Zhiruo Wang,Chenyang Yang,Jiayi Wei,Tongshuang Wu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for structure-aware chunking using Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) to improve retrieval-augmented code generation. The method ensures semantic coherence and boosts performance across various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing line-based chunking methods for RAG pipelines, which often disrupt semantic structures, negatively impacting the quality of code generation.

Method: The paper proposes a structure-aware chunking approach using Abstract Syntax Trees (AST). It recursively breaks large nodes and merges siblings, ensuring semantic coherence while adhering to size constraints.

Result: The method demonstrates improved performance on key benchmarks: a 4.3-point Recall@5 boost in RepoEval retrieval and a 2.67-point Pass@1 improvement in SWE-bench code generation.

Conclusion: Structure-aware chunking is crucial for scaling retrieval-augmented code intelligence, as it ensures semantic coherence and enhances the effectiveness of code generation pipelines.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become essential for large-scale
code generation, grounding predictions in external code corpora to improve
actuality. However, a critical yet underexplored aspect of RAG pipelines is
chunking -- the process of dividing documents into retrievable units. Existing
line-based chunking heuristics often break semantic structures, splitting
functions or merging unrelated code, which can degrade generation quality. We
propose chunking via Abstract Syntax Trees (\ourwork), a structure-aware method
that recursively breaks large AST nodes into smaller chunks and merges sibling
nodes while respecting size limits. This approach generates self-contained,
semantically coherent units across programming languages and tasks, improving
performance on diverse code generation tasks, e.g., boosting Recall@5 by 4.3
points on RepoEval retrieval and Pass@1 by 2.67 points on SWE-bench generation.
Our work highlights the importance of structure-aware chunking for scaling
retrieval-enhanced code intelligence.

### [268] [An Empirical Study of Bugs in Data Visualization Libraries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15084)
*Weiqi Lu,Yongqiang Tian,Xiaohan Zhong,Haoyang Ma,Zhenyang Xu,Shing-Chi Cheung,Chengnian Sun*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study investigates bugs in data visualization libraries, presenting a taxonomy based on 564 bugs, identifying root causes, and exploring the use of Vision Language Models (VLMs) for detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data visualization libraries are critical for accurately conveying information, and bugs in these libraries can lead to misleading visual representations and erroneous decision-making.

Method: The authors comprehensively analyze 564 bugs across five popular DataViz libraries, categorizing their symptoms, root causes, and examining VLMs for automated bug detection.

Result: Incorrect graphic computations are the main root cause for pervasive inaccurate visualizations. VLM-based detection shows promising but variable effectiveness (29%-57%).

Conclusion: Bug detection efforts in DataViz libraries need systematic approaches, including automated techniques and taxonomy insights, though VLMs show limited reliability depending on prompt designs.

Abstract: Data visualization (DataViz) libraries play a crucial role in presentation,
data analysis, and application development, underscoring the importance of
their accuracy in transforming data into visual representations. Incorrect
visualizations can adversely impact user experience, distort information
conveyance, and influence user perception and decision-making processes. Visual
bugs in these libraries can be particularly insidious as they may not cause
obvious errors like crashes, but instead mislead users of the underlying data
graphically, resulting in wrong decision making. Consequently, a good
understanding of the unique characteristics of bugs in DataViz libraries is
essential for researchers and developers to detect and fix bugs in DataViz
libraries.
  This study presents the first comprehensive analysis of bugs in DataViz
libraries, examining 564 bugs collected from five widely-used libraries. Our
study systematically analyzes their symptoms and root causes, and provides a
detailed taxonomy. We found that incorrect/inaccurate plots are pervasive in
DataViz libraries and incorrect graphic computation is the major root cause,
which necessitates further automated testing methods for DataViz libraries.
Moreover, we identified eight key steps to trigger such bugs and two test
oracles specific to DataViz libraries, which may inspire future research in
designing effective automated testing techniques. Furthermore, with the recent
advancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs), we explored the feasibility of
applying these models to detect incorrect/inaccurate plots. The results show
that the effectiveness of VLMs in bug detection varies from 29% to 57%,
depending on the prompts, and adding more information in prompts does not
necessarily increase the effectiveness. More findings can be found in our
manuscript.

### [269] [OS-Harm: A Benchmark for Measuring Safety of Computer Use Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14866)
*Thomas Kuntz,Agatha Duzan,Hao Zhao,Francesco Croce,Zico Kolter,Nicolas Flammarion,Maksym Andriushchenko*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces OS-Harm, a benchmark for assessing the safety of LLM-based computer use agents, evaluating them on their behavior in harmful scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the growing popularity of LLM-based computer use agents, understanding their potential for harm (e.g., misuse or misbehavior) is critical for their safe adoption.

Method: The authors create OS-Harm, a benchmark built on OSWorld, featuring 150 tasks across various harm scenarios, and propose an automated evaluation judge to assess agents' accuracy and safety.

Result: Evaluations of various frontier models reveal compliance with harmful misuse queries, vulnerability to prompt injections, and occasional unsafe actions; the proposed judge aligns well with human annotations.

Conclusion: Agents must be more robust to misuse and adversarial inputs; OS-Harm is a valuable tool for advancing research on agent safety.

Abstract: Computer use agents are LLM-based agents that can directly interact with a
graphical user interface, by processing screenshots or accessibility trees.
While these systems are gaining popularity, their safety has been largely
overlooked, despite the fact that evaluating and understanding their potential
for harmful behavior is essential for widespread adoption. To address this gap,
we introduce OS-Harm, a new benchmark for measuring safety of computer use
agents. OS-Harm is built on top of the OSWorld environment and aims to test
models across three categories of harm: deliberate user misuse, prompt
injection attacks, and model misbehavior. To cover these cases, we create 150
tasks that span several types of safety violations (harassment, copyright
infringement, disinformation, data exfiltration, etc.) and require the agent to
interact with a variety of OS applications (email client, code editor, browser,
etc.). Moreover, we propose an automated judge to evaluate both accuracy and
safety of agents that achieves high agreement with human annotations (0.76 and
0.79 F1 score). We evaluate computer use agents based on a range of frontier
models - such as o4-mini, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro - and provide
insights into their safety. In particular, all models tend to directly comply
with many deliberate misuse queries, are relatively vulnerable to static prompt
injections, and occasionally perform unsafe actions. The OS-Harm benchmark is
available at https://github.com/tml-epfl/os-harm.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper introduces POCO, a forecasting model that predicts neural activity across various species and conditions with state-of-the-art accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural forecasting across multi-session, spontaneous recordings is underexplored, despite its importance for modeling brain dynamics and enabling adaptive neurotechnologies.

Method: POCO combines a lightweight univariate forecaster with a population-level encoder to capture both neuron-specific and brain-wide dynamics. It is trained on calcium imaging datasets from multiple species.

Result: POCO achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in forecasting neural activity, recovers biologically meaningful structures without labels, and adapts effectively to new recordings.

Conclusion: POCO is a scalable and versatile model for neural activity forecasting, offering insights into key design factors and paving the way for future adaptive neurotechnologies and large-scale foundation models of neural dynamics.

Abstract: Predicting future neural activity is a core challenge in modeling brain
dynamics, with applications ranging from scientific investigation to
closed-loop neurotechnology. While recent models of population activity
emphasize interpretability and behavioral decoding, neural
forecasting-particularly across multi-session, spontaneous recordings-remains
underexplored. We introduce POCO, a unified forecasting model that combines a
lightweight univariate forecaster with a population-level encoder to capture
both neuron-specific and brain-wide dynamics. Trained across five calcium
imaging datasets spanning zebrafish, mice, and C. elegans, POCO achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy at cellular resolution in spontaneous behaviors.
After pre-training, POCO rapidly adapts to new recordings with minimal
fine-tuning. Notably, POCO's learned unit embeddings recover biologically
meaningful structure-such as brain region clustering-without any anatomical
labels. Our comprehensive analysis reveals several key factors influencing
performance, including context length, session diversity, and preprocessing.
Together, these results position POCO as a scalable and adaptable approach for
cross-session neural forecasting and offer actionable insights for future model
design. By enabling accurate, generalizable forecasting models of neural
dynamics across individuals and species, POCO lays the groundwork for adaptive
neurotechnologies and large-scale efforts for neural foundation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address and analyze the challenges faced by k-means in high-dimensional noisy spaces, especially in applications like Cryo-Electron Microscopy.

Method: Theoretical analysis using simple Gaussian Mixture Models to examine failure conditions of k-means.

Result: Identified regimes where nearly all data partitions become fixed points for k-means in high-dimensional settings.

Conclusion: k-means faces significant limitations in high-noise, high-dimensional applications, requiring alternative approaches.

Abstract: Clustering and estimating cluster means are core problems in statistics and
machine learning, with k-means and Expectation Maximization (EM) being two
widely used algorithms. In this work, we provide a theoretical explanation for
the failure of k-means in high-dimensional settings with high noise and limited
sample sizes, using a simple Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). We identify regimes
where, with high probability, almost every partition of the data becomes a
fixed point of the k-means algorithm. This study is motivated by challenges in
the analysis of more complex cases, such as masked GMMs, and those arising from
applications in Cryo-Electron Microscopy.

*Gunnar König,Hidde Fokkema,Timo Freiesleben,Celestine Mendler-Dünner,Ulrike on Luxburg*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Recourse explanations in algorithmic decision systems can become invalid due to performative effects, as collective changes in applicant behavior alter statistical data and decision boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked issue of performative effects in recourse explanations, where collective actions make recommendations invalid and lead to repeated rejections.

Method: The paper offers a formal characterization of validity conditions for recourse explanations in the context of performativity, emphasizing the necessity for causal-based recommendations.

Result: The study demonstrates that recourse actions targeting non-causal variables or intervening ineffectively can lead to invalid outcomes after model refitting.

Conclusion: Standard counterfactual and causal methods should be reconsidered; instead, causal-focused approaches in recourse methods are recommended to ensure validity under performative changes.

Abstract: When applicants get rejected by an algorithmic decision system, recourse
explanations provide actionable suggestions for how to change their input
features to get a positive evaluation. A crucial yet overlooked phenomenon is
that recourse explanations are performative: When many applicants act according
to their recommendations, their collective behavior may change statistical
regularities in the data and, once the model is refitted, also the decision
boundary. Consequently, the recourse algorithm may render its own
recommendations invalid, such that applicants who make the effort of
implementing their recommendations may be rejected again when they reapply. In
this work, we formally characterize the conditions under which recourse
explanations remain valid under performativity. A key finding is that recourse
actions may become invalid if they are influenced by or if they intervene on
non-causal variables. Based on our analysis, we caution against the use of
standard counterfactual explanations and causal recourse methods, and instead
advocate for recourse methods that recommend actions exclusively on causal
variables.

*Agnimitra Dasgupta,Javier Murgoitio-Esandi,Ali Fardisi,Assad A Oberai*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: A method to infer time-dependent probability densities of multivariate stochastic processes using a novel binary classifier and gradient methods is introduced.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a method capable of accurately modeling time-dependent probability densities of stochastic processes, facilitating applications like sample synthesis and outlier detection.

Method: The approach uses a time-dependent binary classifier trained via contrastive estimation. The classifier computes the time partial derivative of the log density, with sample generation relying on stochastic interpolants and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods.

Result: The method accurately reconstructs complex, multimodal, and near-degenerate densities, scales to moderately high dimensions, and detects rare events effectively across numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a scalable and accurate framework for modeling time-dependent probability densities, enabling applications such as sample path synthesis and unsupervised outlier detection.

Abstract: We propose a data-driven method to learn the time-dependent probability
density of a multivariate stochastic process from sample paths, assuming that
the initial probability density is known and can be evaluated. Our method uses
a novel time-dependent binary classifier trained using a contrastive
estimation-based objective that trains the classifier to discriminate between
realizations of the stochastic process at two nearby time instants.
Significantly, the proposed method explicitly models the time-dependent
probability distribution, which means that it is possible to obtain the value
of the probability density within the time horizon of interest. Additionally,
the input before the final activation in the time-dependent classifier is a
second-order approximation to the partial derivative, with respect to time, of
the logarithm of the density. We apply the proposed approach to approximate the
time-dependent probability density functions for systems driven by stochastic
excitations. We also use the proposed approach to synthesize new samples of a
random vector from a given set of its realizations. In such applications, we
generate sample paths necessary for training using stochastic interpolants.
Subsequently, new samples are generated using gradient-based Markov chain Monte
Carlo methods because automatic differentiation can efficiently provide the
necessary gradient. Further, we demonstrate the utility of an explicit
approximation to the time-dependent probability density function through
applications in unsupervised outlier detection. Through several numerical
experiments, we show that the proposed method accurately reconstructs complex
time-dependent, multi-modal, and near-degenerate densities, scales effectively
to moderately high-dimensional problems, and reliably detects rare events among
real-world data.

*Xin Chen,Jason M. Klusowski,Yan Shuo Tan,Chang Yu*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a randomized ensemble of greedy forward selection estimators improved computationally and analytically for sparse linear regression. It challenges existing beliefs about ensembling mechanisms and suggests novel insights into bias-variance trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to tackle the dual challenges of computational inefficiency and the unclear mechanisms behind the predictive performance improvements of ensemble methods such as random forests.

Method: They propose a sparse linear regression ensemble randomized via feature subsampling and develop a dynamic programming-based implementation to enhance efficiency. Further, theoretical analysis of the method is presented in orthogonal feature settings.

Result: Numerical experiments demonstrate the proposed method outperforms lasso and elastic net in various scenarios, and it disproves the analogy that ensembling resembles shrinkage. Instead, randomized ensembling shifts the bias-variance trade-off curve.

Conclusion: The findings deepen the understanding of random forest-type ensembles and highlight the nuanced role of implicit regularization, which differs significantly from explicit regularization.

Abstract: Combining randomized estimators in an ensemble, such as via random forests,
has become a fundamental technique in modern data science, but can be
computationally expensive. Furthermore, the mechanism by which this improves
predictive performance is poorly understood. We address these issues in the
context of sparse linear regression by proposing and analyzing an ensemble of
greedy forward selection estimators that are randomized by feature subsampling
-- at each iteration, the best feature is selected from within a random subset.
We design a novel implementation based on dynamic programming that greatly
improves its computational efficiency. Furthermore, we show via careful
numerical experiments that our method can outperform popular methods such as
lasso and elastic net across a wide range of settings. Next, contrary to
prevailing belief that randomized ensembling is analogous to shrinkage, we show
via numerical experiments that it can simultaneously reduce training error and
degrees of freedom, thereby shifting the entire bias-variance trade-off curve
of the base estimator. We prove this fact rigorously in the setting of
orthogonal features, in which case, the ensemble estimator rescales the
ordinary least squares coefficients with a two-parameter family of logistic
weights, thereby enlarging the model search space. These results enhance our
understanding of random forests and suggest that implicit regularization in
general may have more complicated effects than explicit regularization.

### [275] [Optimal Convergence Rates of Deep Neural Network Classifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14899)
*Zihan Zhang,Lei Shi,Ding-Xuan Zhou*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper investigates binary classification on $[0,1]^d$ under Tsybakov noise and a specific compositional assumption, deriving an optimal convergence rate for classifiers independent of dimension $d$, and proving ReLU DNNs with hinge loss nearly achieve this rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the theoretical performance of ReLU deep neural networks (DNNs) under specific noise and compositional assumptions in high-dimensional binary classification tasks.

Method: Analysis under Tsybakov noise and compositional assumptions with a focus on conditional class probability functions. Derivation involves proving convergence rates and demonstrating deep ReLU networks trained with hinge loss achieve these rates.

Result: The paper establishes an optimal convergence rate for excess 0-1 risk that depends on parameters like smoothness ($\beta$), compositional depth ($q$), and effective dimensionality ($d_*$) rather than input dimension ($d$). ReLU DNNs closely achieve this rate up to a logarithmic factor.

Conclusion: This work offers significant theoretical justification for the effectiveness of ReLU DNNs in high-dimensional classification problems, noting their ability to nearly achieve optimal performance under studied assumptions. The generalized proof techniques also contribute to broader inequality analyses.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the binary classification problem on $[0,1]^d$ under
the Tsybakov noise condition (with exponent $s \in [0,\infty]$) and the
compositional assumption. This assumption requires the conditional class
probability function of the data distribution to be the composition of $q+1$
vector-valued multivariate functions, where each component function is either a
maximum value function or a H\"{o}lder-$\beta$ smooth function that depends
only on $d_*$ of its input variables. Notably, $d_*$ can be significantly
smaller than the input dimension $d$. We prove that, under these conditions,
the optimal convergence rate for the excess 0-1 risk of classifiers is $$
\left( \frac{1}{n}
\right)^{\frac{\beta\cdot(1\wedge\beta)^q}{{\frac{d_*}{s+1}+(1+\frac{1}{s+1})\cdot\beta\cdot(1\wedge\beta)^q}}}\;\;\;,
$$ which is independent of the input dimension $d$. Additionally, we
demonstrate that ReLU deep neural networks (DNNs) trained with hinge loss can
achieve this optimal convergence rate up to a logarithmic factor. This result
provides theoretical justification for the excellent performance of ReLU DNNs
in practical classification tasks, particularly in high-dimensional settings.
The technique used to establish these results extends the oracle inequality
presented in our previous work. The generalized approach is of independent
interest.

*Daqian Shao,Ashkan Soleymani,Francesco Quinzan,Marta Kwiatkowska*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces DML-CMR, a two-stage conditional moment restriction (CMR) estimator that reduces bias using a novel learning objective, achieving minimax optimal convergence of $O(N^{-1/2})$. The method is demonstrated with superior performance in causal inference tasks using DNN estimators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conditional moment restrictions are fundamental in various fields like statistics and causal inference, but existing estimators suffer from bias, especially when incorporating deep neural networks. Addressing this limitation is crucial.

Method: The paper proposes DML-CMR, an estimator in the framework of double/debiased machine learning (DML). It integrates a new learning objective in the estimation process to counter bias and achieve fast convergence.

Result: DML-CMR achieves minimax optimal convergence rate of $O(N^{-1/2})$. The technique demonstrates superior accuracy in tasks like IV regression and proximal causal learning on real-world datasets, outperforming existing approaches.

Conclusion: The introduced DML-CMR provides an unbiased and efficient solution for CMR problems, leveraging deep learning and achieving state-of-the-art results across diverse applications in causal inference.

Abstract: Solving conditional moment restrictions (CMRs) is a key problem considered in
statistics, causal inference, and econometrics, where the aim is to solve for a
function of interest that satisfies some conditional moment equalities.
Specifically, many techniques for causal inference, such as instrumental
variable (IV) regression and proximal causal learning (PCL), are CMR problems.
Most CMR estimators use a two-stage approach, where the first-stage estimation
is directly plugged into the second stage to estimate the function of interest.
However, naively plugging in the first-stage estimator can cause heavy bias in
the second stage. This is particularly the case for recently proposed CMR
estimators that use deep neural network (DNN) estimators for both stages, where
regularisation and overfitting bias is present. We propose DML-CMR, a two-stage
CMR estimator that provides an unbiased estimate with fast convergence rate
guarantees. We derive a novel learning objective to reduce bias and develop the
DML-CMR algorithm following the double/debiased machine learning (DML)
framework. We show that our DML-CMR estimator can achieve the minimax optimal
convergence rate of $O(N^{-1/2})$ under parameterisation and mild regularity
conditions, where $N$ is the sample size. We apply DML-CMR to a range of
problems using DNN estimators, including IV regression and proximal causal
learning on real-world datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance
against existing CMR estimators and algorithms tailored to those problems.

### [277] [Model Predictive Path-Following Control for a Quadrotor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15447)
*David Leprich,Mario Rosenfelder,Mario Hermle,Jingshan Chen,Peter Eberhard*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based path-following framework for drone automation, applied to a Crazyflie quadrotor, with innovative inclusion of a corridor path-following method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve drone automation by addressing limitations in existing path-following techniques: inability to handle constraints, reliance on conservative approaches, and limited application to non-linear systems.

Method: The authors build upon an MPC-based path-following framework, incorporating a cascaded control structure with an attitude controller to optimize for quadrotor hardware implementation and demanding time constraints.

Result: Real-world experiments on the Crazyflie quadrotor demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, extending its applicability to real hardware scenarios.

Conclusion: The study introduces a novel MPC-based path-following application for drones, while also presenting a corridor path-following extension to enhance adaptability in scenarios where strict path adherence is unnecessary.

Abstract: Automating drone-assisted processes is a complex task. Many solutions rely on
trajectory generation and tracking, whereas in contrast, path-following control
is a particularly promising approach, offering an intuitive and natural
approach to automate tasks for drones and other vehicles. While different
solutions to the path-following problem have been proposed, most of them lack
the capability to explicitly handle state and input constraints, are formulated
in a conservative two-stage approach, or are only applicable to linear systems.
To address these challenges, the paper is built upon a Model Predictive
Control-based path-following framework and extends its application to the
Crazyflie quadrotor, which is investigated in hardware experiments. A cascaded
control structure including an underlying attitude controller is included in
the Model Predictive Path-Following Control formulation to meet the challenging
real-time demands of quadrotor control. The effectiveness of the proposed
method is demonstrated through real-world experiments, representing, to the
best of the authors' knowledge, a novel application of this MPC-based
path-following approach to the quadrotor. Additionally, as an extension to the
original method, to allow for deviations of the path in cases where the precise
following of the path might be overly restrictive, a corridor path-following
approach is presented.

*Bahram Yaghooti,Chengyu Li,Bruno Sinopoli*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: This paper introduces a data-integrated framework to learn fractional-order nonlinear system dynamics using input-output experiments and orthonormal basis functions, tested on benchmark systems for validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fractional-order nonlinear systems are complex to model due to their memory-dependent nature. There is a need for accurate methods to learn their dynamics for practical applications.

Method: The framework involves designing input-output experiments to generate datasets, estimating fractional orders, and reconstructing vector fields using orthonormal basis functions.

Result: The proposed method accurately learns fractional-order system dynamics and shows their superiority compared to integer-order models in capturing long-range dependencies.

Conclusion: This approach effectively models fractional-order systems and demonstrates their advantages over integer-order representations, addressing challenges in accurately learning system dynamics.

Abstract: This paper presents a data-integrated framework for learning the dynamics of
fractional-order nonlinear systems in both discrete-time and continuous-time
settings. The proposed framework consists of two main steps. In the first step,
input-output experiments are designed to generate the necessary datasets for
learning the system dynamics, including the fractional order, the drift vector
field, and the control vector field. In the second step, these datasets, along
with the memory-dependent property of fractional-order systems, are used to
estimate the system's fractional order. The drift and control vector fields are
then reconstructed using orthonormal basis functions. To validate the proposed
approach, the algorithm is applied to four benchmark fractional-order systems.
The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed framework in learning the
system dynamics accurately. Finally, the same datasets are used to learn
equivalent integer-order models. The numerical comparisons demonstrate that
fractional-order models better capture long-range dependencies, highlighting
the limitations of integer-order representations.

*Wassim Bouaziz,Mathurin Videau,Nicolas Usunier,El-Mahdi El-Mhamdi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper explores indirect data poisoning in large language models (LLMs), demonstrating its feasibility for covertly embedding and detecting secrets without degrading model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of tracing and protecting datasets used in LLMs, given their reliance on diverse and hard-to-curate text sources.

Method: The authors use a gradient-based optimization prompt-tuning technique to make an LLM learn secret sequences that are absent in the training data, enabling indirect data poisoning.

Result: The study shows that embedding less than 0.005% poisoned tokens is sufficient to make an LLM covertly learn secrets, detect them with extremely high confidence ($p < 10^{-55}$), and ensure no performance degradation.

Conclusion: Indirect data poisoning offers a powerful tool for both dataset protection and usage detection in LLMs, without impacting the model's benchmark performance or requiring memorization of training data.

Abstract: The pre-training of large language models (LLMs) relies on massive text
datasets sourced from diverse and difficult-to-curate origins. Although
membership inference attacks and hidden canaries have been explored to trace
data usage, such methods rely on memorization of training data, which LM
providers try to limit. In this work, we demonstrate that indirect data
poisoning (where the targeted behavior is absent from training data) is not
only feasible but also allow to effectively protect a dataset and trace its
use. Using gradient-based optimization prompt-tuning, we make a model learn
arbitrary secret sequences: secret responses to secret prompts that are absent
from the training corpus. We validate our approach on language models
pre-trained from scratch and show that less than 0.005% of poisoned tokens are
sufficient to covertly make a LM learn a secret and detect it with extremely
high confidence ($p < 10^{-55}$) with a theoretically certifiable scheme.
Crucially, this occurs without performance degradation (on LM benchmarks) and
despite secrets never appearing in the training set.

*Georgios Androutsopoulos,Antonio Bianchi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces deepSURF, a tool combining static analysis with LLM-aided fuzzing to find memory safety vulnerabilities in Rust, focusing on unsafe code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tools for memory safety in Rust are limited in detection capability, handling Rust types, and rely on manual efforts, necessitating an improved mechanism.

Method: deepSURF combines static analysis with LLM-guided fuzzing harness generation, introduces handling generics via custom types and traits, and uses LLMs to dynamically augment fuzzing harnesses for better API interaction exploration.

Result: deepSURF was tested on 27 Rust crates and identified 20 known memory issues alongside 6 new vulnerabilities, outperforming current tools.

Conclusion: deepSURF shows significant improvements in detecting memory safety vulnerabilities in Rust, particularly in unsafe code, proving its efficacy over existing approaches.

Abstract: Although Rust ensures memory safety by default, it also permits the use of
unsafe code, which can introduce memory safety vulnerabilities if misused.
Unfortunately, existing tools for detecting memory bugs in Rust typically
exhibit limited detection capabilities, inadequately handle Rust-specific
types, or rely heavily on manual intervention.
  To address these limitations, we present deepSURF, a tool that integrates
static analysis with Large Language Model (LLM)-guided fuzzing harness
generation to effectively identify memory safety vulnerabilities in Rust
libraries, specifically targeting unsafe code. deepSURF introduces a novel
approach for handling generics by substituting them with custom types and
generating tailored implementations for the required traits, enabling the
fuzzer to simulate user-defined behaviors within the fuzzed library.
Additionally, deepSURF employs LLMs to augment fuzzing harnesses dynamically,
facilitating exploration of complex API interactions and significantly
increasing the likelihood of exposing memory safety vulnerabilities. We
evaluated deepSURF on 27 real-world Rust crates, successfully rediscovering 20
known memory safety bugs and uncovering 6 previously unknown vulnerabilities,
demonstrating clear improvements over state-of-the-art tools.

### [284] [Private Continual Counting of Unbounded Streams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15018)
*Ben Jacobsen,Kassem Fawaz*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes an improved algorithm for differentially private continual counting in cases where the input size is not predetermined, enabling smooth error and efficient computational performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods require knowing the input size beforehand to achieve optimal performance, which is impractical for unbounded inputs. The available alternative, using a doubling trick, results in suboptimal and non-smooth error.

Method: A new algorithm is introduced based on logarithmic perturbations of the function $\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-z}}$, involving novel matrix factorizations.

Result: The algorithm achieves $O(\log^{2+2\alpha}(t))$ variance, $O(t)$ space, and amortized $O(\log t)$ computational time per round, offering comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods with considerably lower resource requirements.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm provides a significant improvement in privacy, efficiency, and error smoothness for continual counting in unbounded contexts, advancing the field in both theoretical and practical terms.

Abstract: We study the problem of differentially private continual counting in the
unbounded setting where the input size $n$ is not known in advance. Current
state-of-the-art algorithms based on optimal instantiations of the matrix
mechanism cannot be directly applied here because their privacy guarantees only
hold when key parameters are tuned to $n$. Using the common `doubling trick'
avoids knowledge of $n$ but leads to suboptimal and non-smooth error. We solve
this problem by introducing novel matrix factorizations based on logarithmic
perturbations of the function $\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-z}}$ studied in prior works,
which may be of independent interest. The resulting algorithm has smooth error,
and for any $\alpha > 0$ and $t\leq n$ it is able to privately estimate the sum
of the first $t$ data points with $O(\log^{2+2\alpha}(t))$ variance. It
requires $O(t)$ space and amortized $O(\log t)$ time per round, compared to
$O(\log(n)\log(t))$ variance, $O(n)$ space and $O(n \log n)$ pre-processing
time for the nearly-optimal bounded-input algorithm of Henzinger et al. (SODA
2023). Empirically, we find that our algorithm's performance is also comparable
to theirs in absolute terms: our variance is less than $1.5\times$ theirs for
$t$ as large as $2^{24}$.

TL;DR: The paper highlights the cybersecurity risks associated with AI/ML-enabled medical devices and proposes tools for premarket risk assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the cybersecurity challenges and patient safety risks posed by the integration of AI/ML into medical devices.

Method: Analyzed public data on device recalls, adverse events, and vulnerabilities, then developed tools to assist in premarket risk assessments.

Result: Introduced a suite of tools to help security analysts evaluate risks in AI/ML-enabled medical devices.

Conclusion: Embedding cybersecurity principles during the design phase can enhance the safety of AI/ML-enabled medical devices for patients.

Abstract: The integration of AI/ML into medical devices is rapidly transforming
healthcare by enhancing diagnostic and treatment facilities. However, this
advancement also introduces serious cybersecurity risks due to the use of
complex and often opaque models, extensive interconnectivity, interoperability
with third-party peripheral devices, Internet connectivity, and vulnerabilities
in the underlying technologies. These factors contribute to a broad attack
surface and make threat prevention, detection, and mitigation challenging.
Given the highly safety-critical nature of these devices, a cyberattack on
these devices can cause the ML models to mispredict, thereby posing significant
safety risks to patients. Therefore, ensuring the security of these devices
from the time of design is essential. This paper underscores the urgency of
addressing the cybersecurity challenges in ML-enabled medical devices at the
pre-market phase. We begin by analyzing publicly available data on device
recalls and adverse events, and known vulnerabilities, to understand the threat
landscape of AI/ML-enabled medical devices and their repercussions on patient
safety. Building on this analysis, we introduce a suite of tools and techniques
designed by us to assist security analysts in conducting comprehensive
premarket risk assessments. Our work aims to empower manufacturers to embed
cybersecurity as a core design principle in AI/ML-enabled medical devices,
thereby making them safe for patients.

*Samhita Kuili,Mohammadreza Amini,Burak Kantarci*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper addresses jamming detection in 5G-NR networks using convolutional autoencoders (CAE) with advanced dataset balancing techniques, achieving superior performance metrics compared to benchmark models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the challenge of over-the-air jamming attacks in 5G-NR wireless networks, which compromise signal quality and require robust detection mechanisms.

Method: The authors simulate jamming by adding AWGN to real-world OFDM I/Q datasets and use convolutional autoencoders (CAE) for detection. They address dataset imbalance using conditional Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (CWGAN-GP). Experimental comparisons are made with benchmark models CDAE and CSAE.

Result: The proposed CAE model achieves high performance metrics: 97.33% precision, 91.33% recall, 94.08% F1-score, and 94.35% accuracy, outperforming CDAE and CSAE despite data heterogeneity.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that CAE, combined with effective augmentation through CWGAN-GP, is a robust solution for detecting jamming in 5G-NR networks, delivering superior accuracy and robustness to data heterogeneity.

Abstract: In the ever-expanding domain of 5G-NR wireless cellular networks,
over-the-air jamming attacks are prevalent as security attacks, compromising
the quality of the received signal. We simulate a jamming environment by
incorporating additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) into the real-world In-phase
and Quadrature (I/Q) OFDM datasets. A Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) is
exploited to implement a jamming detection over various characteristics such as
heterogenous I/Q datasets; extracting relevant information on Synchronization
Signal Blocks (SSBs), and fewer SSB observations with notable class imbalance.
Given the characteristics of datasets, balanced datasets are acquired by
employing a Conv1D conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial
Network-Gradient Penalty(CWGAN-GP) on both majority and minority SSB
observations. Additionally, we compare the performance and detection ability of
the proposed CAE model on augmented datasets with benchmark models:
Convolutional Denoising Autoencoder (CDAE) and Convolutional Sparse Autoencoder
(CSAE). Despite the complexity of data heterogeneity involved across all
datasets, CAE depicts the robustness in detection performance of jammed signal
by achieving average values of 97.33% precision, 91.33% recall, 94.08%
F1-score, and 94.35% accuracy over CDAE and CSAE.

Result: SimBank demonstrated robust benchmarking capabilities by conducting experiments with various PresPM methods, generating true outcomes under intervention actions.

Conclusion: SimBank is a valuable, publicly available tool for advancing research and application developments in PresPM by providing comprehensive evaluation and comparison functionalities.

Abstract: Prescriptive Process Monitoring (PresPM) is an emerging area within Process
Mining, focused on optimizing processes through real-time interventions for
effective decision-making. PresPM holds significant promise for organizations
seeking enhanced operational performance. However, the current literature faces
two key limitations: a lack of extensive comparisons between techniques and
insufficient evaluation approaches. To address these gaps, we introduce
SimBank: a simulator designed for accurate benchmarking of PresPM methods.
Modeled after a bank's loan application process, SimBank enables extensive
comparisons of both online and offline PresPM methods. It incorporates a
variety of intervention optimization problems with differing levels of
complexity and supports experiments on key causal machine learning challenges,
such as assessing a method's robustness to confounding in data. SimBank
additionally offers a comprehensive evaluation capability: for each test case,
it can generate the true outcome under each intervention action, which is not
possible using recorded datasets. The simulator incorporates parallel
activities and loops, drawing from common logs to generate cases that closely
resemble real-life process instances. Our proof of concept demonstrates
SimBank's benchmarking capabilities through experiments with various PresPM
methods across different interventions, highlighting its value as a publicly

*Shagun Maheshwari,Janghoon Ock,Adeesh Kolluru,Amir Barati Farimani,John R. Kitchin*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: This study explores the impacts of pre-training on the GemNet-T model, a graph neural network-based machine-learning force field, for ab initio molecular dynamics. Pre-training enhances simulation stability significantly, even though force MAE is comparable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations require accurate force predictions, which are computationally expensive. MLFFs such as GemNet-T can accelerate these simulations, and the study seeks to evaluate whether pre-training improves model performance and simulation stability.

Method: Two training strategies for GemNet-T were assessed: direct training on MD17 data and pre-training on OC20 data followed by fine-tuning on MD17. The stability and force error metrics of simulations were analyzed.

Result: Both approaches achieved low force MAEs (~5 meV/A per atom). However, pre-trained models sustained MD trajectories up to three times longer than those trained directly on MD17 data, indicating better simulation stability.

Conclusion: Pre-training on diverse, large-scale datasets significantly enhances MD simulation stability, demonstrating its importance over relying solely on force errors as a performance metric.

Abstract: Machine-learning force fields (MLFFs) have emerged as a promising solution
for speeding up ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, where accurate
force predictions are critical but often computationally expensive. In this
work, we employ GemNet-T, a graph neural network model, as an MLFF and
investigate two training strategies: (1) direct training on MD17 (10K samples)
without pre-training, and (2) pre-training on the large-scale OC20 dataset
followed by fine-tuning on MD17 (10K). While both approaches achieve low force
mean absolute errors (MAEs), reaching 5 meV/A per atom, we find that lower
force errors do not necessarily guarantee stable MD simulations. Notably, the
pre-trained GemNet-T model yields significantly improved simulation stability,
sustaining trajectories up to three times longer than the model trained from
scratch. These findings underscore the value of pre-training on large, diverse
datasets to capture complex molecular interactions and highlight that force MAE
alone is not always a sufficient metric of MD simulation stability.

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: The paper examines the use of GPT-4o for extracting economic narratives from newspaper articles and compares its outputs to gold-standard expert annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenges of extracting economic narratives from text, criticizing current NLP pipelines for lacking semantic depth beyond traditional tasks.

Method: They use GPT-4o to analyze articles from the Wall Street Journal and New York Times about inflation, juxtaposing its outputs with expert-annotated narratives based on a rigorous narrative framework.

Result: GPT-4o can structure valid economic narratives but underperforms compared to experts, especially with complex narratives and documents.

Conclusion: While GPT-4o shows promise in extracting structured narratives, it still lacks expert-level depth. The paper offers suggestions for future research in using LLMs for economic and social science tasks.

Abstract: As interest in economic narratives has grown in recent years, so has the
number of pipelines dedicated to extracting such narratives from texts.
Pipelines often employ a mix of state-of-the-art natural language processing
techniques, such as BERT, to tackle this task. While effective on foundational
linguistic operations essential for narrative extraction, such models lack the
deeper semantic understanding required to distinguish extracting economic
narratives from merely conducting classic tasks like Semantic Role Labeling.
Instead of relying on complex model pipelines, we evaluate the benefits of
Large Language Models (LLMs) by analyzing a corpus of Wall Street Journal and
New York Times newspaper articles about inflation. We apply a rigorous
narrative definition and compare GPT-4o outputs to gold-standard narratives
produced by expert annotators. Our results suggests that GPT-4o is capable of
extracting valid economic narratives in a structured format, but still falls
short of expert-level performance when handling complex documents and
narratives. Given the novelty of LLMs in economic research, we also provide
guidance for future work in economics and the social sciences that employs LLMs
to pursue similar objectives.

Motivation: To explore the practical advantages of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) amid skepticism about its utility due to NISQ device limitations.

Method: The authors construct and evaluate 12 QNN configurations, combining two quantum feature maps with six entanglement strategies, and test them on a wind energy dataset.

Result: QNNs using the Z feature map achieve 93% prediction accuracy in forecasting wind power output with only four input parameters.

Conclusion: QNNs demonstrate clear potential over classical methods in predictive tasks, signaling a promising future for QML in practical applications.

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is an emerging field at the intersection of
quantum computing and machine learning, aiming to enhance classical machine
learning methods by leveraging quantum mechanics principles such as
entanglement and superposition. However, skepticism persists regarding the
practical advantages of QML, mainly due to the current limitations of noisy
intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This study addresses these concerns
by extensively assessing Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs)-quantum-inspired
counterparts of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), demonstrating their
effectiveness compared to classical methods. We systematically construct and
evaluate twelve distinct QNN configurations, utilizing two unique quantum
feature maps combined with six different entanglement strategies for ansatz
design. Experiments conducted on a wind energy dataset reveal that QNNs
employing the Z feature map achieve up to 93% prediction accuracy when
forecasting wind power output using only four input parameters. Our findings
show that QNNs outperform classical methods in predictive tasks, underscoring
the potential of QML in real-world applications.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the constraints of NISQ hardware by introducing a regularization term in QML optimization, balancing gate-cutting benefits and model accuracy for larger quantum challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of NISQ hardware in circuit depth and connectivity, and enable the study of larger and complex quantum problems, this paper seeks methods to reduce sampling overhead in circuit cutting for better QML optimization.

Method: The authors propose a novel regularization term in the QML optimization process, penalizing the sampling overhead from circuit cutting, and allowing an optimization balance between cutting benefits and model accuracy.

Result: The approach successfully helps the optimization process manage trade-offs, making it feasible to explore complex quantum models while minimizing cutting inefficiencies.

Conclusion: The introduced regularization term represents a step forward in optimizing QML processes for NISQ systems, potentially facilitating quantum advantage and advancing quantum machine learning research.

Abstract: Whether QML can offer a transformative advantage remains an open question.
The severe constraints of NISQ hardware, particularly in circuit depth and
connectivity, hinder both the validation of quantum advantage and the empirical
investigation of major obstacles like barren plateaus. Circuit cutting
techniques have emerged as a strategy to execute larger quantum circuits on
smaller, less connected hardware by dividing them into subcircuits. However,
this partitioning increases the number of samples needed to estimate the
expectation value accurately through classical post-processing compared to
estimating it directly from the full circuit. This work introduces a novel
regularization term into the QML optimization process, directly penalizing the
overhead associated with sampling. We demonstrate that this approach enables
the optimizer to balance the advantages of gate cutting against the
optimization of the typical ML cost function. Specifically, it navigates the
trade-off between minimizing the cutting overhead and maintaining the overall
accuracy of the QML model, paving the way to study larger complex problems in
pursuit of quantum advantage.

*Akwasi Asare,Dennis Agyemanh Nana Gookyi,Derrick Boateng,Fortunatus Aabangbio Wulnye*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This study leverages edge AI technology for real-time diabetic retinopathy detection using deep learning models, focusing on scalability and efficiency for resource-limited settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diabetic Retinopathy is a major global health challenge due to its prevalence and the resource-intensive nature of current diagnostic methods, necessitating a cost-effective and efficient solution.

Method: The study used a curated dataset along with preprocessing techniques and trained various CNN architectures (e.g., MobileNet, SqueezeNet) with TensorFlow, optimized them for edge devices by converting to TensorFlowLite and quantizing them to 8-bit integers.

Result: MobileNet achieved 96.45% accuracy, SqueezeNet showed strong real-time performance on smaller devices, ShuffleNet and custom DNN were efficient for resource-constrained platforms.

Conclusion: Integrating edge AI into healthcare enables scalable, real-time, and accurate detection of Diabetic Retinopathy, particularly benefiting underserved and remote settings.

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), a leading cause of vision impairment in
individuals with diabetes, affects approximately 34.6% of diabetes patients
globally, with the number of cases projected to reach 242 million by 2045.
Traditional DR diagnosis relies on the manual examination of retinal fundus
images, which is both time-consuming and resource intensive. This study
presents a novel solution using Edge Impulse to deploy multiple deep learning
models for real-time DR detection on edge devices. A robust dataset of over
3,662 retinal fundus images, sourced from the Kaggle EyePACS dataset, was
curated, and enhanced through preprocessing techniques, including augmentation
and normalization. Using TensorFlow, various Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs), such as MobileNet, ShuffleNet, SqueezeNet, and a custom Deep Neural
Network (DNN), were designed, trained, and optimized for edge deployment. The
models were converted to TensorFlowLite and quantized to 8-bit integers to
reduce their size and enhance inference speed, with minimal trade-offs in
accuracy. Performance evaluations across different edge hardware platforms,
including smartphones and microcontrollers, highlighted key metrics such as
inference speed, accuracy, precision, and resource utilization. MobileNet
achieved an accuracy of 96.45%, while SqueezeNet demonstrated strong real-time
performance with a small model size of 176 KB and latency of just 17 ms on GPU.
ShuffleNet and the custom DNN achieved moderate accuracy but excelled in
resource efficiency, making them suitable for lower-end devices. This
integration of edge AI technology into healthcare presents a scalable,
cost-effective solution for early DR detection, providing timely and accurate
diagnosis, especially in resource-constrained and remote healthcare settings.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The study introduces FAHR-Face, a foundation model trained on >40 million facial images, fine-tuned for estimating biological age (FAHR-FaceAge) and predicting survival risk (FAHR-FaceSurvival). Clinical testing shows robust performance in both tasks, providing complementary prognostic information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the use of facial appearance as a noninvasive biomarker to estimate biological age and predict survival risk, specifically in cancer patients, using a foundation model trained on vast datasets.

Method: The researchers trained FAHR-Face on >40 million facial images and fine-tuned it for two tasks: biological age estimation (on 749,935 public images) and survival risk prediction (on 34,389 cancer patient photos). Robustness and independence of the models were tested, and results were clinically validated on independent datasets.

Result: FAHR-FaceAge achieved high accuracy in age estimation (mean error of 5.1 years) and outperformed prior models in survival prognostication. FAHR-FaceSurvival demonstrated strong mortality risk prediction, with significant differences between high- and low-risk groups. Both models generalized well across age, sex, race, and cancer subgroups.

Conclusion: The study shows that a single foundation model can effectively generate inexpensive and scalable facial biomarkers for biological ageing and mortality risk, providing distinct, complementary prognostic insights, and enabling training on smaller clinical datasets.

Abstract: Background: Facial appearance offers a noninvasive window into health. We
built FAHR-Face, a foundation model trained on >40 million facial images and
fine-tuned it for two distinct tasks: biological age estimation (FAHR-FaceAge)
and survival risk prediction (FAHR-FaceSurvival).
  Methods: FAHR-FaceAge underwent a two-stage, age-balanced fine-tuning on
749,935 public images; FAHR-FaceSurvival was fine-tuned on 34,389 photos of
cancer patients. Model robustness (cosmetic surgery, makeup, pose, lighting)
and independence (saliency mapping) was tested extensively. Both models were
clinically tested in two independent cancer patient datasets with survival
analyzed by multivariable Cox models and adjusted for clinical prognostic
factors.
  Findings: For age estimation, FAHR-FaceAge had the lowest mean absolute error
of 5.1 years on public datasets, outperforming benchmark models and maintaining
accuracy across the full human lifespan. In cancer patients, FAHR-FaceAge
outperformed a prior facial age estimation model in survival prognostication.
FAHR-FaceSurvival demonstrated robust prediction of mortality, and the
highest-risk quartile had more than triple the mortality of the lowest
(adjusted hazard ratio 3.22; P<0.001). These findings were validated in the
independent cohort and both models showed generalizability across age, sex,
race and cancer subgroups. The two algorithms provided distinct, complementary
prognostic information; saliency mapping revealed each model relied on distinct
facial regions. The combination of FAHR-FaceAge and FAHR-FaceSurvival improved
prognostic accuracy.
  Interpretation: A single foundation model can generate inexpensive, scalable
facial biomarkers that capture both biological ageing and disease-related
mortality risk. The foundation model enabled effective training using
relatively small clinical datasets.

*Shatha Abudalou*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This study investigates and compares the performance of transformer-based models UNETR and SwinUNETR against 3D UNet for prostate segmentation in MRI images, considering inter-reader variability and domain heterogeneity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in automatic prostate segmentation due to inter-reader variability and cross-site domain shifts by exploring if transformer models can provide better precision compared to traditional CNN models.

Method: The paper compares models under three training strategies (single cohort, cross-validated mixed cohort, and gland size-based datasets). The Dice Similarity Coefficient is the evaluation metric, hyperparameters are tuned using Optuna, and the dataset involves MRI volumes annotated by independent experts.

Result: SwinUNETR outperforms other models, achieving the highest Dice scores across single reader and mixed training strategies, especially in larger gland size-based subsets, where traditional CNN models struggled.

Conclusion: Global and shifted-window self-attention in SwinUNETR effectively reduces noise and sensitivity to imbalances, offering a robust and computationally efficient solution for prostate segmentation in clinical applications.

Abstract: Inter reader variability and cross site domain shift challenge the automatic
segmentation of prostate anatomy using T2 weighted MRI images. This study
investigates whether transformer models can retain precision amid such
heterogeneity. We compare the performance of UNETR and SwinUNETR in prostate
gland segmentation against our previous 3D UNet model [1], based on 546 MRI
(T2weighted) volumes annotated by two independent experts. Three training
strategies were analyzed: single cohort dataset, 5 fold cross validated mixed
cohort, and gland size based dataset. Hyperparameters were tuned by Optuna. The
test set, from an independent population of readers, served as the evaluation
endpoint (Dice Similarity Coefficient). In single reader training, SwinUNETR
achieved an average dice score of 0.816 for Reader#1 and 0.860 for Reader#2,
while UNETR scored 0.8 and 0.833 for Readers #1 and #2, respectively, compared
to the baseline UNets 0.825 for Reader #1 and 0.851 for Reader #2. SwinUNETR
had an average dice score of 0.8583 for Reader#1 and 0.867 for Reader#2 in
cross-validated mixed training. For the gland size-based dataset, SwinUNETR
achieved an average dice score of 0.902 for Reader#1 subset and 0.894 for
Reader#2, using the five-fold mixed training strategy (Reader#1, n=53;
Reader#2, n=87) at larger gland size-based subsets, where UNETR performed
poorly. Our findings demonstrate that global and shifted-window self-attention
effectively reduces label noise and class imbalance sensitivity, resulting in
improvements in the Dice score over CNNs by up to five points while maintaining
computational efficiency. This contributes to the high robustness of SwinUNETR
for clinical deployment.

*Paula Feldman,Miguel Fainstein,Viviana Siless,Claudio Delrieux,Emmanuel Iarussi*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Recursive variational Neural Network (RvNN) to synthesize 3D models of diverse and realistic blood vessels, leveraging generative neural networks to overcome the limitations of rule-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for generating vasculature are rule-based and fail to capture the realistic diversity and complexity of anatomical structures.

Method: The Recursive variational Neural Network (RvNN) learns the hierarchical organization of vessel branches and encodes branch connectivity and geometry features into a latent manifold, enabling geometry synthesis by sampling this latent space.

Result: RvNN generates diverse and realistic 3D blood vessel models that closely resemble real data in terms of radii, length, and tortuosity, including aneurysm datasets.

Conclusion: RvNN successfully synthesizes accurate and diverse anatomical vessel geometries, marking the first application of this approach to medical vessel generation and enabling advancements in various medical applications.

Abstract: Anatomical trees play an important role in clinical diagnosis and treatment
planning. Yet, accurately representing these structures poses significant
challenges owing to their intricate and varied topology and geometry. Most
existing methods to synthesize vasculature are rule based, and despite
providing some degree of control and variation in the structures produced, they
fail to capture the diversity and complexity of actual anatomical data. We
developed a Recursive variational Neural Network (RvNN) that fully exploits the
hierarchical organization of the vessel and learns a low-dimensional manifold
encoding branch connectivity along with geometry features describing the target
surface. After training, the RvNN latent space can be sampled to generate new
vessel geometries. By leveraging the power of generative neural networks, we
generate 3D models of blood vessels that are both accurate and diverse, which
is crucial for medical and surgical training, hemodynamic simulations, and many
other purposes. These results closely resemble real data, achieving high
similarity in vessel radii, length, and tortuosity across various datasets,
including those with aneurysms. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the
first to utilize this technique for synthesizing blood vessels.

TL;DR: The paper presents a transformer-based Mixture-of-Experts framework for integrating multi-modal MRI and clinical data, significantly boosting diagnostic accuracy in neurological disorders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DL approaches are inadequate at handling multi-modal MRI and clinical data, leading to challenges in diagnosing neurological disorders.

Method: The framework uses transformer encoders for volumetric spatial relationships, modality-specific experts for feature extraction, and adaptive gating for dynamic fusion of outputs.

Result: It achieves a validation accuracy of 82.47%, outperforming baseline methods by over 10%, showing enhanced ability to distinguish overlapping disease states.

Conclusion: The proposed approach significantly improves ND diagnosis, showcasing notable potential for real-world clinical application.

Abstract: The integration of multi-modal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and clinical
data holds great promise for enhancing the diagnosis of neurological disorders
(NDs) in real-world clinical settings. Deep Learning (DL) has recently emerged
as a powerful tool for extracting meaningful patterns from medical data to aid
in diagnosis. However, existing DL approaches struggle to effectively leverage
multi-modal MRI and clinical data, leading to suboptimal performance.
  To address this challenge, we utilize a unique, proprietary multi-modal
clinical dataset curated for ND research. Based on this dataset, we propose a
novel transformer-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework for ND
classification, leveraging multiple MRI modalities-anatomical (aMRI), Diffusion
Tensor Imaging (DTI), and functional (fMRI)-alongside clinical assessments. Our
framework employs transformer encoders to capture spatial relationships within
volumetric MRI data while utilizing modality-specific experts for targeted
feature extraction. A gating mechanism with adaptive fusion dynamically
integrates expert outputs, ensuring optimal predictive performance.
Comprehensive experiments and comparisons with multiple baselines demonstrate
that our multi-modal approach significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy,
particularly in distinguishing overlapping disease states. Our framework
achieves a validation accuracy of 82.47\%, outperforming baseline methods by
over 10\%, highlighting its potential to improve ND diagnosis by applying
multi-modal learning to real-world clinical data.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a deep learning model to classify 8 different body mpMRI series types, improving radiologist efficiency in reading exams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Technologist errors and diverse imaging protocols lead to incorrect DICOM header information for mpMRI series, creating inefficiencies for radiologists.

Method: Multiple deep learning classifiers (ResNet, EfficientNet, DenseNet-121) were trained on data from various institutions to classify MRI series. DenseNet-121 was confirmed as the best-performing model using various experimental setups.

Result: DenseNet-121 achieved an F1-score of 0.966 and accuracy of 0.972, while external datasets showed lower accuracy (0.872 and 0.810). Performance improved with larger training data quantities.

Conclusion: DenseNet-121 outperforms other models in classifying mpMRI series types accurately under varying training settings and datasets, demonstrating its utility in clinical workflows.

Abstract: Multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) exams have various series
types acquired with different imaging protocols. The DICOM headers of these
series often have incorrect information due to the sheer diversity of protocols
and occasional technologist errors. To address this, we present a deep
learning-based classification model to classify 8 different body mpMRI series
types so that radiologists read the exams efficiently. Using mpMRI data from
various institutions, multiple deep learning-based classifiers of ResNet,
EfficientNet, and DenseNet are trained to classify 8 different MRI series, and
their performance is compared. Then, the best-performing classifier is
identified, and its classification capability under the setting of different
training data quantities is studied. Also, the model is evaluated on the
out-of-training-distribution datasets. Moreover, the model is trained using
mpMRI exams obtained from different scanners in two training strategies, and
its performance is tested. Experimental results show that the DenseNet-121
model achieves the highest F1-score and accuracy of 0.966 and 0.972 over the
other classification models with p-value$<$0.05. The model shows greater than
0.95 accuracy when trained with over 729 studies of the training data, whose
performance improves as the training data quantities grew larger. On the
external data with the DLDS and CPTAC-UCEC datasets, the model yields 0.872 and
0.810 accuracy for each. These results indicate that in both the internal and
external datasets, the DenseNet-121 model attains high accuracy for the task of
classifying 8 body MRI series types.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework combining homomorphic encryption (HE) and VQGAN-based image compression to improve the efficiency of secure medical image processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to process sensitive medical imaging data securely without compromising privacy, while overcoming the computational challenges of HE for large images.

Method: HE is combined with VQGAN to compress medical images. Activation functions are approximated with lower-degree polynomials, and enhancements are made using a modified squeeze and excitation module.

Result: The framework reduces computational costs with minimal performance loss on encrypted chest X-ray datasets, demonstrating feasibility for multi-label classification tasks with standard CNN backbones.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a viable approach for secure and efficient medical image processing, balancing performance and privacy despite the relative slowness of HE inference.

Abstract: Medical imaging data contain sensitive patient information requiring strong
privacy protection. Many analytical setups require data to be sent to a server
for inference purposes. Homomorphic encryption (HE) provides a solution by
allowing computations to be performed on encrypted data without revealing the
original information. However, HE inference is computationally expensive,
particularly for large images (e.g., chest X-rays). In this study, we propose
an HE inference framework for medical images that uses VQGAN to compress images
into latent representations, thereby significantly reducing the computational
burden while preserving image quality. We approximate the activation functions
with lower-degree polynomials to balance the accuracy and efficiency in
compliance with HE requirements. We observed that a downsampling factor of
eight for compression achieved an optimal balance between performance and
computational cost. We further adapted the squeeze and excitation module, which
is known to improve traditional CNNs, to enhance the HE framework. Our method
was tested on two chest X-ray datasets for multi-label classification tasks
using vanilla CNN backbones. Although HE inference remains relatively slow and
introduces minor performance differences compared with unencrypted inference,
our approach shows strong potential for practical use in medical images

TL;DR: This paper introduces FedWSIDD, a federated learning framework for Whole Slide Image classification that uses dataset distillation for efficient communication and local model improvement while maintaining patient data privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning is essential in medical image analysis to enable collaborative model building without compromising sensitive patient data. However, WSI classification faces challenges like varying computational resources across medical institutions and privacy concerns.

Method: The proposed FedWSIDD uses dataset distillation to generate synthetic slides. These slides are aggregated on the server, distributed across institutions, and combined with original slides for local tasks. A novel dataset distillation algorithm with stain normalization tailored to histopathology datasets is introduced to enhance the quality of synthetic slides.

Result: Extensive experiments on WSI classification datasets like CAMELYON16 and CAMELYON17 show that FedWSIDD improves local classification performance, supports heterogeneous local models, and maintains patient data privacy.

Conclusion: FedWSIDD demonstrates its effectiveness in handling complex WSI classification tasks by ensuring performance improvement, privacy preservation, and adaptability to heterogeneous local models, making it a robust solution for federated learning in medical imaging.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising approach for collaborative
medical image analysis, enabling multiple institutions to build robust
predictive models while preserving sensitive patient data. In the context of
Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification, FL faces significant challenges,
including heterogeneous computational resources across participating medical
institutes and privacy concerns. To address these challenges, we propose
FedWSIDD, a novel FL paradigm that leverages dataset distillation (DD) to learn
and transmit synthetic slides. On the server side, FedWSIDD aggregates
synthetic slides from participating centres and distributes them across all
centres. On the client side, we introduce a novel DD algorithm tailored to
histopathology datasets which incorporates stain normalisation into the
distillation process to generate a compact set of highly informative synthetic
slides. These synthetic slides, rather than model parameters, are transmitted
to the server. After communication, the received synthetic slides are combined
with original slides for local tasks. Extensive experiments on multiple WSI
classification tasks, including CAMELYON16 and CAMELYON17, demonstrate that
FedWSIDD offers flexibility for heterogeneous local models, enhances local WSI
classification performance, and preserves patient privacy. This makes it a
highly effective solution for complex WSI classification tasks. The code is

*Yu Xing,Shishi Huang,Meng Lv,Guo Chen,Huailiang Wang,Lingzhi Sui*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper addresses noise problems in ultra-compact analog image sensors for single-use medical endoscopes and proposes a hybrid denoising method that enhances image quality significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle noise issues in small, single-use analog image sensors for medical endoscopes, which undermine their imaging performance despite their advantages in portability and reduced invasiveness.

Method: A comprehensive noise model was developed to understand key noise types (fixed-pattern, periodic banding, mixed Poisson-Gaussian), followed by proposing a hybrid denoising system combining traditional algorithms with advanced learning-based techniques.

Result: The hybrid system achieved effective noise reduction without loss of detail or color distortion, delivering real-time performance on FPGA platforms and improving PSNR from 21.16 to 33.05 on the test dataset.

Conclusion: Their denoising approach successfully addresses major challenges of single-use endoscopic analog sensors, paving the way for reliable diagnostic imaging with improved operational performance.

Abstract: Endoscopes featuring a miniaturized design have significantly enhanced
operational flexibility, portability, and diagnostic capability while
substantially reducing the invasiveness of medical procedures. Recently,
single-use endoscopes equipped with an ultra-compact analogue image sensor
measuring less than 1mm x 1mm bring revolutionary advancements to medical
diagnosis. They reduce the structural redundancy and large capital expenditures
associated with reusable devices, eliminate the risk of patient infections
caused by inadequate disinfection, and alleviate patient suffering. However,
the limited photosensitive area results in reduced photon capture per pixel,
requiring higher photon sensitivity settings to maintain adequate brightness.
In high-contrast medical imaging scenarios, the small-sized sensor exhibits a
constrained dynamic range, making it difficult to simultaneously capture
details in both highlights and shadows, and additional localized digital gain
is required to compensate. Moreover, the simplified circuit design and analog
signal transmission introduce additional noise sources. These factors
collectively contribute to significant noise issues in processed endoscopic
images. In this work, we developed a comprehensive noise model for analog image
sensors in medical endoscopes, addressing three primary noise types:
fixed-pattern noise, periodic banding noise, and mixed Poisson-Gaussian noise.
Building on this analysis, we propose a hybrid denoising system that
synergistically combines traditional image processing algorithms with advanced
learning-based techniques for captured raw frames from sensors. Experiments
demonstrate that our approach effectively reduces image noise without fine
detail loss or color distortion, while achieving real-time performance on FPGA
platforms and an average PSNR improvement from 21.16 to 33.05 on our test
dataset.

show that hybrid preprocessing PMD filter-CLAHE can improve the Pap smear image
quality and CNN architecture performance compared to the original images. The
maximum metric improvements are 13.62% for accuracy, 10.04% for precision,
13.08% for recall, and 14.34% for F1-score. The proposed hybrid PMD

Motivation: Accurate tumor segmentation is vital for radiotherapy optimization, but global datasets fail to capture the heterogeneity of local patient populations. Research on local datasets is essential for effective clinical deployment of AI tools.

Method: The paper introduces a hybrid UNet-Transformer model incorporating convolutional neural networks and attention modules, trained on a local MRI dataset of 6080 images. It uses efficient preprocessing, DICOM extraction, data augmentation, and pretrained ImageNet weights for enhanced model performance.

Result: The model achieved a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.764 and an IoU of 0.736 on the local dataset, showing strong performance despite limited data resources.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of developing site-specific AI models for accurate, efficient tumor segmentation to support clinical radiotherapy planning and execution.

Abstract: Cancer is an abnormal growth with potential to invade locally and metastasize
to distant organs. Accurate auto-segmentation of the tumor and surrounding
normal tissues is required for radiotherapy treatment plan optimization. Recent
AI-based segmentation models are generally trained on large public datasets,
which lack the heterogeneity of local patient populations. While these studies
advance AI-based medical image segmentation, research on local datasets is
necessary to develop and integrate AI tumor segmentation models directly into
hospital software for efficient and accurate oncology treatment planning and
execution. This study enhances tumor segmentation using computationally
efficient hybrid UNet-Transformer models on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
datasets acquired from a local hospital under strict privacy protection. We
developed a robust data pipeline for seamless DICOM extraction and
preprocessing, followed by extensive image augmentation to ensure model
generalization across diverse clinical settings, resulting in a total dataset
of 6080 images for training. Our novel architecture integrates UNet-based
convolutional neural networks with a transformer bottleneck and complementary
attention modules, including efficient attention, Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE)
blocks, Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), and ResNeXt blocks. To
accelerate convergence and reduce computational demands, we used a maximum
batch size of 8 and initialized the encoder with pretrained ImageNet weights,
training the model on dual NVIDIA T4 GPUs via checkpointing to overcome
Kaggle's runtime limits. Quantitative evaluation on the local MRI dataset
yielded a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.764 and an Intersection over Union
(IoU) of 0.736, demonstrating competitive performance despite limited data and
underscoring the importance of site-specific model development for clinical
deployment.

### [305] [Next-Generation Conflict Forecasting: Unleashing Predictive Patterns through Spatiotemporal Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14817)
*Simon P. von der Maase*

Main category: stat.OT

TL;DR: This paper presents a neural network for forecasting various types of violent conflict at high spatiotemporal resolution, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal manual data preparation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable forecasting of violent conflicts at granular levels remains a critical challenge for researchers and policymakers looking to enhance early warning systems and humanitarian efforts.

Method: The study introduces a Monte Carlo Dropout Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) U-Net architecture combining convolutional layers for spatial dependencies and recurrent structures for temporal data. The system autonomously learns spatiotemporal patterns without manual feature engineering and provides probabilistic uncertainties while forecasting.

Result: The proposed model surpasses existing approaches in predictive accuracy for violent conflict forecasting tasks, effectively quantifying forecast uncertainties while maintaining extensibility for additional data and auxiliary predictions.

Conclusion: This architecture is a significant advancement for understanding and anticipating violent conflicts, with implications for early-warning tools, humanitarian responses, and peacebuilding strategies.

Abstract: Forecasting violent conflict at high spatial and temporal resolution remains
a central challenge for both researchers and policymakers. This study presents
a novel neural network architecture for forecasting three distinct types of
violence -- state-based, non-state, and one-sided -- at the subnational
(priogrid-month) level, up to 36 months in advance. The model jointly performs
classification and regression tasks, producing both probabilistic estimates and
expected magnitudes of future events. It achieves state-of-the-art performance
across all tasks and generates approximate predictive posterior distributions
to quantify forecast uncertainty.
  The architecture is built on a Monte Carlo Dropout Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) U-Net, integrating convolutional layers to capture spatial dependencies
with recurrent structures to model temporal dynamics. Unlike many existing
approaches, it requires no manual feature engineering and relies solely on
historical conflict data. This design enables the model to autonomously learn
complex spatiotemporal patterns underlying violent conflict.
  Beyond achieving state-of-the-art predictive performance, the model is also
highly extensible: it can readily integrate additional data sources and jointly
forecast auxiliary variables. These capabilities make it a promising tool for
early warning systems, humanitarian response planning, and evidence-based
peacebuilding initiatives.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand theoretical connections and limitations of SL and CCL in optimizing recommendation systems.

Method: Conduct theoretical analysis on SL and CCL, develop a new loss function (DrRL) using Rényi-divergence in DRO, and validate through experiments.

Result: DrRL mitigates limitations of SL and CCL, improving recommendation accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: DrRL effectively generalizes SL and CCL, addressing their limitations and outperforming them in experiments.

Abstract: Loss functions play a pivotal role in optimizing recommendation models. Among
various loss functions, Softmax Loss (SL) and Cosine Contrastive Loss (CCL) are
particularly effective. Their theoretical connections and differences warrant
in-depth exploration. This work conducts comprehensive analyses of these
losses, yielding significant insights: 1) Common strengths -- both can be
viewed as augmentations of traditional losses with Distributional Robust
Optimization (DRO), enhancing robustness to distributional shifts; 2)
Respective limitations -- stemming from their use of different distribution
distance metrics in DRO optimization, SL exhibits high sensitivity to false
negative instances, whereas CCL suffers from low data utilization. To address
these limitations, this work proposes a new loss function, DrRL, which
generalizes SL and CCL by leveraging R\'enyi-divergence in DRO optimization.
DrRL incorporates the advantageous structures of both SL and CCL, and can be
demonstrated to effectively mitigate their limitations. Extensive experiments
have been conducted to validate the superiority of DrRL on both recommendation
accuracy and robustness.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of a comprehensive benchmark for fair evaluation and deeper understanding of protein foundation models, which have recently progressed but remained fragmented in evaluation practices.

Method: The authors develop PFMBench, comprising evaluations of 17 state-of-the-art models over hundreds of experiments across 38 distinct tasks within 8 protein science domains.

Result: PFMBench reveals correlations between tasks, identifies the strongest models, and provides a standardized evaluation protocol to align benchmarks in the field.

Conclusion: PFMBench contributes a unifying framework for evaluating protein foundation models, facilitating insights into model generalization and guiding future development in the field.

Abstract: This study investigates the current landscape and future directions of
protein foundation model research. While recent advancements have transformed
protein science and engineering, the field lacks a comprehensive benchmark for
fair evaluation and in-depth understanding. Since ESM-1B, numerous protein
foundation models have emerged, each with unique datasets and methodologies.
However, evaluations often focus on limited tasks tailored to specific models,
hindering insights into broader generalization and limitations. Specifically,
researchers struggle to understand the relationships between tasks, assess how
well current models perform across them, and determine the criteria in
developing new foundation models. To fill this gap, we present PFMBench, a
comprehensive benchmark evaluating protein foundation models across 38 tasks
spanning 8 key areas of protein science. Through hundreds of experiments on 17
state-of-the-art models across 38 tasks, PFMBench reveals the inherent
correlations between tasks, identifies top-performing models, and provides a

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address artifacts and distortions in MRI images caused by errors in gradient trajectories, a problem prevalent in non-Cartesian imaging sequences where imperfect gradient waveforms degrade image quality.

Method: The authors measured training gradient waveforms from a small animal imaging system and used these to train a temporal convolutional network to predict the gradient distortions.

Result: The network successfully predicted nonlinear gradient distortions, and its integration into the image reconstruction process improved image quality and diffusion parameter mapping compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Temporal convolutional networks offer a more accurate modeling of gradient system distortions than linear methods and can be used to retrospectively correct gradient errors in MRI.

Abstract: Summary: Errors in gradient trajectories introduce significant artifacts and
distortions in magnetic resonance images, particularly in non-Cartesian imaging
sequences, where imperfect gradient waveforms can greatly reduce image quality.
Purpose: Our objective is to develop a general, nonlinear gradient system model
that can accurately predict gradient distortions using convolutional networks.
Methods: A set of training gradient waveforms were measured on a small animal
imaging system, and used to train a temporal convolutional network to predict
the gradient waveforms produced by the imaging system. Results: The trained
network was able to accurately predict nonlinear distortions produced by the
gradient system. Network prediction of gradient waveforms was incorporated into
the image reconstruction pipeline and provided improvements in image quality
and diffusion parameter mapping compared to both the nominal gradient waveform
and the gradient impulse response function. Conclusion: Temporal convolutional
networks can more accurately model gradient system behavior than existing
linear methods and may be used to retrospectively correct gradient errors.

*Jaehong Chung,Michael Manga,Timothy Kneafsey,Tapan Mukerji,Mengsu Hu*

Main category: physics.geo-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a transformer-based deep learning model for forecasting microearthquake (MEQ) metrics during subsurface fluid injection, with high predictive accuracy demonstrated on the EGS Collab Experiment 1 dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve seismic-risk assessment and optimize geo-engineering operations like geothermal energy extraction and CO2 sequestration by accurately forecasting the spatiotemporal evolution of microearthquakes (MEQs) caused by fluid injection.

Method: A transformer-based deep learning model is developed to forecast MEQ-related metrics (cumulative count, seismic moment, and percentile extents of MEQ cloud) using hydraulic stimulation history and past MEQ observations. Uncertainty estimates are integrated into the predictions.

Result: The model achieves $R^2 >0.98$ for 1-second forecasts and $R^2 >0.88$ for 15-second forecasts on the EGS Collab Experiment 1 dataset, providing accurate forecasts along with uncertainty quantification.

Conclusion: The proposed model demonstrates strong potential for real-time monitoring and inference of fracture and permeability evolution in subsurface reservoirs, presenting deep learning as a valuable tool for seismic-risk assessment and mitigation in fluid-injection operations.

Abstract: Microearthquakes (MEQs) generated by subsurface fluid injection record the
evolving stress state and permeability of reservoirs. Forecasting their full
spatiotemporal evolution is therefore critical for applications such as
enhanced geothermal systems (EGS), CO$_2$ sequestration and other
geo-engineering applications. We present a transformer-based deep learning
model that ingests hydraulic stimulation history and prior MEQ observations to
forecast four key quantities: cumulative MEQ count, cumulative logarithmic
seismic moment, and the 50th- and 95th-percentile extents ($P_{50}, P_{95}$) of
the MEQ cloud. Applied to the EGS Collab Experiment 1 dataset, the model
achieves $R^2 >0.98$ for the 1-second forecast horizon and $R^2 >0.88$ for the
15-second forecast horizon across all targets, and supplies uncertainty
estimates through a learned standard deviation term. These accurate,
uncertainty-quantified forecasts enable real-time inference of fracture
propagation and permeability evolution, demonstrating the strong potential of
deep-learning approaches to improve seismic-risk assessment and guide
mitigation strategies in future fluid-injection operations.

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: The paper introduces BMFM-RNA, a modular framework for training and benchmarking transcriptomic foundation models (TFMs), and proposes a novel training objective (WCED). The framework achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple datasets and promotes systematic exploration of TFM strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The diversity in TFM implementations and training strategies makes it difficult to evaluate the impact of individual design choices, preventing convergence on best practices and limiting reproducibility.

Method: The authors developed BMFM-RNA, an open-source framework unifying different training strategies for TFMs, including a proposed novel training objective called WCED. They benchmarked four model checkpoints using different combinations of training approaches, such as MLM and WCED.

Result: Models trained with the WCED objective matched or exceeded the performance of state-of-the-art models like scGPT across more than twelve datasets, demonstrating effectiveness in zero-shot and fine-tuning tasks.

Conclusion: BMFM-RNA provides a reproducible and flexible foundation for benchmarking and exploring optimal TFM strategies, enhancing the development of advanced tools for genomic and transcriptomic analysis.

Abstract: Transcriptomic foundation models (TFMs) have recently emerged as powerful
tools for analyzing gene expression in cells and tissues, supporting key tasks
such as cell-type annotation, batch correction, and perturbation prediction.
However, the diversity of model implementations and training strategies across
recent TFMs, though promising, makes it challenging to isolate the contribution
of individual design choices or evaluate their potential synergies. This
hinders the field's ability to converge on best practices and limits the
reproducibility of insights across studies. We present BMFM-RNA, an
open-source, modular software package that unifies diverse TFM pretraining and
fine-tuning objectives within a single framework. Leveraging this capability,
we introduce a novel training objective, whole cell expression decoder (WCED),
which captures global expression patterns using an autoencoder-like CLS
bottleneck representation. In this paper, we describe the framework, supported
input representations, and training objectives. We evaluated four model
checkpoints pretrained on CELLxGENE using combinations of masked language
modeling (MLM), WCED and multitask learning. Using the benchmarking
capabilities of BMFM-RNA, we show that WCED-based models achieve performance
that matches or exceeds state-of-the-art approaches like scGPT across more than
a dozen datasets in both zero-shot and fine-tuning tasks. BMFM-RNA, available
as part of the biomed-multi-omics project (
https://github.com/BiomedSciAI/biomed-multi-omic ), offers a reproducible
foundation for systematic benchmarking and community-driven exploration of
optimal TFM training strategies, enabling the development of more effective

### [311] [DEFORMER: Coupling Deformed Localized Patterns with Global Context for Robust End-to-end Speech Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01732)
*Jiamin Xie,John H. L. Hansen*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This paper introduces the "Deformer," a modification to the Conformer architecture using deformable CNNs to improve speech recognition. The proposed architecture significantly improves word error rate (WER) on the WSJ eval92 dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper investigates whether using asymmetric kernels in CNNs, instead of rigid and symmetric ones, can better capture localized time-frequency patterns in speech recognition tasks.

Method: The study replaces depthwise CNNs in the Conformer architecture with deformable CNNs and visualizes learned local receptive fields and attention maps. A statistical analysis of kernel offsets is conducted and half of the encoder layers were adapted to use the Deformer.

Result: The Deformer yields a +5.6% relative WER improvement without a language model (LM) and +6.4% relative WER improvement with a LM over the Conformer baseline on the WSJ eval92 dataset.

Conclusion: The Deformer enhances speech recognition performance by effectively learning both local and global features through deformable CNNs, offering better feature associations and significant accuracy improvements.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have improved speech recognition
performance greatly by exploiting localized time-frequency patterns. But these
patterns are assumed to appear in symmetric and rigid kernels by the
conventional CNN operation. It motivates the question: What about asymmetric
kernels? In this study, we illustrate adaptive views can discover local
features which couple better with attention than fixed views of the input. We
replace depthwise CNNs in the Conformer architecture with a deformable
counterpart, dubbed this "Deformer". By analyzing our best-performing model, we
visualize both local receptive fields and global attention maps learned by the
Deformer and show increased feature associations on the utterance level. The
statistical analysis of learned kernel offsets provides an insight into the
change of information in features with the network depth. Finally, replacing
only half of the layers in the encoder, the Deformer improves +5.6% relative
WER without a LM and +6.4% relative WER with a LM over the Conformer baseline
on the WSJ eval92 set.

*Jiamin Xie,Ke Li,Jinxi Guo,Andros Tjandra,Yuan Shangguan,Leda Sari,Chunyang Wu,Junteng Jia,Jay Mahadeokar,Ozlem Kalinli*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to prune multilingual ASR models using adaptive masking, resulting in sparse monolingual or multilingual models with less performance loss and fewer training iterations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multilingual ASR model pruning methods require multiple pruning and re-training cycles per language, making them inefficient.

Method: An adaptive masking approach is proposed to dynamically adjust sub-networks either for sparse monolingual models or sparse multilingual models (Dynamic ASR Pathways).

Result: The method achieves better performance for sparse monolingual models compared to existing pruning techniques and discovers optimal sub-networks in multilingual models without language-specific pruning.

Conclusion: The adaptive masking approach enables more efficient multilingual ASR model pruning with reduced training iterations and improved performance.

Abstract: Neural network pruning offers an effective method for compressing a
multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) model with minimal performance
loss. However, it entails several rounds of pruning and re-training needed to
be run for each language. In this work, we propose the use of an adaptive
masking approach in two scenarios for pruning a multilingual ASR model
efficiently, each resulting in sparse monolingual models or a sparse
multilingual model (named as Dynamic ASR Pathways). Our approach dynamically
adapts the sub-network, avoiding premature decisions about a fixed sub-network
structure. We show that our approach outperforms existing pruning methods when
targeting sparse monolingual models. Further, we illustrate that Dynamic ASR
Pathways jointly discovers and trains better sub-networks (pathways) of a
single multilingual model by adapting from different sub-network
initializations, thereby reducing the need for language-specific pruning.

TL;DR: The authors present MixRep, a novel data augmentation method for low-resource Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), that shows significant improvements in performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of improving low-resource ASR by proposing an enhanced data augmentation technique.

Method: Developed MixRep, which mixes hidden neural network representations and integrates regularization along the time axis, demonstrating its complementary benefits. Tested the method in a Conformer encoder with joint CTC loss.

Result: MixRep consistently outperforms traditional regularization methods and yields significant improvements in Word Error Rate (WER), outperforming a strong SpecAugment baseline.

Conclusion: MixRep is a simple and effective approach for improving ASR performance in low-resource settings.

Abstract: In this paper, we present MixRep, a simple and effective data augmentation
strategy based on mixup for low-resource ASR. MixRep interpolates the feature
dimensions of hidden representations in the neural network that can be applied
to both the acoustic feature input and the output of each layer, which
generalizes the previous MixSpeech method. Further, we propose to combine the
mixup with a regularization along the time axis of the input, which is shown as
complementary. We apply MixRep to a Conformer encoder of an E2E LAS
architecture trained with a joint CTC loss. We experiment on the WSJ dataset
and subsets of the SWB dataset, covering reading and telephony conversational
speech. Experimental results show that MixRep consistently outperforms other
regularization methods for low-resource ASR. Compared to a strong SpecAugment
baseline, MixRep achieves a +6.5\% and a +6.7\% relative WER reduction on the
eval92 set and the Callhome part of the eval'2000 set.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigating how Speech LLMs can process multi-channel audio with spatial cues to enhance speech recognition and localization capabilities.

Method: The authors proposed two techniques: serialized directional output training (S-DOT) and contrastive direction data augmentation (CDDA) to improve the model's spatial audio understanding and directional capabilities.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate the approach's effectiveness in connecting textual cues with spatial audio and achieving high performance in speech recognition and source localization.

Conclusion: Directional-SpeechLlama advances Speech LLMs towards integrating spatial cues, offering enhanced directional speech recognition and audio processing capabilities.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that prompting large language models (LLM)
with audio encodings enables effective speech recognition capabilities.
However, the ability of Speech LLMs to comprehend and process multi-channel
audio with spatial cues remains a relatively uninvestigated area of research.
In this work, we present directional-SpeechLlama, a novel approach that
leverages the microphone array of smart glasses to achieve directional speech
recognition, source localization, and bystander cross-talk suppression. To
enhance the model's ability to understand directivity, we propose two key
techniques: serialized directional output training (S-DOT) and contrastive
direction data augmentation (CDDA). Experimental results show that our proposed
directional-SpeechLlama effectively captures the relationship between textual
cues and spatial audio, yielding strong performance in both speech recognition

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified speech coding model that captures both acoustic and high-level linguistic features for better performance in speech-related tasks.

Method: The authors designed HAC with three linguistic levels (acoustic, phonetic, lexical) factorized within the model using knowledge distillation from HuBERT and LaBSE pre-trained encoders.

Result: HAC successfully disentangled linguistic tokens into phonemes and word semantics, with superior reconstruction quality and interpretability, outperforming baseline methods.

Conclusion: HAC demonstrates its potential as a comprehensive discrete speech representation model, combining acoustic precision with linguistic meaning for diverse speech applications.

Abstract: We propose Hierarchical Audio Codec (HAC), a unified neural speech codec that
factorizes its bottleneck into three linguistic levels-acoustic, phonetic, and
lexical-within a single model. HAC leverages two knowledge distillation
objectives: one from a pre-trained speech encoder (HuBERT) for phoneme-level
structure, and another from a text-based encoder (LaBSE) for lexical cues.
Experiments on English and multilingual data show that HAC's factorized
bottleneck yields disentangled token sets: one aligns with phonemes, while
another captures word-level semantics. Quantitative evaluations confirm that
HAC tokens preserve naturalness and provide interpretable linguistic
information, outperforming single-level baselines in both disentanglement and
reconstruction quality. These findings underscore HAC's potential as a unified
discrete speech representation, bridging acoustic detail and lexical meaning
for downstream speech generation and understanding tasks.

*Anne Gagneux,Mathurin Massias,Emmanuel Soubies*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper explores sparsity in signal recovery by introducing sorted nonsmooth penalties for variable grouping, focusing on their computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing sparse signal recovery with dynamic grouping in generalized linear models using sorted penalties.

Method: Examined sorted nonconvex penalties and developed efficient algorithms for computing their proximal operator, including weakly convex (using PAV algorithm) and nonconvex cases (modified PAV algorithm).

Result: Efficient computation of proximal operators for sorted penalties, offering theoretical insights and experimental validation.

Conclusion: Sorted nonsmooth penalties provide effective grouping and sparse recovery; efficient computational methods are validated theoretically and experimentally.

Abstract: This work studies the problem of sparse signal recovery with automatic
grouping of variables. To this end, we investigate sorted nonsmooth penalties
as a regularization approach for generalized linear models. We focus on a
family of sorted nonconvex penalties which generalizes the Sorted L1 Norm
(SLOPE). These penalties are designed to promote clustering of variables due to
their sorted nature, while the nonconvexity reduces the shrinkage of
coefficients. Our goal is to provide efficient ways to compute their proximal
operator, enabling the use of popular proximal algorithms to solve composite
optimization problems with this choice of sorted penalties. We distinguish
between two classes of problems: the weakly convex case where computing the
proximal operator remains a convex problem, and the nonconvex case where
computing the proximal operator becomes a challenging nonconvex combinatorial
problem. For the weakly convex case (e.g. sorted MCP and SCAD), we explain how
the Pool Adjacent Violators (PAV) algorithm can exactly compute the proximal
operator. For the nonconvex case (e.g. sorted Lq with q in ]0,1[), we show that
a slight modification of this algorithm turns out to be remarkably efficient to
tackle the computation of the proximal operator. We also present new
theoretical insights on the minimizers of the nonconvex proximal problem. We
demonstrate the practical interest of using such penalties on several
experiments.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper introduces two algorithms, MT-GS and AMT-GS, for distributed optimization with improved communication efficiency and optimal convergence rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing distributed optimization problems with non-smooth objectives while optimizing communication efficiency and computation costs.

Method: A block-decomposable primal-dual framework and a multi-timescale variant of the sliding method are used to allow different subsets of agents to communicate at varying user-defined rates.

Result: Complexity analysis reveals these methods achieve optimal dependencies on solution accuracy ($\epsilon$) with reduced communication rounds and subgradient steps.

Conclusion: The results answer an open question, proving that linear communication dependency on similarity measures is achievable even for non-smooth objectives.

Abstract: We propose two first-order methods for convex, non-smooth, distributed
optimization problems, hereafter called Multi-Timescale Gradient Sliding
(MT-GS) and its accelerated variant (AMT-GS). Our MT-GS and AMT-GS can take
advantage of similarities between (local) objectives to reduce the
communication rounds, are flexible so that different subsets (of agents) can
communicate at different, user-picked rates, and are fully deterministic. These
three desirable features are achieved through a block-decomposable primal-dual
formulation, and a multi-timescale variant of the sliding method introduced in
Lan et al. (2020), Lan (2016), where different dual blocks are updated at
potentially different rates.
  To find an $\epsilon$-suboptimal solution, the complexities of our algorithms
achieve optimal dependency on $\epsilon$: MT-GS needs
$O(\overline{r}A/\epsilon)$ communication rounds and
$O(\overline{r}/\epsilon^2)$ subgradient steps for Lipchitz objectives, and
AMT-GS needs $O(\overline{r}A/\sqrt{\epsilon\mu})$ communication rounds and
$O(\overline{r}/(\epsilon\mu))$ subgradient steps if the objectives are also
$\mu$-strongly convex. Here, $\overline{r}$ measures the ``average rate of
updates'' for dual blocks, and $A$ measures similarities between (subgradients
of) local functions. In addition, the linear dependency of communication rounds
on $A$ is optimal (Arjevani and Shamir 2015), thereby providing a positive
answer to the open question whether such dependency is achievable for
non-smooth objectives (Arjevani and Shamir 2015).

TL;DR: The paper extends the trajectory GOSPA metric to include track-level uncertainties, providing better evaluation for multi-object tracking algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve evaluation metrics for multi-object tracking algorithms by incorporating uncertainties in trajectory estimates.

Method: Developed an extended version of probabilistic GOSPA metric, formulated as a multidimensional assignment problem with polynomial-time computable linear programming relaxation.

Result: The enhanced metric is interpretable and effective, as evidenced by a simulation study which demonstrated its applicability and utility.

Conclusion: The proposed metric successfully incorporates existence and state estimation uncertainties, offering a comprehensive assessment tool for multi-object tracking algorithms.

Abstract: This paper presents a generalization of the trajectory general optimal
sub-pattern assignment (GOSPA) metric for evaluating multi-object tracking
algorithms that provide trajectory estimates with track-level uncertainties.
This metric builds on the recently introduced probabilistic GOSPA metric to
account for both the existence and state estimation uncertainties of individual
object states. Similar to trajectory GOSPA (TGOSPA), it can be formulated as a
multidimensional assignment problem, and its linear programming
relaxation--also a valid metric--is computable in polynomial time.
Additionally, this metric retains the interpretability of TGOSPA, and we show
that its decomposition yields intuitive costs terms associated to expected
localization error and existence probability mismatch error for properly
detected objects, expected missed and false detection error, and track switch
error. The effectiveness of the proposed metric is demonstrated through a
simulation study.

### [319] [Omnidirectional Video Super-Resolution using Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14803)
*Arbind Agrahari Baniya,Tsz-Kwan Lee,Peter W. Eklund,Sunil Aryal*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: The paper tackles limitations in 360° video resolution quality by proposing a novel deep learning model, S3PO, addressing distortion issues specific to spherical signals. It introduces a new dataset (360VDS) and demonstrates improved performance over existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 360° videos provide immersive experiences but suffer from visual quality limitations due to low resolution and distortion in equirectangular projections. Addressing these problems is crucial for improving VR applications.

Method: The paper introduces S3PO, a deep learning model designed for 360° Video Super-Resolution. It employs recurrent modeling with attention mechanisms, a purpose-built feature extractor, and a novel loss function targeting spherical distortions. Additionally, a new dataset (360VDS) was developed.

Result: S3PO exhibits superior performance over state-of-the-art conventional VSR models and specialized 360° super-resolution models. The results are validated through a step-by-step ablation study to assess the impact of architectural sub-components.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates that purposeful design, including specific architecture and dataset creation, can successfully address distortion and resolution issues in 360° videos, pushing the boundaries of immersive VR technologies.

Abstract: Omnidirectional Videos (or 360{\deg} videos) are widely used in Virtual
Reality (VR) to facilitate immersive and interactive viewing experiences.
However, the limited spatial resolution in 360{\deg} videos does not allow for
each degree of view to be represented with adequate pixels, limiting the visual
quality offered in the immersive experience. Deep learning Video
Super-Resolution (VSR) techniques used for conventional videos could provide a
promising software-based solution; however, these techniques do not tackle the
distortion present in equirectangular projections of 360{\deg} video signals.
An additional obstacle is the limited availability of 360{\deg} video datasets
for study. To address these issues, this paper creates a novel 360{\deg} Video
Dataset (360VDS) with a study of the extensibility of conventional VSR models
to 360{\deg} videos. This paper further proposes a novel deep learning model
for 360{\deg} Video Super-Resolution (360{\deg} VSR), called Spherical Signal
Super-resolution with a Proportioned Optimisation (S3PO). S3PO adopts recurrent
modelling with an attention mechanism, unbound from conventional VSR techniques
like alignment. With a purpose-built feature extractor and a novel loss
function addressing spherical distortion, S3PO outperforms most
state-of-the-art conventional VSR models and 360{\deg}~specific
super-resolution models on 360{\deg} video datasets. A step-wise ablation study
is presented to understand and demonstrate the impact of the chosen
architectural sub-components, targeted training and optimisation.

TL;DR: The study enhances the Local Deadline Partition (LDP) algorithm by employing CNN-based dynamic priority prediction to improve interference coordination in industrial wireless networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the communication quality in large-scale industrial wireless networks for ultra-reliable, low-latency communications (URLLC).

Method: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and graph coloring are utilized to dynamically assign link priorities based on real-time conditions, unlike the static priorities in the original LDP algorithm.

Result: The CNN-based approach achieved significant gains in Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR), demonstrating improvements of up to 113%, 94%, and 49% in various network configurations through simulations.

Conclusion: The proposed method significantly enhances resource allocation, network capacity, SINR, and schedulability, proving its effectiveness for complex URLLC scenarios.

Abstract: Ensuring packet-level communication quality is vital for ultra-reliable,
low-latency communications (URLLC) in large-scale industrial wireless networks.
We enhance the Local Deadline Partition (LDP) algorithm by introducing a
CNN-based dynamic priority prediction mechanism for improved interference
coordination in multi-cell, multi-channel networks. Unlike LDP's static
priorities, our approach uses a Convolutional Neural Network and graph coloring
to adaptively assign link priorities based on real-time traffic, transmission
opportunities, and network conditions. Assuming that first training phase is
performed offline, our approach introduced minimal overhead, while enabling
more efficient resource allocation, boosting network capacity, SINR, and
schedulability. Simulation results show SINR gains of up to 113\%, 94\%, and
49\% over LDP across three network configurations, highlighting its
effectiveness for complex URLLC scenarios.

Motivation: To address the challenges of interference coordination in URLLC networks with dynamic and complex traffic, which the static-priority approach of LDP fails to manage effectively.

Method: The paper integrates a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) with a Deep Q-Network (DQN) into a reinforcement learning model. The GCN captures spatial dependencies, while the DQN leverages reward-guided exploration for adaptive scheduling and dynamic link prioritization.

Result: Simulation results show substantial mean SINR improvements (179.6%-197.4% over LDP and 31.5%-84.7% over a prior CNN-based approach) under various network configurations.

Conclusion: The proposed GCN-DQN model effectively enhances network performance, meeting URLLC requirements with minimal overhead and achieving superior interference coordination.

*Clément Yvernes,Charles K. Assaad,Emilie Devijver,Eric Gaussier*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper addresses whether interventions' effects in time series can be determined from observational data using summary causal graphs, focusing on backdoor conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if the effects of interventions can be identified purely through observational data in time series, even with summarized causal graph information.

Method: The study analyzes the conditions for identifiability via a common backdoor set and provides algorithms with limited complexity for deciding identifiability.

Result: The paper establishes conditions under which a common backdoor set exists in time series, with or without consistency over time. Algorithms are proposed to assess identifiability.

Conclusion: Identifiability of interventions effects in time series under summary causal graphs is achievable under specific conditions, and practical algorithmic solutions exist for verification.

Abstract: The identifiability problem for interventions aims at assessing whether the
total effect of some given interventions can be written with a do-free formula,
and thus be computed from observational data only. We study this problem,
considering multiple interventions and multiple effects, in the context of time
series when only abstractions of the true causal graph in the form of summary
causal graphs are available. We focus in this study on identifiability by a
common backdoor set, and establish, for time series with and without
consistency throughout time, conditions under which such a set exists. We also
provide algorithms of limited complexity to decide whether the problem is
identifiable or not.

*Luigi Sibille,Torodd Skjerve Nord,Alice Cicirello*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: The study uses Gaussian Process Latent Force Model (GPLFM) for virtual sensing and Digital Twin development of ferry quays, addressing challenges of unknown impact characteristics, sparse sensors, and boundary conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ferry quays deteriorate quickly due to harsh environments and ferry impacts, necessitating reliable structural health monitoring and assessment methods.

Method: The research integrates experimental ferry impact data and a reduced-order structural model using a Physics-Encoded Machine Learning technique with the GPLFM to estimate response forces.

Result: The GPLFM provided accurate acceleration response estimates despite uncertainties, though lower accuracy was noted near impact zones. Numerical studies identified optimal sensor placement strategies.

Conclusion: GPLFM-based methods are effective for virtual sensing and accommodating uncertainties in ferry quay monitoring, offering a valuable pathway for Digital Twin development.

Abstract: Ferry quays experience rapid deterioration due to their exposure to harsh
maritime environments and ferry impacts. Vibration-based structural health
monitoring offers a valuable approach to assessing structural integrity and
understanding the structural implications of these impacts. However, practical
limitations often restrict sensor placement at critical locations.
Consequently, virtual sensing techniques become essential for establishing a
Digital Twin and estimating the structural response. This study investigates
the application of the Gaussian Process Latent Force Model (GPLFM) for virtual
sensing on the Magerholm ferry quay, combining in-operation experimental data
collected during a ferry impact with a detailed physics-based model. The
proposed Physics-Encoded Machine Learning model integrates a reduced-order
structural model with a data-driven GPLFM representing the unknown impact
forces via their modal contributions. Significant challenges are addressed for
the development of the Digital Twin of the ferry quay, including unknown impact
characteristics (location, direction, intensity), time-varying boundary
conditions, and sparse sensor configurations. Results show that the GPLFM
provides accurate acceleration response estimates at most locations, even under
simplifying modeling assumptions such as linear time-invariant behavior during
the impact phase. Lower accuracy was observed at locations in the impact zone.
A numerical study was conducted to explore an optimal real-world sensor
placement strategy using a Backward Sequential Sensor Placement approach.
Sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine the influence of sensor types,
sampling frequencies, and incorrectly assumed damping ratios. The results
suggest that the GP latent forces can help accommodate modeling and measurement
uncertainties, maintaining acceptable estimation accuracy across scenarios.

Main category: math.MG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel boundary-weighted operator designed for hierarchical graphs by leveraging geometric properties, enabling effective graph signal processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional graph filters struggle with tree-like branching patterns in hierarchical graphs, necessitating new approaches.

Method: The method involves a boundary-weighted operator using Busemann functions on delta-hyperbolic networks to rescale graph edges and establish a curvature-controlled signal energy loss.

Result: A closed-form upper bound on the spectral norm is derived, showcasing curvature-induced energy dissipation per signal pass.

Conclusion: The lightweight operator provides stable filtering based on geometric principles, enhancing graph signal processing tools for hierarchical data.

Abstract: Hierarchical graphs often exhibit tree-like branching patterns, a structural
property that challenges the design of traditional graph filters. We introduce
a boundary-weighted operator that rescales each edge according to how far its
endpoints drift toward the graph's Gromov boundary. Using Busemann functions on
delta-hyperbolic networks, we prove a closed-form upper bound on the operator's
spectral norm: every signal loses a curvature-controlled fraction of its energy
at each pass. The result delivers a parameter-free, lightweight filter whose
stability follows directly from geometric first principles, offering a new
analytic tool for graph signal processing on data with dense or hidden
hierarchical structure.

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper introduces an accelerated version of the Sinkhorn algorithm for computing Entropic Optimal Transport, addressing slow convergence issues as regularization weakens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in overcoming the exponential slowdown of Sinkhorn algorithm convergence when regularization diminishes.

Method: The paper employs spectral analysis to understand the behavior of the Hessian and introduces a spectral warm-start strategy.

Result: Numerical experiments demonstrate faster convergence compared to the standard Sinkhorn algorithm.

Conclusion: The proposed enhancement effectively mitigates slow convergence in the Sinkhorn algorithm, making Entropic Optimal Transport computations more efficient.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an accelerated version for the Sinkhorn algorithm,
which is the reference method for computing the solution to Entropic Optimal
Transport.
  Its main draw-back is the exponential slow-down of convergence as the
regularization weakens $\varepsilon \rightarrow 0$.
  Thanks to spectral insights on the behavior of the Hessian, we propose to
mitigate the problem via an original spectral warm-start strategy. This leads
to faster convergence compared to the reference method, as also demonstrated in
our numerical experiments.

*Oluwadamilola Fasina,Ruben V. C. Pohle,Pei-Chun Su,Ronald R. Coifman*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: This paper explores the intrinsic and extrinsic organization of self-attention in transformers, using paradifferential calculus and tensor partitioning methodologies for theoretical and empirical insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to understand the structural organization of self-attention in transformers to enhance interpretability and enable practical applications such as model pruning and architecture comparison.

Method: The paper uses paradifferential calculus to theoretically analyze the invariance of self-attention mechanisms while leveraging hierarchical tensor partitioning to study geometric regularity and network sparsity.

Result: The findings highlight hierarchical organization in transformers, enabling both qualitative visualizations and quantitative measures of sparsity. Computational examples validate these insights using vision and language transformers.

Conclusion: The research advances interpretability analysis and demonstrates practical applications like network pruning and architecture evaluation through hierarchical organization and structural insights into the self-attention mechanism.

Abstract: We examine the intrinsic (within the attention head) and extrinsic (amongst
the attention heads) structure of the self-attention mechanism in transformers.
Theoretical evidence for invariance of the self-attention mechanism to softmax
activation is obtained by appealing to paradifferential calculus, (and is
supported by computational examples), which relies on the intrinsic
organization of the attention heads. Furthermore, we use an existing
methodology for hierarchical organization of tensors to examine network
structure by constructing hierarchal partition trees with respect to the query,
key, and head axes of network 3-tensors. Such an organization is consequential
since it allows one to profitably execute common signal processing tasks on a
geometry where the organized network 3-tensors exhibit regularity. We exemplify
this qualitatively, by visualizing the hierarchical organization of the tree
comprised of attention heads and the diffusion map embeddings, and
quantitatively by investigating network sparsity with the expansion
coefficients of individual attention heads and the entire network with respect
to the bi and tri-haar bases (respectively) on the space of queries, keys, and
heads of the network. To showcase the utility of our theoretical and
methodological findings, we provide computational examples using vision and
language transformers. The ramifications of these findings are two-fold: (1) a
subsequent step in interpretability analysis is theoretically admitted, and can
be exploited empirically for downstream interpretability tasks (2) one can use
the network 3-tensor organization for empirical network applications such as
model pruning (by virtue of network sparsity) and network architecture
comparison.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the inaccuracy and inefficiency of existing methods like the power method in estimating the spectral norm of matrices, especially for those with fast-decaying spectra commonly found in deep learning.

Method: They propose a Counterbalance estimator with a theoretically backed probabilistic guarantee to counter underestimation and improve matrix spectral norm estimation.

Result: The Counterbalance estimator achieves tighter upper bounds on the spectral norm compared to the power method in experiments using both synthetic and real-world data.

Conclusion: This method proves particularly effective for matrices with fast-decaying spectra, suggesting significant advantages in domains like inverse problems and deep learning.

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the spectral norm of a matrix using
only matrix-vector products. We propose a new Counterbalance estimator that
provides upper bounds on the norm and derive probabilistic guarantees on its
underestimation. Compared to standard approaches such as the power method, the
proposed estimator produces significantly tighter upper bounds in both
synthetic and real-world settings. Our method is especially effective for
matrices with fast-decaying spectra, such as those arising in deep learning and
inverse problems.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel generative modeling framework leveraging thermodynamic systems governed by Langevin dynamics for synthesizing structured data from noise, contrasting conventional neural network-based diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore an alternative pathway for generative modeling that minimizes heat emissions and utilizes inherent physical dynamics, rather than artificial noise injection or neural network-based denoising.

Method: The dynamics of thermodynamic systems are utilized to encode information for structure generation. Training is based on maximizing the probability of reversing a noising trajectory, aligning the system’s evolution with minimal heat emission.

Result: The approach is demonstrated within a digital simulation of a thermodynamic computer, showing its potential to autonomously produce structured data.

Conclusion: This framework offers an innovative method for generative modeling with potential applications in hardware implementations, reducing reliance on artificial noise and active control mechanisms for denoising.

Abstract: We introduce a generative modeling framework for thermodynamic computing, in
which structured data is synthesized from noise by the natural time evolution
of a physical system governed by Langevin dynamics. While conventional
diffusion models use neural networks to perform denoising, here the information
needed to generate structure from noise is encoded by the dynamics of a
thermodynamic system. Training proceeds by maximizing the probability with
which the computer generates the reverse of a noising trajectory, which ensures
that the computer generates data with minimal heat emission. We demonstrate
this framework within a digital simulation of a thermodynamic computer. If
realized in analog hardware, such a system would function as a generative model
that produces structured samples without the need for artificially-injected
noise or active control of denoising.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel design optimization method that reduces vibrations in plate-like structures through guided placement of beadings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address vibrations contributing to noise in engineering systems and improve passenger comfort.

Method: Combines a guided flow matching model with a surrogate model, focusing on manufacturable and low-vibration solutions without manually defining design parameters.

Result: The approach outperforms random search, a heuristic, and genetic optimization by producing diverse, manufacturable designs with lower vibrations.

Conclusion: This method facilitates broader exploration of design spaces and shows promising results for highly tailored low-noise structures.

Abstract: Structural vibrations are a source of unwanted noise in engineering systems
like cars, trains or airplanes. Minimizing these vibrations is crucial for
improving passenger comfort. This work presents a novel design optimization
approach based on guided flow matching for reducing vibrations by placing
beadings (indentations) in plate-like structures. Our method integrates a
generative flow matching model and a surrogate model trained to predict
structural vibrations. During the generation process, the flow matching model
pushes towards manufacturability while the surrogate model pushes to
low-vibration solutions. The flow matching model and its training data
implicitly define the design space, enabling a broader exploration of potential
solutions as no optimization of manually-defined design parameters is required.
We apply our method to a range of differentiable optimization objectives,
including direct optimization of specific eigenfrequencies through careful
construction of the objective function. Results demonstrate that our method
generates diverse and manufacturable plate designs with reduced structural
vibrations compared to designs from random search, a criterion-based design
heuristic and genetic optimization. The code and data are available from

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance music databases and advance music AI research through detailed, accurate music captions that incorporate both low-level acoustic and high-level musical attributes.

Method: The method involves a projection-based architecture that transforms audio inputs into language tokens while using auxiliary detection heads for music features. Outputs are projected into captions and composed with a large-language model for extended music descriptions.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that integrating music features into captioning improves the quality, richness, and detail of generated music descriptions.

Conclusion: Incorporating multi-task learning and feature integration significantly enhances music-captioning frameworks, contributing valuable data for music AI research and applications.

Abstract: Detailed captions that accurately reflect the characteristics of a music
piece can enrich music databases and drive forward research in music AI. This
paper introduces a multi-task music captioning model, SonicVerse, that
integrates caption generation with auxiliary music feature detection tasks such
as key detection, vocals detection, and more, so as to directly capture both
low-level acoustic details as well as high-level musical attributes. The key
contribution is a projection-based architecture that transforms audio input
into language tokens, while simultaneously detecting music features through
dedicated auxiliary heads. The outputs of these heads are also projected into
language tokens, to enhance the captioning input. This framework not only
produces rich, descriptive captions for short music fragments but also directly
enables the generation of detailed time-informed descriptions for longer music
pieces, by chaining the outputs using a large-language model. To train the
model, we extended the MusicBench dataset by annotating it with music features
using MIRFLEX, a modular music feature extractor, resulting in paired audio,
captions and music feature data. Experimental results show that incorporating
features in this way improves the quality and detail of the generated captions.

TL;DR: Passive acoustic monitoring employs automated recording units (ARUs) for wildlife research, addressing challenges in processing large audio datasets and enabling efficient signal detection, with the pycnet-audio tool building on PNW-Cnet model advancements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need for efficient methods in processing massive audio datasets from wildlife monitoring using ARUs, aiming to automate signal detection and overcome limitations of manual analysis.

Method: The authors developed pycnet-audio software leveraging the PNW-Cnet model, which is trained to detect vocalizations from around 80 wildlife species alongside environmental and anthropogenic noise.

Result: The PNW-Cnet model has demonstrated its capability to support population monitoring of forest owls and identify numerous species and noise forms.

Conclusion: The study presents pycnet-audio as a practical workflow solution, extending the scope of PNW-Cnet to enhance acoustic monitoring for diverse wildlife and noise detection campaigns.

Abstract: Passive acoustic monitoring is an emerging approach in wildlife research that
leverages recent improvements in purpose-made automated recording units (ARUs).
The general approach is to deploy ARUs in the field to record on a programmed
schedule for extended periods (weeks or months), after which the audio data are
retrieved. These data must then be processed, typically either by measuring or
analyzing characteristics of the audio itself (e.g. calculating acoustic
indices), or by searching for some signal of interest within the recordings,
e.g. vocalizations or other sounds produced by some target species,
anthropogenic or environmental noise, etc. In the latter case, some method is
required to locate the signal(s) of interest within the audio. While very small
datasets can simply be searched manually, even modest projects can produce
audio datasets on the order of 105 hours of recordings, making manual review
impractical and necessitating some form of automated detection. pycnet-audio
(Ruff 2024) is intended to provide a practical processing workflow for acoustic
data, built around the PNW-Cnet model, which was initially developed by the
U.S. Forest Service to support population monitoring of northern spotted owls
(Strix occidentalis caurina) and other forest owls (Lesmeister and Jenkins
2022; Ruff et al. 2020). PNW-Cnet has been expanded to detect vocalizations of
ca. 80 forest wildlife species and numerous forms of anthropogenic and
environmental noise (Ruff et al. 2021, 2023).

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks three state-of-the-art speech enhancement models (Wave-U-Net, CMGAN, U-Net) on their ability to suppress noise, maintain perceptual quality, and preserve speaker-specific features on diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the gap in evaluating the trade-offs between noise suppression, perceptual quality, and speaker-specific feature retention in existing speech enhancement models.

Method: The paper evaluates Wave-U-Net, CMGAN, and U-Net using multiple datasets (SpEAR, VPQAD, Clarkson), analyzing their performance across various metrics such as SNR, PESQ, and VeriSpeak to compare noise suppression, perceptual quality, and speaker recognition.

Result: U-Net demonstrated superior noise suppression with significant SNR improvements; CMGAN excelled in perceptual quality with the highest PESQ scores; Wave-U-Net showed strength in speaker-specific feature retention with notable VeriSpeak score gains.

Conclusion: The research highlights how distinct models optimize different trade-offs in speech enhancement, offering valuable insights into applications like voice biometrics, telecommunication, and forensic audio in noisy environments.

Abstract: Speech enhancement, particularly denoising, is vital in improving the
intelligibility and quality of speech signals for real-world applications,
especially in noisy environments. While prior research has introduced various
deep learning models for this purpose, many struggle to balance noise
suppression, perceptual quality, and speaker-specific feature preservation,
leaving a critical research gap in their comparative performance evaluation.
This study benchmarks three state-of-the-art models Wave-U-Net, CMGAN, and
U-Net, on diverse datasets such as SpEAR, VPQAD, and Clarkson datasets. These
models were chosen due to their relevance in the literature and code
accessibility. The evaluation reveals that U-Net achieves high noise
suppression with SNR improvements of +71.96% on SpEAR, +64.83% on VPQAD, and
+364.2% on the Clarkson dataset. CMGAN outperforms in perceptual quality,
attaining the highest PESQ scores of 4.04 on SpEAR and 1.46 on VPQAD, making it
well-suited for applications prioritizing natural and intelligible speech.
Wave-U-Net balances these attributes with improvements in speaker-specific
feature retention, evidenced by VeriSpeak score gains of +10.84% on SpEAR and
+27.38% on VPQAD. This research indicates how advanced methods can optimize
trade-offs between noise suppression, perceptual quality, and speaker
recognition. The findings may contribute to advancing voice biometrics,
forensic audio analysis, telecommunication, and speaker verification in
challenging acoustic conditions.

*Teysir Baoueb,Xiaoyu Bie,Xi Wang,Gaël Richard*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method for editing instruments in text-to-music diffusion models while preserving audio content without retraining the model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Musicians need precise control in text-to-music generation for specific creative outcomes, but current models lack reliable mechanisms for such control.

Method: The proposed approach identifies an optimal intermediate diffusion timestep using an instrument classifier, enabling precise instrument editing while maintaining the original audio structure.

Result: The method successfully balances preserving content and achieving desired timbre without requiring additional training or slowing down the generation process.

Conclusion: This approach demonstrates effective instrument editing in text-to-music models, addressing a key limitation in creative control with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Breakthroughs in text-to-music generation models are transforming the
creative landscape, equipping musicians with innovative tools for composition
and experimentation like never before. However, controlling the generation
process to achieve a specific desired outcome remains a significant challenge.
Even a minor change in the text prompt, combined with the same random seed, can
drastically alter the generated piece. In this paper, we explore the
application of existing text-to-music diffusion models for instrument editing.
Specifically, for an existing audio track, we aim to leverage a pretrained
text-to-music diffusion model to edit the instrument while preserving the
underlying content. Based on the insight that the model first focuses on the
overall structure or content of the audio, then adds instrument information,
and finally refines the quality, we show that selecting a well-chosen
intermediate timestep, identified through an instrument classifier, yields a
balance between preserving the original piece's content and achieving the
desired timbre. Our method does not require additional training of the
text-to-music diffusion model, nor does it compromise the generation process's
speed.

*Tobias Labarta,Nhi Hoang,Katharina Weitz,Wojciech Samek,Sebastian Lapuschkin,Leander Weber*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces the CUE model for understanding explainability in AI, focusing on how it meets cognitive needs (legibility, readability, interpretability), and shows that accessibility-optimized designs may not always benefit visually impaired users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI increasingly impacts critical decision-making, there is a need for explanations that are understandable to users, especially those with visual impairments.

Method: The study introduces the CUE model for explanation understanding and conducts an experiment with 455 users, testing heatmaps with different color maps (BWR, Cividis, Coolwarm) to observe their cognitive effects on users.

Result: The experiment revealed that while task performance was comparable across user groups, visually impaired users reported lower confidence and greater effort. Surprisingly, accessibility-focused designs like Cividis sometimes worsened these outcomes.

Conclusion: The findings validate the CUE model by linking explanation legibility to cognitive understandability. Furthermore, they challenge the assumption that accessibility-focused designs suffice, advocating for adaptive, user-centered XAI interfaces.

Abstract: As machine learning systems increasingly inform critical decisions, the need
for human-understandable explanations grows. Current evaluations of Explainable
AI (XAI) often prioritize technical fidelity over cognitive accessibility which
critically affects users, in particular those with visual impairments. We
propose CUE, a model for Cognitive Understanding of Explanations, linking
explanation properties to cognitive sub-processes: legibility (perception),
readability (comprehension), and interpretability (interpretation). In a study
(N=455) testing heatmaps with varying colormaps (BWR, Cividis, Coolwarm), we
found comparable task performance but lower confidence/effort for visually
impaired users. Unlike expected, these gaps were not mitigated and sometimes
worsened by accessibility-focused color maps like Cividis. These results
challenge assumptions about perceptual optimization and support the need for
adaptive XAI interfaces. They also validate CUE by demonstrating that altering
explanation legibility affects understandability. We contribute: (1) a
formalized cognitive model for explanation understanding, (2) an integrated
definition of human-centered explanation properties, and (3) empirical evidence
motivating accessible, user-tailored XAI.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: WebXAII is an open-source web framework designed to support research on human interaction with Explainable AI (XAI) by allowing researchers to create reusable and reproducible experimental protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of shared interfaces in XAI research, which hampers reusability and reproducibility in studies investigating human-AI interactions.

Method: WebXAII is implemented as a web-based platform that translates experimental protocols into a flexible composite architecture of views and modules, defined via a configuration file requiring minimal programming skills.

Result: WebXAII successfully reproduces the experimental protocol of a prominent study, demonstrating its capability to embody relevant research setups.

Conclusion: WebXAII streamlines and enhances XAI research by providing a reusable, easy-to-configure framework for conducting human interaction experiments with explainable AI systems.

Abstract: This article introduces WebXAII, an open-source web framework designed to
facilitate research on human interaction with eXplainable Artificial
Intelligence (XAI) systems. The field of XAI is rapidly expanding, driven by
the growing societal implications of the widespread adoption of AI (and in
particular machine learning) across diverse applications. Researchers who study
the interaction between humans and XAI techniques typically develop ad hoc
interfaces in order to conduct their studies. These interfaces are usually not
shared alongside the results of the studies, which limits their reusability and
the reproducibility of experiments. In response, we design and implement
WebXAII, a web-based platform that can embody full experimental protocols,
meaning that it can present all aspects of the experiment to human participants
and record their responses. The experimental protocols are translated into a
composite architecture of generic views and modules, which offers a lot of
flexibility. The architecture is defined in a structured configuration file, so
that protocols can be implemented with minimal programming skills. We
demonstrate that WebXAII can effectively embody relevant protocols, by
reproducing the protocol of a state-of-the-art study of the literature. The
framework is available at https://github.com/PAJEAN/WebXAII.

*Evdoxia Taka,Debadyuti Bhattacharya,Joanne Garde-Hansen,Sanjay Sharma,Tanaya Guha*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper presents a study on the usefulness and trustworthiness of AI-generated analytics for demographic representation in media using visualizations based on the CLIP model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional demographic analysis of media via AI lacks audience involvement; the research aims to investigate how useful and trustworthy AI analytics are to the general public.

Method: Developed an AI-based tool using the CLIP model for analyzing character demographics in visual media and conducted a user study to evaluate its effectiveness through targeted visualizations and user feedback.

Result: Participants acknowledged the tool's usefulness and understood its analytics but desired more detailed visualizations with additional demographic information. Trust in AI models was moderate to low.

Conclusion: AI has the potential for demographic analysis in media, but trust and usability concerns need improvement, emphasizing more comprehensive visualizations and context for better public acceptance.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI has enabled automated analysis of complex media content
at scale and generate actionable insights regarding character representation
along such dimensions as gender and age. Past work focused on quantifying
representation from audio/video/text using various ML models, but without
having the audience in the loop. We ask, even if character distribution along
demographic dimensions are available, how useful are they to the general
public? Do they actually trust the numbers generated by AI models? Our work
addresses these questions through a user study, while proposing a new AI-based
character representation and visualization tool. Our tool based on the
Contrastive Language Image Pretraining (CLIP) foundation model to analyze
visual screen data to quantify character representation across dimensions of
age and gender. We also designed effective visualizations suitable for
presenting such analytics to lay audience. Next, we conducted a user study to
seek empirical evidence on the usefulness and trustworthiness of the
AI-generated results for carefully chosen movies presented in the form of our
visualizations. We note that participants were able to understand the analytics
from our visualization, and deemed the tool `overall useful'. Participants also
indicated a need for more detailed visualizations to include more demographic
categories and contextual information of the characters. Participants' trust in
AI-based gender and age models is seen to be moderate to low, although they
were not against the use of AI in this context. Our tool including code,
benchmarking, and data from the user study can be found here:

*Francesco Chiossi,Julian Rasch,Robin Welsch,Albrecht Schmidt,Florian Michahelles*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper proposes a structured approach to intent communication in human-robot collaboration, focusing on multimodal strategies that enhance transparency and trust.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots are increasingly being integrated into collaborative workspaces, necessitating effective intent communication to ensure mutual understanding, trust, safety, and efficiency.

Method: The authors build on the SAT framework and task abstraction levels to propose a multidimensional design space that categorizes communication strategies by content, planning horizon, and modality.

Result: They conceptualize a design space that guides multimodal communication strategies for dynamic collaborative contexts, while identifying design challenges and raising key research questions.

Conclusion: The paper lays the groundwork for a future toolkit to support transparent, adaptive, and trustworthy human-robot interaction, advocating for multimodal approaches in hybrid work environments.

Abstract: As robots enter collaborative workspaces, ensuring mutual understanding
between human workers and robotic systems becomes a prerequisite for trust,
safety, and efficiency. In this position paper, we draw on the cooperation
scenario of the AIMotive project in which a human and a cobot jointly perform
assembly tasks to argue for a structured approach to intent communication.
Building on the Situation Awareness-based Agent Transparency (SAT) framework
and the notion of task abstraction levels, we propose a multidimensional design
space that maps intent content (SAT1, SAT3), planning horizon (operational to
strategic), and modality (visual, auditory, haptic). We illustrate how this
space can guide the design of multimodal communication strategies tailored to
dynamic collaborative work contexts. With this paper, we lay the conceptual
foundation for a future design toolkit aimed at supporting transparent
human-robot interaction in the workplace. We highlight key open questions and
design challenges, and propose a shared agenda for multimodal, adaptive, and
trustworthy robotic collaboration in hybrid work environments.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper examines the challenges faced by AI for Social Impact (AI4SI) projects in achieving real-world impact, identifying major barriers and proposing actionable strategies to overcome them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between AI4SI projects' ambitious goals and their limited real-world impact by diagnosing challenges and offering actionable strategies.

Method: The authors conducted semi-structured interviews with six leading AI4SI researchers and included their own experiences to perform a thematic analysis of the challenges hindering AI4SI deployments.

Result: The study identified structural and organizational, communication, collaboration, and operational challenges as the primary barriers to successful deployment of AI4SI projects.

Conclusion: The paper provides a set of best practices and actionable strategies aimed at helping AI4SI researchers and partner organizations overcome identified challenges and enhance their ability to deliver real-world social impact.

Abstract: In an attempt to tackle the UN SDGs, AI for Social Impact (AI4SI) projects
focus on harnessing AI to address societal issues in areas such as healthcare,
social justice, etc. Unfortunately, despite growing interest in AI4SI,
achieving tangible, on-the-ground impact remains a significant challenge. For
example, identifying and engaging motivated collaborators who are willing to
co-design and deploy AI based solutions in real-world settings is often
difficult. Even when such partnerships are established, many AI4SI projects
"fail" to progress beyond the proof-of-concept stage, and hence, are unable to
transition to at-scale production-level solutions. Furthermore, the unique
challenges faced by AI4SI researchers are not always fully recognized within
the broader AI community, where such work is sometimes viewed as primarily
applied and not aligning with the traditional criteria for novelty emphasized
in core AI venues. This paper attempts to shine a light on the diverse
challenges faced in AI4SI research by diagnosing a multitude of factors that
prevent AI4SI partnerships from achieving real-world impact on the ground.
Drawing on semi-structured interviews with six leading AI4SI researchers -
complemented by the authors' own lived experiences in conducting AI4SI research
- this paper attempts to understand the day-to-day difficulties faced in
developing and deploying socially impactful AI solutions. Through thematic
analysis, we identify structural and organizational, communication,
collaboration, and operational challenges as key barriers to deployment. While
there are no easy fixes, we synthesize best practices and actionable strategies
drawn from these interviews and our own work in this space. In doing so, we
hope this paper serves as a practical reference guide for AI4SI researchers and
partner organizations seeking to engage more effectively in socially impactful
AI collaborations.

*Richa Gupta,Alexander Htet Kyaw*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper introduces a pipeline that combines DALL-E 3-generated interior designs with sustainability metrics, helping designers evaluate environmental impacts through CO2e data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative AI has transformed architectural design with visuals from text prompts but lacks actionable environmental data for sustainable design.

Method: The pipeline integrates DALL-E 3 with a materials dataset. After image generation, a module identifies common materials and enriches them with CO2e values. Three user tests examined the effect of sustainability data inclusion.

Result: The third test, including CO2e data, led to better-informed design decisions but caused decision fatigue and lower user satisfaction. Most participants integrated sustainability principles.

Conclusion: Integrating sustainability metrics aids ecologically conscious design but must balance data provision with user satisfaction and decision-making freedom.

Abstract: Generative AI, specifically text-to-image models, have revolutionized
interior architectural design by enabling the rapid translation of conceptual
ideas into visual representations from simple text prompts. While generative AI
can produce visually appealing images they often lack actionable data for
designers In this work, we propose a novel pipeline that integrates DALL-E 3
with a materials dataset to enrich AI-generated designs with sustainability
metrics and material usage insights. After the model generates an interior
design image, a post-processing module identifies the top ten materials present
and pairs them with carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) values from a general
materials dictionary. This approach allows designers to immediately evaluate
environmental impacts and refine prompts accordingly. We evaluate the system
through three user tests: (1) no mention of sustainability to the user prior to
the prompting process with generative AI, (2) sustainability goals communicated
to the user before prompting, and (3) sustainability goals communicated along
with quantitative CO2e data included in the generative AI outputs. Our
qualitative and quantitative analyses reveal that the introduction of
sustainability metrics in the third test leads to more informed design
decisions, however, it can also trigger decision fatigue and lower overall
satisfaction. Nevertheless, the majority of participants reported incorporating
sustainability principles into their workflows in the third test, underscoring
the potential of integrated metrics to guide more ecologically responsible
practices. Our findings showcase the importance of balancing design freedom
with practical constraints, offering a clear path toward holistic, data-driven
solutions in AI-assisted architectural design.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper develops Carey, a GPT-4-based chatbot, to examine and address the informational and emotional support needs of family caregivers of Alzheimer's and dementia patients through interviews and analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Family caregivers of Alzheimer's patients face high emotional and logistical burdens, making them vulnerable to stress and mental health challenges. Generative AI, such as large language models, offers opportunities to alleviate these burdens, but how caregivers perceive and interact with such technologies remains underexplored.

Method: The authors developed 'Carey,' a GPT-4-based chatbot, and conducted semi-structured interviews with 16 caregivers after scenario-driven interactions with the chatbot. They used inductive coding and reflexive thematic analysis to understand caregivers' needs and expectations under six key themes.

Result: The study identified six themes critical to caregivers: on-demand information access, emotional support, safe disclosure, crisis management, personalization, and data privacy. It also uncovered tensions between caregivers' desires and concerns, leading to a nuanced mapping of needs, strengths, gaps, and design recommendations for AI chatbots.

Conclusion: This research provides theoretical and practical insights for designing AI systems that are proactive, trustworthy, and centered on the needs of caregivers, ultimately aiming to better support the mental health challenges of those caring for Alzheimer's and dementia patients.

Abstract: Family caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and Related
Dementia (AD/ADRD) face significant emotional and logistical challenges that
place them at heightened risk for stress, anxiety, and depression. Although
recent advances in generative AI -- particularly large language models (LLMs)
-- offer new opportunities to support mental health, little is known about how
caregivers perceive and engage with such technologies. To address this gap, we
developed Carey, a GPT-4o-based chatbot designed to provide informational and
emotional support to AD/ADRD caregivers. Using Carey as a technology probe, we
conducted semi-structured interviews with 16 family caregivers following
scenario-driven interactions grounded in common caregiving stressors. Through
inductive coding and reflexive thematic analysis, we surface a systemic
understanding of caregiver needs and expectations across six themes --
on-demand information access, emotional support, safe space for disclosure,
crisis management, personalization, and data privacy. For each of these themes,
we also identified the nuanced tensions in the caregivers' desires and
concerns. We present a mapping of caregiver needs, AI chatbot's strengths,
gaps, and design recommendations. Our findings offer theoretical and practical
insights to inform the design of proactive, trustworthy, and caregiver-centered
AI systems that better support the evolving mental health needs of AD/ADRD
caregivers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Survey creation is a labor-intensive process requiring domain expertise and methodological rigor; the paper aims to leverage LLMs to automate and enhance this process.

Method: The study deployed an LLM-powered survey creation system, evaluated its impact using the IS Success Model, proposed a hybrid evaluation framework, and implemented safeguards to address production risks.

Result: This paper identifies how generative AI can reshape survey creation in Information Systems, presents a hybrid evaluation framework, and introduces safeguards to ensure quality and responsible deployment.

Conclusion: Generative AI like LLMs can revolutionize survey creation processes in IS research by automating tasks while maintaining quality, supported by a unified evaluation framework and risk mitigation measures.

Abstract: Surveys are a cornerstone of Information Systems (IS) research, yet creating
high-quality surveys remains labor-intensive, requiring both domain expertise
and methodological rigor. With the evolution of large language models (LLMs),
new opportunities emerge to automate survey generation. This paper presents the
real-world deployment of an LLM-powered system designed to accelerate data
collection while maintaining survey quality. Deploying such systems in
production introduces real-world complexity, including diverse user needs and
quality control. We evaluate the system using the DeLone and McLean IS Success
Model to understand how generative AI can reshape a core IS method. This study
makes three key contributions. To our knowledge, this is the first application
of the IS Success Model to a generative AI system for survey creation. In
addition, we propose a hybrid evaluation framework combining automated and
human assessments. Finally, we implement safeguards that mitigate
post-deployment risks and support responsible integration into IS workflows.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a guide for understanding reliable visual analytics methods using dimensionality reduction, making the vast literature accessible for novices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The diversity and vastness of methodologies in literature on reliable DR-based visual analytics can overwhelm novice researchers and practitioners.

Method: The authors propose a guide based on prior classification in the literature, aiming to assess expertise and recommend relevant readings.

Result: Interviews with three experts affirmed the guide's significance, comprehensiveness, and usability.

Conclusion: The guide provides meaningful support for practitioners and researchers to navigate literature on dimensionality reduction for reliable visual analytics.

Abstract: Visual analytics using dimensionality reduction (DR) can easily be unreliable
for various reasons, e.g., inherent distortions in representing the original
data. The literature has thus proposed a wide range of methodologies to make
DR-based visual analytics reliable. However, the diversity and extensiveness of
the literature can leave novice analysts and researchers uncertain about where
to begin and proceed. To address this problem, we propose a guide for reading
papers for reliable visual analytics with DR. Relying on the previous
classification of the relevant literature, our guide helps both practitioners
to (1) assess their current DR expertise and (2) identify papers that will
further enhance their understanding. Interview studies with three experts in DR
and data visualizations validate the significance, comprehensiveness, and
usefulness of our guide.

*Ryota Okumura,Tadahiro Taniguchi,Akira Taniguchi,Yoshinobu Hagiwara*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a co-creative learning framework, enabling humans and AI to collaboratively create shared representations, and provides empirical evidence using a Bayesian inference-based human-AI interaction model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI systems often rely on unilateral knowledge transfer, which struggles to integrate the inherently different modalities of human and AI understanding. This paper aims to develop a collaborative paradigm in which both humans and AI align their perceptual experiences dynamically.

Method: The paper employs the Metropolis-Hastings naming game (MHNG) as the basis for modeling human-AI interactions. An online experiment was conducted with 69 participants who played a naming game with one of three computer-agent types (MH-based, always-accept, always-reject) under partial observability.

Result: Human-AI pairs using the MH-based agent significantly improved in categorization accuracy and demonstrated stronger convergence toward a shared sign system. Human behaviors were well-aligned with MH-derived probabilities, validating the framework's premise.

Conclusion: Co-creative learning, facilitated via MHNG-based interaction, shows significant promise in fostering symbiotic AI systems that learn alongside humans through dynamic perceptual alignment, rather than unilaterally.

Abstract: We propose co-creative learning as a novel paradigm where humans and AI,
i.e., biological and artificial agents, mutually integrate their partial
perceptual information and knowledge to construct shared external
representations, a process we interpret as symbol emergence. Unlike traditional
AI teaching based on unilateral knowledge transfer, this addresses the
challenge of integrating information from inherently different modalities. We
empirically test this framework using a human-AI interaction model based on the
Metropolis-Hastings naming game (MHNG), a decentralized Bayesian inference
mechanism. In an online experiment, 69 participants played a joint attention
naming game (JA-NG) with one of three computer agent types (MH-based,
always-accept, or always-reject) under partial observability. Results show that
human-AI pairs with an MH-based agent significantly improved categorization
accuracy through interaction and achieved stronger convergence toward a shared
sign system. Furthermore, human acceptance behavior aligned closely with the
MH-derived acceptance probability. These findings provide the first empirical
evidence for co-creative learning emerging in human-AI dyads via MHNG-based
interaction. This suggests a promising path toward symbiotic AI systems that
learn with humans, rather than from them, by dynamically aligning perceptual
experiences, opening a new venue for symbiotic AI alignment.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using GPT-based models within the LangChain framework to enhance remote learning resource retrieval, focusing on improving precision and contextual depth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of depth and contextual meaning in current remote learning resource retrieval systems, especially for complex student queries.

Method: Integrates GPT-based models within the LangChain framework using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and prompt engineering to enhance precision and contextual relevance.

Result: Demonstrates improved retrieval results in terms of user satisfaction and learning outcomes when compared to traditional Large Language Models (LLMs).

Conclusion: The proposed framework is effective in providing more precise, contextually rich, and student-centered retrieval results, showcasing potential for enhancing remote learning experiences.

Abstract: Large Language Models have brought a radical change in the process of remote
learning students, among other aspects of educative activities. Current
retrieval of remote learning resources lacks depth in contextual meaning that
provides comprehensive information on complex student queries. This work
proposes a novel approach to enhancing remote learning retrieval by integrating
GPT-based models within the LangChain framework. We achieve this system in a
more intuitive and productive manner using CoT reasoning and prompt
engineering. The framework we propose puts much emphasis on increasing the
precision and relevance of the retrieval results to return comprehensive and
contextually enriched explanations and resources that best suit each student's
needs. We also assess the effectiveness of our approach against paradigmatic
LLMs and report improvements in user satisfaction and learning outcomes.

*Rui Zhao,Beihong Jin,Beibei Li,Yiyuan Zheng*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: This paper proposes CI4GI, a model to recommend groups to users on social media by leveraging the collaborative relationship between group-level and item-level interests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the increasing demand for recommending groups to users on social media while acknowledging the dynamic interplay between users' group-level and item-level interests.

Method: The authors introduced an interest-enhancement strategy and optimized the identification of negative samples by measuring the distance between interest distributions, addressing the issue of false-negative samples.

Result: CI4GI outperformed state-of-the-art models on three real-world datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: CI4GI successfully captures the collaborative evolution relationship of user interests for improved group recommendation, addressing deficiencies in existing methods.

Abstract: With the popularity of social media, an increasing number of users are
joining group activities on online social platforms. This elicits the
requirement of group identification (GI), which is to recommend groups to
users. We reveal that users are influenced by both group-level and item-level
interests, and these dual-level interests have a collaborative evolution
relationship: joining a group expands the user's item interests, further
prompting the user to join new groups. Ultimately, the two interests tend to
align dynamically. However, existing GI methods fail to fully model this
collaborative evolution relationship, ignoring the enhancement of group-level
interests on item-level interests, and suffering from false-negative samples
when aligning cross-level interests. In order to fully model the collaborative
evolution relationship between dual-level user interests, we propose CI4GI, a
Collaborative Interest-aware model for Group Identification. Specifically, we
design an interest enhancement strategy that identifies additional interests of
users from the items interacted with by the groups they have joined as a
supplement to item-level interests. In addition, we adopt the distance between
interest distributions of two users to optimize the identification of negative
samples for a user, mitigating the interference of false-negative samples
during cross-level interests alignment. The results of experiments on three
real-world datasets demonstrate that CI4GI significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art models.

### [350] [Detecting Narrative Shifts through Persistent Structures: A Topological Analysis of Media Discourse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14836)
*Mark M. Bailey,Mark I. Heiligman*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: The study uses persistent homology to analyze structural changes in media narratives triggered by global events, identifying shifts using topological metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to develop a systematic method to detect how global events reconfigure public discourse without relying on prior knowledge of specific occurrences.

Method: Persistent homology is utilized to quantify narrative changes in news articles through co-occurrence graphs, persistence diagrams, Wasserstein distances, and entropy calculations.

Result: Significant geopolitical and social events correlate with detectable shifts in key metrics (H0 and H1), indicating major narrative reorganizations. Evidence suggests cascade effects or top-down narrative framing of discourse.

Conclusion: Persistent homology enables real-time detection of semantic shifts during global events, contributing a novel approach to computational social science for analyzing public discourse dynamics.

Abstract: How can we detect when global events fundamentally reshape public discourse?
This study introduces a topological framework for identifying structural change
in media narratives using persistent homology. Drawing on international news
articles surrounding major events - including the Russian invasion of Ukraine
(Feb 2022), the murder of George Floyd (May 2020), the U.S. Capitol
insurrection (Jan 2021), and the Hamas-led invasion of Israel (Oct 2023) - we
construct daily co-occurrence graphs of noun phrases to trace evolving
discourse. Each graph is embedded and transformed into a persistence diagram
via a Vietoris-Rips filtration. We then compute Wasserstein distances and
persistence entropies across homological dimensions to capture semantic
disruption and narrative volatility over time. Our results show that major
geopolitical and social events align with sharp spikes in both H0 (connected
components) and H1 (loops), indicating sudden reorganization in narrative
structure and coherence. Cross-correlation analyses reveal a typical lag
pattern in which changes to component-level structure (H0) precede higher-order
motif shifts (H1), suggesting a bottom-up cascade of semantic change. An
exception occurs during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, where H1 entropy leads
H0, possibly reflecting top-down narrative framing before local discourse
adjusts. Persistence entropy further distinguishes tightly focused from diffuse
narrative regimes. These findings demonstrate that persistent homology offers a
mathematically principled, unsupervised method for detecting inflection points
and directional shifts in public attention - without requiring prior knowledge
of specific events. This topological approach advances computational social
science by enabling real-time detection of semantic restructuring during
crises, protests, and information shocks.

### [351] [Preparing for the Intelligence Explosion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14863)
*William MacAskill,Fin Moorhouse*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper discusses challenges posed by rapid technological advancements enabled by AI and emphasizes proactive preparation for an intelligence explosion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rapid AI-driven research could accelerate technological advancements, raising urgent and consequential global challenges.

Method: Proposes proactive measures to address impending challenges rather than relying entirely on future AI systems.

Result: Identifies specific grand challenges, such as AI-enabled autocracies and moral considerations for digital beings, that require immediate attention.

Conclusion: AGI preparedness should encompass alignment efforts and immediate strategies to mitigate risks and capitalize on opportunities brought by intelligence explosions.

Abstract: AI that can accelerate research could drive a century of technological
progress over just a few years. During such a period, new technological or
political developments will raise consequential and hard-to-reverse decisions,
in rapid succession. We call these developments grand challenges. These
challenges include new weapons of mass destruction, AI-enabled autocracies,
races to grab offworld resources, and digital beings worthy of moral
consideration, as well as opportunities to dramatically improve quality of life
and collective decision-making. We argue that these challenges cannot always be
delegated to future AI systems, and suggest things we can do today to
meaningfully improve our prospects. AGI preparedness is therefore not just
about ensuring that advanced AI systems are aligned: we should be preparing,
now, for the disorienting range of developments an intelligence explosion would
bring.

### [352] [Hypothesis Testing for Quantifying LLM-Human Misalignment in Multiple Choice Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14997)
*Harbin Hong,Sebastian Caldas,Liu Leqi*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The abstract analyzes how well Large Language Models (LLMs) replicate human behavior in surveys and concludes that they often misalign with real human populations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs are increasingly used in social science research, it is critical to evaluate their ability to simulate human behavior accurately.

Method: The authors propose a hypothesis-testing framework to quantitatively measure LLM-human behavior alignment in multiple-choice survey settings.

Result: The study found that a popular language model failed to simulate opinions across various sub-populations (e.g., races, ages, incomes) on contentious survey questions.

Conclusion: Current LLMs may not be suitable for social science research without better alignment practices, especially in diverse or controversial contexts.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly appear in social science
research (e.g., economics and marketing), it becomes crucial to assess how well
these models replicate human behavior. In this work, using hypothesis testing,
we present a quantitative framework to assess the misalignment between
LLM-simulated and actual human behaviors in multiple-choice survey settings.
This framework allows us to determine in a principled way whether a specific
language model can effectively simulate human opinions, decision-making, and
general behaviors represented through multiple-choice options. We applied this
framework to a popular language model for simulating people's opinions in
various public surveys and found that this model is ill-suited for simulating
the tested sub-populations (e.g., across different races, ages, and incomes)
for contentious questions. This raises questions about the alignment of this
language model with the tested populations, highlighting the need for new
practices in using LLMs for social science studies beyond naive simulations of
human subjects.

### [353] [Transit for All: Mapping Equitable Bike2Subway Connection using Region Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15113)
*Min Namgung,JangHyeon Lee,Fangyi Ding,Yao-Yi Chiang*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Transit for All (TFA) framework to strategically expand bike-sharing systems (BSS) into underserved areas by predicting demand, improving accessibility metrics, and providing station placement recommendations to address transit equity gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work addresses the problem of inequitable public transit access, particularly affecting low-income and minority communities in cities like NYC, by exploring the potential of bike-sharing systems to bridge these gaps.

Method: The proposed method, TFA, includes (1) spatial bike-sharing demand prediction using region representation learning with multimodal geospatial data, (2) development of a weighted Public Transport Accessibility Level (wPTAL) metric, and (3) recommendations for station placement based on ridership potential and equity impact.

Result: The study, using NYC as a case study, demonstrates that TFA-guided bike station placements reduce transit access disparities for low-income and minority groups, improving equitable access.

Conclusion: TFA offers a practical solution for urban planners to guide equitable transit expansion and improve the quality of life in underserved urban areas.

Abstract: Ensuring equitable public transit access remains challenging, particularly in
densely populated cities like New York City (NYC), where low-income and
minority communities often face limited transit accessibility. Bike-sharing
systems (BSS) can bridge these equity gaps by providing affordable first- and
last-mile connections. However, strategically expanding BSS into underserved
neighborhoods is difficult due to uncertain bike-sharing demand at newly
planned ("cold-start") station locations and limitations in traditional
accessibility metrics that may overlook realistic bike usage potential. We
introduce Transit for All (TFA), a spatial computing framework designed to
guide the equitable expansion of BSS through three components: (1)
spatially-informed bike-sharing demand prediction at cold-start stations using
region representation learning that integrates multimodal geospatial data, (2)
comprehensive transit accessibility assessment leveraging our novel weighted
Public Transport Accessibility Level (wPTAL) by combining predicted
bike-sharing demand with conventional transit accessibility metrics, and (3)
strategic recommendations for new bike station placements that consider
potential ridership and equity enhancement. Using NYC as a case study, we
identify transit accessibility gaps that disproportionately impact low-income
and minority communities in historically underserved neighborhoods. Our results
show that strategically placing new stations guided by wPTAL notably reduces
disparities in transit access related to economic and demographic factors. From
our study, we demonstrate that TFA provides practical guidance for urban
planners to promote equitable transit and enhance the quality of life in
underserved urban communities.

*Christina Q. Knight,Kaustubh Deshpande,Ved Sirdeshmukh,Meher Mankikar,Scale Red Team,SEAL Research Team,Julian Michael*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper introduces FORTRESS, a benchmark to objectively evaluate large language models' (LLMs) safeguards against misuse in national security and public safety domains, highlighting trade-offs between risk mitigation and model usefulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation was driven by the need to address dual-use capabilities of LLMs, specifically safeguarding against misuse relating to national security and public safety threats while ensuring models remain useful to benign users.

Method: FORTRESS involves creating 500 expert-crafted adversarial prompts with binary-question rubrics across three domains (CBRNE, Political Violence & Terrorism, and Criminal & Financial Illicit Activities). It includes both adversarial and benign prompt-pairs to evaluate models’ robustness and refusals.

Result: The authors assessed various frontier LLMs (like Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Deepseek-R1, and o1), revealing significant differences in risk scores (ARS) and over-refusal scores (ORS), showcasing trade-offs between security safeguards and helpfulness.

Conclusion: FORTRESS provides vital insights about LLMs’ balance in trade-offs, contributing to policymaking and research on safeguarding LLMs against NSPS risks. The dataset is made publicly available to facilitate further investigation.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) introduces dual-use
capabilities that could both threaten and bolster national security and public
safety (NSPS). Models implement safeguards to protect against potential misuse
relevant to NSPS and allow for benign users to receive helpful information.
However, current benchmarks often fail to test safeguard robustness to
potential NSPS risks in an objective, robust way. We introduce FORTRESS: 500
expert-crafted adversarial prompts with instance-based rubrics of 4-7 binary
questions for automated evaluation across 3 domains (unclassified information
only): Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and Explosive (CBRNE),
Political Violence & Terrorism, and Criminal & Financial Illicit Activities,
with 10 total subcategories across these domains. Each prompt-rubric pair has a
corresponding benign version to test for model over-refusals. This evaluation
of frontier LLMs' safeguard robustness reveals varying trade-offs between
potential risks and model usefulness: Claude-3.5-Sonnet demonstrates a low
average risk score (ARS) (14.09 out of 100) but the highest over-refusal score
(ORS) (21.8 out of 100), while Gemini 2.5 Pro shows low over-refusal (1.4) but
a high average potential risk (66.29). Deepseek-R1 has the highest ARS at
78.05, but the lowest ORS at only 0.06. Models such as o1 display a more even
trade-off between potential risks and over-refusals (with an ARS of 21.69 and
ORS of 5.2). To provide policymakers and researchers with a clear understanding
of models' potential risks, we publicly release FORTRESS at
https://huggingface.co/datasets/ScaleAI/fortress_public. We also maintain a
private set for evaluation.

*Siwei Tu,Jingyi Xu,Weidong Yang,Lei Bai,Ben Fei*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method called MODS to improve the downscaling of low-resolution meteorological data using multi-source satellite and topographic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for deriving high-resolution meteorological data suffer from inaccuracies due to reliance on limited satellite data and simpler interpolation techniques.

Method: The proposed MODS framework integrates multi-source satellite data with topographic inputs, using a conditional diffusion model and cross-attention module for pre-training on ERA5 reanalysis data.

Result: MODS successfully downscales ERA5 maps to a high resolution of 6.25 km while maintaining higher fidelity and alignment with real-world atmospheric conditions.

Conclusion: MODS demonstrates significant improvements in producing high-resolution meteorological data by leveraging diverse observational data sources and advanced modeling techniques.

Abstract: Accurate acquisition of high-resolution surface meteorological conditions is
critical for forecasting and simulating meteorological variables. Directly
applying spatial interpolation methods to derive meteorological values at
specific locations from low-resolution grid fields often yields results that
deviate significantly from the actual conditions. Existing downscaling methods
primarily rely on the coupling relationship between geostationary satellites
and ERA5 variables as a condition. However, using brightness temperature data
from geostationary satellites alone fails to comprehensively capture all the
changes in meteorological variables in ERA5 maps. To address this limitation,
we can use a wider range of satellite data to make more full use of its
inversion effects on various meteorological variables, thus producing more
realistic results across different meteorological variables. To further improve
the accuracy of downscaling meteorological variables at any location, we
propose the Multi-source Observation Down-Scaling Model (MODS). It is a
conditional diffusion model that fuses data from multiple geostationary
satellites GridSat, polar-orbiting satellites (AMSU-A, HIRS, and MHS), and
topographic data (GEBCO), as conditions, and is pre-trained on the ERA5
reanalysis dataset. During training, latent features from diverse conditional
inputs are extracted separately and fused into ERA5 maps via a multi-source
cross-attention module. By exploiting the inversion relationships between
reanalysis data and multi-source atmospheric variables, MODS generates
atmospheric states that align more closely with real-world conditions. During
sampling, MODS enhances downscaling consistency by incorporating low-resolution
ERA5 maps and station-level meteorological data as guidance. Experimental
results demonstrate that MODS achieves higher fidelity when downscaling ERA5
maps to a 6.25 km resolution.

*Andela Ilic,Jiaxi Jiang,Paul Streli,Xintong Liu,Christian Holz*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a technique for estimating full-body human poses using sparse, loosely attached IMUs, leveraging transformer-based diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion capture approaches rely on tightly attached IMUs, a condition often impractical in real-world use.

Method: The paper uses transformer-based diffusion models trained on simulated loose IMU recordings that incorporate garment-related parameters.

Result: The proposed methods surpass the current state-of-the-art in performance, confirmed by experimental results.

Conclusion: This work establishes a foundation for advancing human pose estimation using loosely attached sensors, expanding motion capture capabilities.

Abstract: Motion capture using sparse inertial sensors has shown great promise due to
its portability and lack of occlusion issues compared to camera-based tracking.
Existing approaches typically assume that IMU sensors are tightly attached to
the human body. However, this assumption often does not hold in real-world
scenarios. In this paper, we present a new task of full-body human pose
estimation using sparse, loosely attached IMU sensors. To solve this task, we
simulate IMU recordings from an existing garment-aware human motion dataset. We
developed transformer-based diffusion models to synthesize loose IMU data and
estimate human poses based on this challenging loose IMU data. In addition, we
show that incorporating garment-related parameters while training the model on
simulated loose data effectively maintains expressiveness and enhances the
ability to capture variations introduced by looser or tighter garments.
Experiments show that our proposed diffusion methods trained on simulated and
synthetic data outperformed the state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and
qualitatively, opening up a promising direction for future research.

*Han Wu,Junyao Li,Kangbo Zhao,Sen Zhang,Yukai Shi,Liang Lin*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a one-shot face sketch synthesis method using diffusion models and a new benchmark called OS-Sketch for more realistic evaluations, addressing issues in traditional data-intensive methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing face sketch synthesis methods rely heavily on large datasets of photo-sketch pairs, which are costly and face performance degradation when data is scarce.

Method: The proposed method uses a diffusion model optimized with text instructions based on gradient-based optimization for face photo-sketch synthesis. A new benchmark dataset, OS-Sketch, is introduced with diverse pairs of face photos and sketches for evaluation.

Result: Experiments show that the method generates realistic and consistent sketches from various photos in one-shot learning setups, outperforming existing approaches in convenience and applicability.

Conclusion: The one-shot synthesis approach significantly reduces dependency on large datasets, making the process more practical and versatile for different scenarios. The OS-Sketch dataset further enhances the evaluation process for real-world applications.

Abstract: Face sketch synthesis is a technique aimed at converting face photos into
sketches. Existing face sketch synthesis research mainly relies on training
with numerous photo-sketch sample pairs from existing datasets. However, these
large-scale discriminative learning methods will have to face problems such as
data scarcity and high human labor costs. Once the training data becomes
scarce, their generative performance significantly degrades. In this paper, we
propose a one-shot face sketch synthesis method based on diffusion models. We
optimize text instructions on a diffusion model using face photo-sketch image
pairs. Then, the instructions derived through gradient-based optimization are
used for inference. To simulate real-world scenarios more accurately and
evaluate method effectiveness more comprehensively, we introduce a new
benchmark named One-shot Face Sketch Dataset (OS-Sketch). The benchmark
consists of 400 pairs of face photo-sketch images, including sketches with
different styles and photos with different backgrounds, ages, sexes,
expressions, illumination, etc. For a solid out-of-distribution evaluation, we
select only one pair of images for training at each time, with the rest used
for inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can
convert various photos into realistic and highly consistent sketches in a
one-shot context. Compared to other methods, our approach offers greater
convenience and broader applicability. The dataset will be available at:

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Nabla-R2D3 introduces a reinforcement learning framework to improve 3D diffusion models using 2D reward signals, showing superior efficacy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing 3D generative models in following instructions, aligning with human preferences, and producing realistic textures, geometries, and physical attributes.

Method: Nabla-R2D3 leverages a reinforcement learning framework for 3D-native diffusion models, using 2D reward signals and based on the Nabla-GFlowNet approach for principled reward finetuning.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that Nabla-R2D3 achieves higher rewards and avoids prior forgetting compared to traditional finetuning methods.

Conclusion: Nabla-R2D3 is a highly effective and sample-efficient solution for adapting 3D generative models, addressing key challenges in 3D asset generation.

Abstract: Generating high-quality and photorealistic 3D assets remains a longstanding
challenge in 3D vision and computer graphics. Although state-of-the-art
generative models, such as diffusion models, have made significant progress in
3D generation, they often fall short of human-designed content due to limited
ability to follow instructions, align with human preferences, or produce
realistic textures, geometries, and physical attributes. In this paper, we
introduce Nabla-R2D3, a highly effective and sample-efficient reinforcement
learning alignment framework for 3D-native diffusion models using 2D rewards.
Built upon the recently proposed Nabla-GFlowNet method, which matches the score
function to reward gradients in a principled manner for reward finetuning, our
Nabla-R2D3 enables effective adaptation of 3D diffusion models using only 2D
reward signals. Extensive experiments show that, unlike vanilla finetuning
baselines which either struggle to converge or suffer from reward hacking,
Nabla-R2D3 consistently achieves higher rewards and reduced prior forgetting
within a few finetuning steps.

*Max Ku,Sun Sun,Hongyu Guo,Wenhu Chen*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: DisProtEdit is a new framework for editing proteins that separates their structural and functional properties for better control and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current protein editing methods rely on joint embeddings, which limit the ability to control and interpret edits. This paper aims to address this limitation by disentangling structural and functional properties.

Method: This paper introduces DisProtEdit, which uses dual-channel natural language supervision to disentangle protein properties. They also build SwissProtDis, a multimodal dataset with separate textual descriptions for structure and function, and employ objectives like alignment, uniformity, and disentanglement loss.

Result: Experiments show that DisProtEdit performs competitively with current methods in protein editing and representation tasks. On a multi-attribute editing benchmark, it achieves a success rate of up to 61.7%.

Conclusion: DisProtEdit improves the interpretability and controllability of protein editing through disentangled representations, demonstrating its potential to advance the field with modular editing capabilities.

Abstract: We introduce DisProtEdit, a controllable protein editing framework that
leverages dual-channel natural language supervision to learn disentangled
representations of structural and functional properties. Unlike prior
approaches that rely on joint holistic embeddings, DisProtEdit explicitly
separates semantic factors, enabling modular and interpretable control. To
support this, we construct SwissProtDis, a large-scale multimodal dataset where
each protein sequence is paired with two textual descriptions, one for
structure and one for function, automatically decomposed using a large language
model. DisProtEdit aligns protein and text embeddings using alignment and
uniformity objectives, while a disentanglement loss promotes independence
between structural and functional semantics. At inference time, protein editing
is performed by modifying one or both text inputs and decoding from the updated
latent representation. Experiments on protein editing and representation
learning benchmarks demonstrate that DisProtEdit performs competitively with
existing methods while providing improved interpretability and controllability.
On a newly constructed multi-attribute editing benchmark, the model achieves a
both-hit success rate of up to 61.7%, highlighting its effectiveness in
coordinating simultaneous structural and functional edits.

*Wanzhe Wang,Jianqiu Peng,Menghao Hu,Weihuang Zhong,Tong Zhang,Shuai Wang,Yixin Zhang,Mingjie Shao,Wanli Ni*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: This study introduces a large language model (LLM) agent for automatically tuning hyper-parameters in the WS-PSO-CM algorithm, enhancing UAV trajectory and communication performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for tuning hyper-parameters in WS-PSO-CM algorithms rely heavily on heuristics, which lack automation and yield suboptimal results.

Method: The paper designs an LLM agent that iteratively generates and optimizes hyper-parameters via a framework using a model context protocol (MCP) while invoking the WS-PSO-CM algorithm.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that hyper-parameters derived from the LLM agent lead to significantly higher minimal sum-rate performance compared to heuristic or random methods.

Conclusion: An LLM agent with expertise in PSO and WS-PSO-CM proves effective for generating highly efficient hyper-parameters, surpassing traditional tuning methods.

Abstract: Hyper-parameters are essential and critical for the performance of
communication algorithms. However, current hyper-parameters tuning methods for
warm-start particles swarm optimization with cross and mutation (WS-PSO-CM)
algortihm for radio map-enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) trajectory and
communication are primarily heuristic-based, exhibiting low levels of
automation and unsatisfactory performance. In this paper, we design an large
language model (LLM) agent for automatic hyper-parameters-tuning, where an
iterative framework and model context protocol (MCP) are applied. In
particular, the LLM agent is first setup via a profile, which specifies the
mission, background, and output format. Then, the LLM agent is driven by the
prompt requirement, and iteratively invokes WS-PSO-CM algorithm for
exploration. Finally, the LLM agent autonomously terminates the loop and
returns a set of hyper-parameters. Our experiment results show that the minimal
sum-rate achieved by hyper-parameters generated via our LLM agent is
significantly higher than those by both human heuristics and random generation
methods. This indicates that an LLM agent with PSO knowledge and WS-PSO-CM
algorithm background is useful in finding high-performance hyper-parameters.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a gradient-free adaptation technique using in-context learning (ICL) for wireless receivers, eliminating the need for online retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning-based wireless receiver adaptations either lack flexibility or require gradient-based optimization, prompting a need for efficient, dynamic techniques.

Method: The paper explores ICL architectures using Transformer models and structured state-space models (SSMs), supplemented with theoretical and empirical analyses, particularly focusing on cell-free massive MIMO networks.

Result: Empirical evidence and theoretical analyses demonstrate that ICL enables real-time adaptation of wireless receivers with pilot signals and contextual information, achieving efficient operation without online retraining.

Conclusion: ICL provides a robust, practical solution for real-time adaptation in challenging wireless communication environments, facilitating efficiency and eliminating the need for gradient-based optimization.

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has facilitated the creation of wireless
receivers capable of functioning effectively in conditions that challenge
traditional model-based designs. Leveraging programmable hardware
architectures, deep learning-based receivers offer the potential to dynamically
adapt to varying channel environments. However, current adaptation strategies,
including joint training, hypernetwork-based methods, and meta-learning, either
demonstrate limited flexibility or necessitate explicit optimization through
gradient descent. This paper presents gradient-free adaptation techniques
rooted in the emerging paradigm of in-context learning (ICL). We review
architectural frameworks for ICL based on Transformer models and structured
state-space models (SSMs), alongside theoretical insights into how sequence
models effectively learn adaptation from contextual information. Further, we
explore the application of ICL to cell-free massive MIMO networks, providing
both theoretical analyses and empirical evidence. Our findings indicate that
ICL represents a principled and efficient approach to real-time receiver
adaptation using pilot signals and auxiliary contextual information-without
requiring online retraining.
