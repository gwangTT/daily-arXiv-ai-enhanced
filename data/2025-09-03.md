### [1] [A Comparative Study of Controllability, Explainability, and Performance in Dysfluency Detection Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00058)
*Eric Zhang,Li Wei,Sarah Chen,Michael Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper compares four dysfluency detection models: YOLO-Stutter, FluentNet, UDM, and SSDM in terms of performance, controllability, and explainability, with UDM emerging as the most clinically interpretable and balanced.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for dysfluency detection models that are not only accurate but also controllable and explainable for real-world clinical use.

Method: Systematic comparative analysis of four models along performance, controllability, and explainability, tested on multiple datasets and assessed by clinicians.

Result: YOLO-Stutter and FluentNet offer efficiency but limited transparency; UDM balances accuracy and interpretability; SSDM's results were unreproducible in this study.

Conclusion: Trade-offs exist among current models; UDM shows potential for clinical adoption while other models need further refinement for practical deployment.

Abstract: Recent advances in dysfluency detection have introduced a variety of modeling
paradigms, ranging from lightweight object-detection inspired networks
(YOLOStutter) to modular interpretable frameworks (UDM). While performance on
benchmark datasets continues to improve, clinical adoption requires more than
accuracy: models must be controllable and explainable. In this paper, we
present a systematic comparative analysis of four representative
approaches--YOLO-Stutter, FluentNet, UDM, and SSDM--along three dimensions:
performance, controllability, and explainability. Through comprehensive
evaluation on multiple datasets and expert clinician assessment, we find that
YOLO-Stutter and FluentNet provide efficiency and simplicity, but with limited
transparency; UDM achieves the best balance of accuracy and clinical
interpretability; and SSDM, while promising, could not be fully reproduced in
our experiments. Our analysis highlights the trade-offs among competing
approaches and identifies future directions for clinically viable dysfluency
modeling. We also provide detailed implementation insights and practical
deployment considerations for each approach.

### [2] [Beyond Memorization: Reasoning-Driven Synthesis as a Mitigation Strategy Against Benchmark Contamination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00072)
*Terry Jingchen Zhang,Gopal Dev,Ning Wang,Nicole Ni,Wenyuan Jiang,Yinya Huang,Bernhard Schölkopf,Mrinmaya Sachan,Zhijing Jin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study evaluates the issue of data contamination in large language model (LLM) benchmarks by using a scalable framework to create research-level QA from arXiv papers, revealing no significant performance decay near knowledge cutoff dates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns about data contamination raise doubts about whether current benchmarks for LLMs test genuine reasoning capabilities or simply memorization of pre-exposed data.

Method: The study used an infinitely scalable framework to generate QA questions from arXiv papers while leveraging the temporal structure of research publications. It conducted evaluations on 4 LLMs with different knowledge cutoff dates, using 1,643 multi-step reasoning questions synthesized from 20,277 arXiv papers published across 26 months.

Result: The results showed no significant performance decay near knowledge cutoff dates across various LLM developers, sizes, and release dates, suggesting limited benchmark contamination.

Conclusion: The study proposes that incorporating multi-step reasoning tasks in benchmark synthesis adds complexity and mitigates shallow memorization issues. It advocates for prioritizing reasoning-driven synthesis of benchmarks rather than relying on periodic updates with new questions.

Abstract: Capability evaluation of large language models (LLMs) is increasingly
shadowed by rising concerns of data contamination that cast doubts on whether
static benchmarks measure genuine reasoning or mere memorization. We present an
empirical study using an infinitely scalable framework to synthesize
research-level QA directly from arXiv papers, harnessing the natural temporal
structure of research publications where performance decay after knowledge
cutoffs may indicate potential contamination. We evaluated 4 frontier model
represented by 2 models of different knowledge cutoff dates per family on 1,643
multi-step reasoning questions synthesized from 20,277 arXiv papers stratified
over 26 months, covering at least 6 months before and after all cutoff dates.
Our results consistently showed a lack of significant performance decay near
knowledge cutoff dates for models of various sizes, developers, and release
dates. We further performed a comparative analysis with previous longitudinal
studies that reported significant post-cutoff performance decay using directly
retrieved questions based on public data. we hypothesize that the multi-step
reasoning required by our synthesis pipeline offered additional complexity that
goes deeper than shallow memorization, which effectively serves a mitigation
strategy against benchmark contamination. We fully open source our code and
dataset to aid reproducibility and advocate for a paradigm shift that
prioritize reasoning-driven synthesis to construct benchmarks over simply
collecting newly released questions periodically.

### [3] [Language and Experience: A Computational Model of Social Learning in Complex Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00074)
*Cédric Colas,Tracey Mills,Ben Prystawski,Michael Henry Tessler,Noah Goodman,Jacob Andreas,Joshua Tenenbaum*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a computational framework integrating linguistic guidance with direct experience for social learning in humans and AI, using probabilistic models and experiments across video games.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and model the integration of linguistic guidance and experiential learning for faster, safer, and collaborative learning in both humans and AI.

Method: The authors turn a pretrained language model into a probabilistic framework for interpreting and generating advice, enabling Bayesian inference across sensorimotor and linguistic data. Experiments are conducted with video games and iterated learning setups.

Result: Linguistic guidance notably influences exploration and learning patterns, reducing risks and accelerating key discoveries for humans and AI. It demonstrates successful knowledge transfer across generations and between humans and models.

Conclusion: The framework allows for effective accumulation and transfer of knowledge, showcasing potential for human-machine collaborative learning with structured, language-compatible representations.

Abstract: The ability to combine linguistic guidance from others with direct experience
is central to human development, enabling safe and rapid learning in new
environments. How do people integrate these two sources of knowledge, and how
might AI systems? We present a computational framework that models social
learning as joint probabilistic inference over structured, executable world
models given sensorimotor and linguistic data. We make this possible by turning
a pretrained language model into a probabilistic model of how humans share
advice conditioned on their beliefs, allowing our agents both to generate
advice for others and to interpret linguistic input as evidence during Bayesian
inference. Using behavioral experiments and simulations across 10 video games,
we show how linguistic guidance can shape exploration and accelerate learning
by reducing risky interactions and speeding up key discoveries in both humans
and models. We further explore how knowledge can accumulate across generations
through iterated learning experiments and demonstrate successful knowledge
transfer between humans and models -- revealing how structured,
language-compatible representations might enable human-machine collaborative
learning.

### [4] [Analysis of Error Sources in LLM-based Hypothesis Search for Few-Shot Rule Induction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01016)
*Aishni Parab,Hongjing Lu,Ying Nian Wu,Sumit Gulwani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study evaluates LLM-based hypothesis search and direct program generation for rule induction, revealing the former's superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how to improve program induction methods and model inductive reasoning using computational approaches, particularly through an LLM-based hypothesis search framework.

Method: A comparison of LLM-based hypothesis search with direct program generation approaches in performing few-shot rule induction tasks, alongside an error analysis to understand limitations.

Result: LLM-based hypothesis search performs comparably to human reasoning on rule induction tasks, while direct program generation lags significantly.

Conclusion: LLM-based hypothesis search shows promise for inductive reasoning modeling, but there are challenges that require addressing for more efficient systems.

Abstract: Inductive reasoning enables humans to infer abstract rules from limited
examples and apply them to novel situations. In this work, we compare an
LLM-based hypothesis search framework with direct program generation approaches
on few-shot rule induction tasks. Our findings show that hypothesis search
achieves performance comparable to humans, while direct program generation
falls notably behind. An error analysis reveals key bottlenecks in hypothesis
generation and suggests directions for advancing program induction methods.
Overall, this paper underscores the potential of LLM-based hypothesis search
for modeling inductive reasoning and the challenges in building more efficient
systems.

### [5] [Entropy-Guided Loop: Achieving Reasoning through Uncertainty-Aware Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00079)
*Andrew G. A. Correa,Ana C. H de Matos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a test-time refinement approach using token-level uncertainty metrics to match reasoning model quality while significantly reducing the computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reasoning models are highly expensive, yet their reliable performance makes them indispensable in critical technical queries. There's a need for a cheaper yet high-performing alternative that reduces computational cost.

Method: The authors propose entropy-guided refinement, utilizing token-level uncertainty triggers to identify areas needing correction and performing targeted edits to responses during inference.

Result: Achieves ~95% quality of large reasoning models at only one-third of the computational expense. Selectively refines ~31% of the outputs, boosting accuracy by 16 percentage points.

Conclusion: The approach bridges the gap between single-pass inference and expensive reasoning chains, making high-quality reasoning practical and cost-effective for production environments.

Abstract: Reasoning models often outperform smaller models but at 3--5$\times$ higher
cost and added latency. We present entropy-guided refinement: a lightweight,
test-time loop that uses token-level uncertainty to trigger a single, targeted
refinement pass. We extract logprobs, compute Shannon entropy on top-$k$
alternatives, and apply a simple OR-logic trigger over perplexity, maximum
token entropy, and low-confidence-token count. Unlike approaches that use
entropy only for measurement or decoding, we pass a compact uncertainty report
(tokens, confidences, alternatives, context) back to the model to guide
corrective edits. On representative technical queries across reasoning,
mathematics, and code generation tasks, a small model with our loop approaches
95\% of a reference reasoning model's quality at approximately one-third of the
cost. The method achieves selective refinement on ~31\% of responses while
improving accuracy by 16 percentage points over single-pass inference. We
demonstrate that this uncertainty-aware loop provides an effective middle
ground between single-pass inference and expensive reasoning chains, making it
practical for production deployments where both quality and cost matter.

### [6] [Wrong Face, Wrong Move: The Social Dynamics of Emotion Misperception in Agent-Based Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00080)
*David Freire-Obregón*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study analyzes how emotional perception accuracy impacts social behavior using agents with different emotion classifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how the accuracy of emotional perception influences social behavior in agents, highlighting potential biases and disruptions to cohesion.

Method: Agents were equipped with emotion classifiers trained on various datasets (low, medium, or high accuracy). These agents interacted on a 2D grid by responding to perceived emotions through movement patterns.

Result: Agents with poor classifiers showed diminished trust and disordered social structures, while high-accuracy agents formed cohesive and resilient emotional clusters.

Conclusion: Precision in emotion recognition is crucial for maintaining social cohesion and emotional integration, as inaccuracies can lead to fragmentation and distrust.

Abstract: The ability of humans to detect and respond to others' emotions is
fundamental to understanding social behavior. Here, agents are instantiated
with emotion classifiers of varying accuracy to study the impact of perceptual
accuracy on emergent emotional and spatial behavior. Agents are visually
represented with face photos from the KDEF database and endowed with one of
three classifiers trained on the JAFFE (poor), CK+ (medium), or KDEF (high)
datasets. Agents communicate locally on a 2D toroidal lattice, perceiving
neighbors' emotional state based on their classifier and responding with
movement toward perceived positive emotions and away from perceived negative
emotions. Note that the agents respond to perceived, instead of ground-truth,
emotions, introducing systematic misperception and frustration. A battery of
experiments is carried out on homogeneous and heterogeneous populations and
scenarios with repeated emotional shocks. Results show that low-accuracy
classifiers on the part of the agent reliably result in diminished trust,
emotional disintegration into sadness, and disordered social organization. By
contrast, the agent that develops high accuracy develops hardy emotional
clusters and resilience to emotional disruptions. Even in emotionally neutral
scenarios, misperception is enough to generate segregation and disintegration
of cohesion. These findings underscore the fact that biases or imprecision in
emotion recognition may significantly warp social processes and disrupt
emotional integration.

### [7] [Ensemble Debates with Local Large Language Models for AI Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00091)
*Ephraiem Sarabamoun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper focuses on leveraging local open-source ensemble debates for improving alignment-oriented reasoning in large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to improve alignment with human values for LLMs in high-stakes decisions and to provide accessible, reproducible methodologies rather than relying on proprietary APIs.

Method: The authors use open-source ensemble debates across 150 scenarios with five configurations. They apply a 7-point rubric to compare results against single-model baselines.

Result: Findings showed that ensembles outperform single-model baselines, with major improvements in reasoning depth (+19.4%) and argument quality (+34.1%), and better truthfulness (+1.25 points) and human enhancement (+0.80).

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of ensemble-based approaches, provides tools and data for further research, and emphasizes reproducibility for alignment evaluation.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) take on greater roles in high-stakes
decisions, alignment with human values is essential. Reliance on proprietary
APIs limits reproducibility and broad participation. We study whether local
open-source ensemble debates can improve alignmentoriented reasoning. Across
150 debates spanning 15 scenarios and five ensemble configurations, ensembles
outperform single-model baselines on a 7-point rubric (overall: 3.48 vs. 3.13),
with the largest gains in reasoning depth (+19.4%) and argument quality
(+34.1%). Improvements are strongest for truthfulness (+1.25 points) and human
enhancement (+0.80). We provide code, prompts, and a debate data set, providing
an accessible and reproducible foundation for ensemble-based alignment
evaluation.

### [8] [MODE: Mixture of Document Experts for RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00100)
*Rahul Anand*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces MODE, a cluster-and-route retrieval model for small domain-specific collections, offering high efficiency and accuracy without requiring large vector-database infrastructure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiency of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for small, domain-specific collections by proposing a simpler alternative to large vector databases and cross-encoders.

Method: MODE organizes documents into semantic clusters represented by cached centroids and retrieves data by routing queries to the top relevant clusters, eliminating reliance on external databases and reranking.

Result: MODE achieves comparable or better answer quality on HotpotQA and SQuAD than dense-retrieval baselines while reducing retrieval time.

Conclusion: MODE is an efficient and practical solution for small and medium-sized corpora, where simplicity, speed, and a focus on topical relevance are prioritized.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) often relies on large vector databases
and cross-encoders tuned for large-scale corpora, which can be excessive for
small, domain-specific collections. We present MODE (Mixture of Document
Experts), a lightweight alternative that replaces fine-grained nearest-neighbor
search with cluster-and-route retrieval. Documents are embedded, grouped into
semantically coherent clusters, and represented by cached centroids. At query
time, we route to the top centroid(s) and retrieve context only within those
clusters, eliminating external vector-database infrastructure and reranking
while keeping latency low. On HotpotQA and SQuAD corpora with 100-500 chunks,
MODE matches or exceeds a dense-retrieval baseline in answer quality while
reducing end-to-end retrieval time. Ablations show that cluster granularity and
multi-cluster routing control the recall/precision trade-off, and that tighter
clusters improve downstream accuracy. MODE offers a practical recipe for small
and medium corpora where simplicity, speed, and topical focus matter.

### [9] [Adaptive Monitoring and Real-World Evaluation of Agentic AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00115)
*Manish Shukla*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper focuses on advanced agentic AI systems and introduces an Adaptive Multi-Dimensional Monitoring algorithm (AMDM) to address issues like goal drift and anomaly detection efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agentic AI systems are transitioning to critical domains where robust evaluation methods beyond technical metrics are essential, especially for safety and human-centered goals.

Method: The paper introduces the AMDM algorithm, which standardizes heterogeneous metrics, implements adaptive thresholds, and uses Mahalanobis distance for joint anomaly detection.

Result: AMDM significantly improves anomaly-detection latency (from 12.3s to 5.6s) and reduces false-positive rates (from 4.5% to 0.9% compared to static thresholds).

Conclusion: The work advances the evaluation framework for agentic AI by combining empirical evidence and robust metrics. Accompanying resources like code make the framework replicable.

Abstract: Agentic artificial intelligence (AI) -- multi-agent systems that combine
large language models with external tools and autonomous planning -- are
rapidly transitioning from research laboratories into high-stakes domains. Our
earlier "Basic" paper introduced a five-axis framework and proposed preliminary
metrics such as goal drift and harm reduction but did not provide an
algorithmic instantiation or empirical evidence. This "Advanced" sequel fills
that gap. First, we revisit recent benchmarks and industrial deployments to
show that technical metrics still dominate evaluations: a systematic review of
84 papers from 2023--2025 found that 83% report capability metrics while only
30% consider human-centred or economic axes [2]. Second, we formalise an
Adaptive Multi-Dimensional Monitoring (AMDM) algorithm that normalises
heterogeneous metrics, applies per-axis exponentially weighted moving-average
thresholds and performs joint anomaly detection via the Mahalanobis distance.
Third, we conduct simulations and real-world experiments. AMDM cuts
anomaly-detection latency from 12.3 s to 5.6 s on simulated goal drift and
reduces false-positive rates from 4.5% to 0.9% compared with static thresholds.
We present a comparison table and ROC/PR curves, and we reanalyse case studies
to surface missing metrics. Code, data and a reproducibility checklist
accompany this paper to facilitate replication.

### [10] [Know When to Explore: Difficulty-Aware Certainty as a Guide for LLM Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00125)
*Ang Li,Zhihang Yuan,Yang Zhang,Shouda Liu,Yisen Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces DACE, a novel RL algorithm for improving Large Language Models' reasoning via a dynamic exploration-exploitation technique based on task difficulty and model certainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLVF methods rely on sparse, binary rewards that don't guide the reasoning process, limiting the ability of LLMs to learn efficiently and distinguish solution qualities.

Method: The DACE algorithm assesses task difficulty online using the model's success rate and modulates an intrinsic reward system. It encourages exploration for hard tasks and promotes efficiency for easier ones by penalizing or rewarding the model's self-certainty levels dynamically.

Result: DACE shows superior performance on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME, MATH), outperforming strong baselines in both accuracy and robustness against compute scaling.

Conclusion: DACE facilitates effective exploration without compromising precision, making it a significant advancement in enhancing LLMs' reasoning capabilities through RL.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Feedback (RLVF) has become a key
technique for enhancing the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, its reliance on sparse, outcome based rewards, which only
indicate if a final answer is correct or not, fails to provide granular
guidance on the reasoning process itself. This limitation hinders efficient
learning, as the model cannot distinguish between high quality and inefficient
solutions, nor can it learn effectively from different types of failures. To
address this, we observe that an LLMs self-certainty often correlates with task
difficulty and solution quality. We introduce Difficulty Aware Certainty guided
Exploration (DACE), a novel RL algorithm that leverages this insight to
dynamically balance the exploration exploitation trade-off. DACE assesses task
difficulty online based on the policys success rate. It then uses this signal
to modulate an intrinsic reward: for difficult tasks where the model is
struggling, DACE encourages exploration by penalizing high certainty; for
easier tasks, it encourages learning efficiency by rewarding high certainty.
Experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME, MATH) show
that DACE significantly outperforms strong baselines. The DACE-trained models
not only achieve higher accuracy but also demonstrate more robust performance
when scaling test-time compute, validating that our adaptive approach fosters
effective exploration without sacrificing precision.

### [11] [Optimizing Health Coverage in Ethiopia: A Learning-augmented Approach and Persistent Proportionality Under an Online Budget](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00135)
*Davin Choo,Yohai Trabelsi,Fentabil Getnet,Samson Warkaye Lamma,Wondesen Nigatu,Kasahun Sime,Lisa Matay,Milind Tambe,Stéphane Verguet*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a tool, HARP, to guide health post expansion in Ethiopia for Universal Health Coverage under budget and priority constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To aid Ethiopia's efforts to meet the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 3 by optimizing health post expansion despite budget limits and competing priorities.

Method: The authors developed HARP, an optimization tool using a principled decision-support framework, and proposed two algorithms for facility planning: a learning-augmented one and a greedy algorithm for multi-step planning.

Result: The authors validated the efficacy of their approach by applying it in three Ethiopian regions with support from national health entities.

Conclusion: Their methods can effectively guide sequential health facility planning while adhering to budget and regional proportionality targets.

Abstract: As part of nationwide efforts aligned with the United Nations' Sustainable
Development Goal 3 on Universal Health Coverage, Ethiopia's Ministry of Health
is strengthening health posts to expand access to essential healthcare
services. However, only a fraction of this health system strengthening effort
can be implemented each year due to limited budgets and other competing
priorities, thus the need for an optimization framework to guide prioritization
across the regions of Ethiopia. In this paper, we develop a tool, Health Access
Resource Planner (HARP), based on a principled decision-support optimization
framework for sequential facility planning that aims to maximize population
coverage under budget uncertainty while satisfying region-specific
proportionality targets at every time step. We then propose two algorithms: (i)
a learning-augmented approach that improves upon expert recommendations at any
single-step; and (ii) a greedy algorithm for multi-step planning, both with
strong worst-case approximation estimation. In collaboration with the Ethiopian
Public Health Institute and Ministry of Health, we demonstrated the empirical
efficacy of our method on three regions across various planning scenarios.

### [12] [Virtual Group Knowledge and Group Belief in Topological Evidence Models (Extended Version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00184)
*Alexandru Baltag,Malvin Gattinger,Djanira Gomes*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates group knowledge and belief in multi-agent evidence models, proposing axiomatic systems and demonstrating their decidability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses a need to extend individual concepts of evidence-based belief and knowledge to group-level interactions and dynamics.

Method: Topological semantics of evidence-based belief and knowledge are extended to group contexts. The authors introduce axioms for group evidence and beliefs, including dynamic operators.

Result: Complete axiomatization and proof of decidability for both static and dynamic group evidence and belief logics. The dynamic versions are equivalent to static ones in expressiveness.

Conclusion: The paper provides a formal framework for analyzing group knowledge and belief via static and dynamic logic, contributing significantly to multi-agent systems study.

Abstract: We study notions of (virtual) group knowledge and group belief within
multi-agent evidence models, obtained by extending the topological semantics of
evidence-based belief and fallible knowledge from individuals to groups. We
completely axiomatize and show the decidability of the logic of ("hard" and
"soft") group evidence, and do the same for an especially interesting fragment
of it: the logic of group knowledge and group belief. We also extend these
languages with dynamic evidence-sharing operators, and completely axiomatize
the corresponding logics, showing that they are co-expressive with their static
bases.

### [13] [HiVA: Self-organized Hierarchical Variable Agent via Goal-driven Semantic-Topological Evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00189)
*Jinzhou Tang,Jusheng Zhang,Qinhan Lv,Sidi Liu,Jing Yang,Chengpei Tang,Keze Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces HiVA, a framework that optimizes autonomous agent workflows using a unique algorithm combining semantic and topological modifications, achieving better task accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the major trade-off in autonomous agents: fixed workflows being inflexible in changing environments versus reactive systems failing to create reusable structures.

Method: Utilization of the Semantic-Topological Evolution (STEV) algorithm that integrates Multi-Armed Bandit routing, diagnostic gradient updates from feedback, and hybrid optimization of semantics and topology.

Result: HiVA improved task accuracy by 5-10% in various benchmarks such as dialogue, coding, and long-context Q&A while achieving better resource efficiency compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: HiVA provides a novel method for autonomous task execution by transforming workflows into self-organized graphs optimized for unknown environments, proving its utility in advancing Artificial General Intelligence.

Abstract: Autonomous agents play a crucial role in advancing Artificial General
Intelligence, enabling problem decomposition and tool orchestration through
Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing paradigms face a critical
trade-off. On one hand, reusable fixed workflows require manual reconfiguration
upon environmental changes; on the other hand, flexible reactive loops fail to
distill reasoning progress into transferable structures. We introduce
Hierarchical Variable Agent (HiVA), a novel framework modeling agentic
workflows as self-organized graphs with the Semantic-Topological Evolution
(STEV) algorithm, which optimizes hybrid semantic-topological spaces using
textual gradients as discrete-domain surrogates for backpropagation. The
iterative process comprises Multi-Armed Bandit-infused forward routing,
diagnostic gradient generation from environmental feedback, and coordinated
updates that co-evolve individual semantics and topology for collective
optimization in unknown environments. Experiments on dialogue, coding,
Long-context Q&A, mathematical, and agentic benchmarks demonstrate improvements
of 5-10% in task accuracy and enhanced resource efficiency over existing
baselines, establishing HiVA's effectiveness in autonomous task execution.

### [14] [Universal Deep Research: Bring Your Own Model and Strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00244)
*Peter Belcak,Pavlo Molchanov*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Universal Deep Research (UDR), a flexible system that allows users to design their own custom research strategies using language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep research agents are rigid, as they are hardcoded to specific research strategies and tools, limiting adaptability and customization.

Method: They developed UDR, a wrapper around any language model, enabling users to customize and refine research strategies interactively without additional training or fine-tuning.

Result: The authors demonstrated UDR's flexibility by equipping it with diverse research strategies and providing an interface for user experimentation.

Conclusion: UDR represents a shift towards generalist and user-customizable agentic systems, broadening the scope of research applications while eliminating training constraints.

Abstract: Deep research tools are among the most impactful and most commonly
encountered agentic systems today. We observe, however, that each deep research
agent introduced so far is hard-coded to carry out a particular research
strategy using a fixed choice of tools. We introduce Universal Deep Research
(UDR), a generalist agentic system that wraps around any language model and
enables the user to create, edit, and refine their own entirely custom deep
research strategies without any need for additional training or finetuning. To
showcase the generality of our system, we equip UDR with example minimal,
expansive, and intensive research strategies, and provide a user interface to
facilitate experimentation with the system.

### [15] [Instruction-Level Weight Shaping: A Framework for Self-Improving AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00251)
*Rimom Costa*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Instruction-Level Weight Shaping (ILWS), a method enabling large language models (LLMs) to adapt dynamically using curated system instructions updated via reflection and user feedback, offering significant operational improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to updating large language models pose challenges like high latency, brittleness, and potential for catastrophic forgetting. This paper aims to create a method that integrates new knowledge efficiently while addressing these challenges.

Method: The proposed ILWS updates curated instructions (pseudo-parameters) after each session using a Reflection Engine. This engine evaluates model performance through conversation traces, applies updates (deltas) to instructions, and compiles these changes periodically into the model weights without downtime.

Result: ILWS demonstrated significant improvements in enterprise support, such as 2.4-5.0x throughput increase and an 80% reduction in hallucinations, compared to static models. In proof-of-concept tests, it also achieved 4-5x higher efficiency and faster ticket processing with autonomous updates.

Conclusion: ILWS enables dynamic adaptation in LLMs while preserving governance and auditability. It is especially suited for dynamic domains requiring fast knowledge integration and low-latency applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are fluent but largely static after
pre-training; new or shifting knowledge is typically added with
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) or fine-tuning. RAG raises latency and
engineering overhead and often fails to integrate facts; prompt engineering is
brittle and can conflict with prior knowledge; fine-tuning is costly and risks
catastrophic forgetting. We propose Instruction-Level Weight Shaping (ILWS):
curated system instructions act as external, auditable pseudo-parameters
updated after each session via reflection and user feedback. A Reflection
Engine inspects conversation traces, diagnoses reasoning successes and
failures, and proposes typed deltas $\Delta K=(\Delta S,\Delta U,\Delta T)$
over instructions, user preferences, and tools. Deltas are version-controlled,
evaluated with a sliding window of 1-5 star ratings, auto-repaired on first
failure, and rolled back on repeated failure. When an edit budget crosses a
threshold, the agent compiles a rating-weighted synthetic set and distills
matured instruction-space gains into parameters, converting prompt-space
improvements into weight-space without downtime. ILWS makes explicit the
low-rank shaping induced by context in transformer blocks, preserves
governance, and removes per-call retrieval. In enterprise support it increased
throughput 2.4-5.0x and cut audited hallucinations by about 80% versus a frozen
baseline. In an Adobe Commerce Cloud proof of concept "L0 Support", it achieved
4-5x more tickets per hour and about 80% lower time per ticket, with autonomous
instruction updates and optional tool synthesis. Because ILWS operates at the
instruction layer until controlled distillation, it generalizes to dynamic
domains (legal, medical, engineering) requiring adaptive reasoning, tool
creation, and low-latency deployment.

*Boqi Chen,Kua Chen,José Antonio Hernández López,Gunter Mussbacher,Dániel Varró,Amir Feizpour*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces SHERPA, a framework that utilizes hierarchical state machines to structure the reasoning abilities of large language models, offering improved performance on complex tasks by embedding domain-specific best practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models lack structured reasoning abilities for complex tasks, especially those requiring domain-specific best practices absent in their training data.

Method: The authors propose SHERPA, a framework that uses hierarchical state machines to structure LLM execution processes, ensuring controlled behavior by combining rules, decisions, and machine learning approaches.

Result: SHERPA improves the performance of LLMs in tasks like code generation, class name generation, and question answering, as shown through systematic evaluations across different state machine configurations.

Conclusion: Integrating hierarchical state machines can significantly enhance the capabilities of LLMs, particularly in complex tasks influenced by domain-specific human best practices.

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved widespread application
across various fields. Despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs suffer from
a lack of structured reasoning ability, particularly for complex tasks
requiring domain-specific best practices, which are often unavailable in the
training data. Although multi-step prompting methods incorporating human best
practices, such as chain-of-thought and tree-of-thought, have gained
popularity, they lack a general mechanism to control LLM behavior. In this
paper, we propose SHERPA, a model-driven framework to improve the LLM
performance on complex tasks by explicitly incorporating domain-specific best
practices into hierarchical state machines. By structuring the LLM execution
processes using state machines, SHERPA enables more fine-grained control over
their behavior via rules or decisions driven by machine learning-based
approaches, including LLMs. We show that SHERPA is applicable to a wide variety
of tasks-specifically, code generation, class name generation, and question
answering-replicating previously proposed approaches while further improving
the performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SHERPA for the
aforementioned tasks using various LLMs. Our systematic evaluation compares
different state machine configurations against baseline approaches without
state machines. Results show that integrating well-designed state machines
significantly improves the quality of LLM outputs, and is particularly
beneficial for complex tasks with well-established human best practices but
lacking data used for training LLMs.

### [17] [SIGMUS: Semantic Integration for Knowledge Graphs in Multimodal Urban Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00287)
*Brian Wang,Mani Srivastava*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents SIGMUS, a system that uses Large Language Models to integrate multimodal data about urban incidents into a knowledge graph, enabling meaningful insights without relying on predefined human rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban incidents such as emergencies, events, and disasters require integration of diverse multimodal data for understanding and forecasting, which is currently challenging due to fragmentation and reliance on human reasoning.

Method: The authors develop SIGMUS, leveraging Large Language Models to semantically integrate multimodal data sources (text, images, air quality, weather, traffic) into a unified knowledge graph.

Result: SIGMUS successfully created meaningful relationships between multimodal urban data and incidents, demonstrating the system’s ability to organize and integrate evidence across 5 data sources.

Conclusion: LLMs can effectively reduce the reliance on human-driven reasoning for multimodal data integration, enabling scalable analysis of urban incidents through knowledge graphs.

Abstract: Modern urban spaces are equipped with an increasingly diverse set of sensors,
all producing an abundance of multimodal data. Such multimodal data can be used
to identify and reason about important incidents occurring in urban landscapes,
such as major emergencies, cultural and social events, as well as natural
disasters. However, such data may be fragmented over several sources and
difficult to integrate due to the reliance on human-driven reasoning for
identifying relationships between the multimodal data corresponding to an
incident, as well as understanding the different components which define an
incident. Such relationships and components are critical to identifying the
causes of such incidents, as well as producing forecasting the scale and
intensity of future incidents as they begin to develop. In this work, we create
SIGMUS, a system for Semantic Integration for Knowledge Graphs in Multimodal
Urban Spaces. SIGMUS uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce the necessary
world knowledge for identifying relationships between incidents occurring in
urban spaces and data from different modalities, allowing us to organize
evidence and observations relevant to an incident without relying and
human-encoded rules for relating multimodal sensory data with incidents. This
organized knowledge is represented as a knowledge graph, organizing incidents,
observations, and much more. We find that our system is able to produce
reasonable connections between 5 different data sources (new article text, CCTV
images, air quality, weather, and traffic measurements) and relevant incidents
occurring at the same time and location.

### [18] [NEWSAGENT: Benchmarking Multimodal Agents as Journalists with Real-World Newswriting Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00446)
*Yen-Che Chien,Kuang-Da Wang,Wei-Yao Wang,Wen-Chih Peng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces NEWSAGENT, a benchmark for evaluating how autonomous agents perform journalistic tasks involving multimodal web data processing. The study finds that agents are good at fact-retrieval but struggle with planning and narration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential and current limitations of autonomous digital agents in improving productivity in journalism, a demanding domain requiring contextual reasoning and iterative task decomposition.

Method: The researchers developed NEWSAGENT, a benchmark comprising 6,000 human-verified examples of raw multimodal data converted into text. Agents are tasked with activities such as narrative construction, keyword querying, and complete article generation.

Result: Agents demonstrated proficiency in retrieving relevant facts but faced challenges in narrative construction and iterative planning, highlighting gaps in their practical usability for journalistic applications.

Conclusion: NEWSAGENT establishes itself as a vital testbed for assessing and improving the capabilities of digital agents in processing multimodal web data for real-world applications such as journalism.

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous digital agents from industry (e.g., Manus AI
and Gemini's research mode) highlight potential for structured tasks by
autonomous decision-making and task decomposition; however, it remains unclear
to what extent the agent-based systems can improve multimodal web data
productivity. We study this in the realm of journalism, which requires
iterative planning, interpretation, and contextual reasoning from multimodal
raw contents to form a well structured news. We introduce NEWSAGENT, a
benchmark for evaluating how agents can automatically search available raw
contents, select desired information, and edit and rephrase to form a news
article by accessing core journalistic functions. Given a writing instruction
and firsthand data as how a journalist initiates a news draft, agents are
tasked to identify narrative perspectives, issue keyword-based queries,
retrieve historical background, and generate complete articles. Unlike typical
summarization or retrieval tasks, essential context is not directly available
and must be actively discovered, reflecting the information gaps faced in
real-world news writing. NEWSAGENT includes 6k human-verified examples derived
from real news, with multimodal contents converted to text for broad model
compatibility. We evaluate open- and closed-sourced LLMs with commonly-used
agentic frameworks on NEWSAGENT, which shows that agents are capable of
retrieving relevant facts but struggling with planning and narrative
integration. We believe that NEWSAGENT serves a realistic testbed for iterating
and evaluating agent capabilities in terms of multimodal web data manipulation
to real-world productivity.

Abstract: Recent advancements in the field of AI agents have impacted the way we work,
enabling greater automation and collaboration between humans and agents. In the
data visualization field, multi-agent systems can be useful for employing
agents throughout the entire data-to-communication pipeline. We present a
lightweight multi-agent system that automates the data analysis workflow, from
data exploration to generating coherent visual narratives for insight
communication. Our approach combines a hybrid multi-agent architecture with
deterministic components, strategically externalizing critical logic from LLMs
to improve transparency and reliability. The system delivers granular, modular
outputs that enable surgical modifications without full regeneration,
supporting sustainable human-AI collaboration. We evaluated our system across 4
diverse datasets, demonstrating strong generalizability, narrative quality, and
computational efficiency with minimal dependencies.

### [20] [Artificial Intelligence-Based Analysis of Ice Cream Melting Behavior Under Various Ingredients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00507)
*Zhang Lai Bin,Zhen Bin It*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study evaluates the impact of different stabilizers on ice cream's melting resistance and structural integrity using locust bean gum, guar gum, maltodextrin, and carrageenan.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance ice cream quality and consumer acceptance by improving melting stability and identifying cost-effective stabilizers.

Method: Ice cream samples with various stabilizers were prepared, analyzed for their melting behavior using timelapse recordings, and evaluated with Python and OpenCV.

Result: The stabilizers improved the formation of a stable air-cell matrix, retained foam structure even after melting, and showed increased sturdiness upon refreezing.

Conclusion: The study highlights the effectiveness of different stabilizers in balancing melting resistance, structural properties, and economic feasibility for practical ice cream production.

Abstract: The stability of ice cream during melting is a critical factor for consumer's
acceptance and product quality. With the commonly added stabilizer to improve
texture, structure and slower melting as the factors to analyze. This report
explores the effects of locust bean gum, guar gum, maltodextrin, and
carrageenan on the melting behavior of homemade ice cream. The main objective
was to assess how these additives influence melting resistance and to identify
a more cost-effective recipe formulation. Ice cream samples incorporating each
additive were prepared and subjected to melting tests under controlled
conditions. Timelapse recordings were used to capture and analyze the
progression of melting over time. Python and OpenCV is used for process and
analysis. Observations revealed that all samples retained a foam-like structure
even after melting, suggesting the stabilizers contributed to the formation of
a stable air-cell matrix. Furthermore, when the melted samples were re-frozen
and subsequently melted again, they displayed increased sturdiness, indicating
improved resilience of the ice cream structure. Comparative analysis of the
different stabilizers highlighted variations in their effectiveness, with some
offering stronger melting resistance and structural support than others.
Overall, the findings provide insights into the functional roles of commonly
used food additives in ice cream formulation. By evaluating both performance
and cost, this study demonstrates the potential for developing recipes that
balance durability with economic efficiency, contributing to practical
applications in both small-scale and commercial ice cream production.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the SuperBrain framework to enable scalable, explainable, and ethically aligned collective AI through collaborative interactions between humans and large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create a dynamic and scalable framework for collective intelligence that blends human input and large language models while overcoming limitations associated with static approaches.

Method: SuperBrain employs persistent human-LLM interactions, GA-assisted iterative refinements, swarm intelligence for coordination, and integration into a meta-intelligence called Superclass Brain.

Result: Initial implementations include UAV scheduling and keyword filtering tasks, demonstrating the framework's feasibility.

Conclusion: This approach lays a conceptual groundwork and offers an architectural path for achieving advanced collective AI systems capable of abstraction and self-improvement.

Abstract: We propose a novel SuperBrain framework for collective intelligence, grounded
in the co-evolution of large language models (LLMs) and human users. Unlike
static prompt engineering or isolated agent simulations, our approach
emphasizes a dynamic pathway from Subclass Brain to Superclass Brain: (1) A
Subclass Brain arises from persistent, personalized interaction between a user
and an LLM, forming a cognitive dyad with adaptive learning memory. (2) Through
GA-assisted forward-backward evolution, these dyads iteratively refine prompts
and task performance. (3) Multiple Subclass Brains coordinate via Swarm
Intelligence, optimizing across multi-objective fitness landscapes and
exchanging distilled heuristics. (4) Their standardized behaviors and cognitive
signatures integrate into a Superclass Brain, an emergent meta-intelligence
capable of abstraction, generalization and self-improvement. We outline the
theoretical constructs, present initial implementations (e.g., UAV scheduling,
KU/KI keyword filtering) and propose a registry for cross-dyad knowledge
consolidation. This work provides both a conceptual foundation and an
architectural roadmap toward scalable, explainable and ethically aligned
collective AI.

Motivation: To automate the process of drafting architectural floor plans by transforming natural language prompts into structured layouts with minimal manual effort.

Method: The workflow involves LLM-based interpretation of text prompts, a furniture placement refinement algorithm, prompt engineering, and Python scripting to produce spatially-coherent draft plans.

Result: The method reliably generated functional and structured residential layout drafts through a case study, demonstrating its integration ability into professional design workflows via Revit.

TL;DR: This paper introduces S3AP, a structured representation for AI systems to better reason about social interactions, achieving significant improvements in social reasoning tasks and agent decision-making benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI systems often struggle with understanding and reasoning about implicit social dynamics, unlike humans who navigate them intuitively.

Method: A structured representation framework called S3AP (using POMDP-driven design) to represent social interactions as tuples like state, observation, actions, and mental states, combined with inducing representations from narratives.

Result: Demonstrated +51% improvement in theory-of-mind reasoning tasks for LLMs and up to +18% enhancement on the SOTOPIA social interaction benchmark through improved prediction and decision-making capabilities.

Conclusion: S3AP represents a promising step toward creating AI systems capable of effectively understanding and navigating complex social interactions.

Abstract: Humans intuitively navigate social interactions by simulating unspoken
dynamics and reasoning about others' perspectives, even with limited
information. In contrast, AI systems struggle to automatically structure and
reason about these implicit social contexts. In this paper, we introduce a
novel structured social world representation formalism (S3AP), designed to help
AI systems reason more effectively about social dynamics. Following a
POMDP-driven design, S3AP represents social interactions as structured tuples,
such as state, observation, agent actions, and mental states, which can be
automatically induced from free-form narratives or other inputs. We first show
S3AP can help LLMs better understand social narratives across 5 social
reasoning tasks (e.g., +51% improvement on FANToM's theory-of-mind reasoning
with OpenAI's o1), reaching new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. We then
induce social world models from these structured representations, demonstrating
their ability to predict future social dynamics and improve agent
decision-making, yielding up to +18% improvement on the SOTOPIA social
interaction benchmark. Our findings highlight the promise of S3AP as a
powerful, general-purpose representation for social world states, enabling the
development of more socially-aware systems that better navigate social
interactions.

*Shiqiao Zhou,Holger Schöner,Huanbo Lyu,Edouard Fouché,Shuo Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BALM-TSF is a lightweight framework addressing modality imbalance in multimodal time series forecasting by balancing textual and temporal data for improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the challenge of modality imbalance in multimodal time series forecasting, where current architectures often favor one modality over another, leading to information loss and reduced forecasting accuracy.

Method: BALM-TSF processes raw time series with a time series encoder and descriptive statistics with an LLM using learnable prompts. A balanced cross-modal alignment is achieved through a scaling strategy and a contrastive objective to integrate embeddings into a joint forecasting model.

Result: Extensive experimentation demonstrates BALM-TSF achieves state-of-the-art performance in both long-term forecasting and few-shot forecasting with minimal trainable parameters.

Conclusion: BALM-TSF showcases the potential of balancing text and time series data to enhance forecasting accuracy, validating the complementary nature of the multimodal approach.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is a long-standing and highly challenging research
topic. Recently, driven by the rise of large language models (LLMs), research
has increasingly shifted from purely time series methods toward harnessing
textual modalities to enhance forecasting performance. However, the vast
discrepancy between text and temporal data often leads current multimodal
architectures to over-emphasise one modality while neglecting the other,
resulting in information loss that harms forecasting performance. To address
this modality imbalance, we introduce BALM-TSF (Balanced Multimodal Alignment
for LLM-Based Time Series Forecasting), a lightweight time series forecasting
framework that maintains balance between the two modalities. Specifically, raw
time series are processed by the time series encoder, while descriptive
statistics of raw time series are fed to an LLM with learnable prompt,
producing compact textual embeddings. To ensure balanced cross-modal context
alignment of time series and textual embeddings, a simple yet effective scaling
strategy combined with a contrastive objective then maps these textual
embeddings into the latent space of the time series embeddings. Finally, the
aligned textual semantic embeddings and time series embeddings are together
integrated for forecasting. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show
that, with minimal trainable parameters, BALM-TSF achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both long-term and few-shot forecasting, confirming its ability
to harness complementary information from text and time series. Code is

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NetGent is an AI framework to automate app workflows, enabling scalable generation of realistic and diverse network traffic datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing generalizable ML models for networking requires realistic and diverse network traffic data, which current browser tools fail to efficiently provide.

Method: NetGent uses natural-language rules turned into NDFA models to automate application workflows, enabling efficient and deterministic code execution for dataset generation.

Result: NetGent successfully automated 50+ workflows across various domains, generating realistic traffic traces and showcasing adaptability to interface changes.

Conclusion: NetGent is a scalable and robust solution for creating diverse and repeatable datasets essential for advancing ML models in networking.

Abstract: We present NetGent, an AI-agent framework for automating complex application
workflows to generate realistic network traffic datasets. Developing
generalizable ML models for networking requires data collection from network
environments with traffic that results from a diverse set of real-world web
applications. However, using existing browser automation tools that are
diverse, repeatable, realistic, and efficient remains fragile and costly.
NetGent addresses this challenge by allowing users to specify workflows as
natural-language rules that define state-dependent actions. These abstract
specifications are compiled into nondeterministic finite automata (NFAs), which
a state synthesis component translates into reusable, executable code. This
design enables deterministic replay, reduces redundant LLM calls through state
caching, and adapts quickly when application interfaces change. In experiments,
NetGent automated more than 50+ workflows spanning video-on-demand streaming,
live video streaming, video conferencing, social media, and web scraping,
producing realistic traffic traces while remaining robust to UI variability. By
combining the flexibility of language-based agents with the reliability of
compiled execution, NetGent provides a scalable foundation for generating the
diverse, repeatable datasets needed to advance ML in networking.

*Albert Sadowski,Jarosław A. Chudziak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a modular multi-agent framework for legal reasoning that improves transparency, efficiency, and accuracy in AI systems using knowledge representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of precise statutory interpretation and consistent application of complex legal rules faced by AI systems.

Method: The framework decomposes legal reasoning into two stages: extracting legal concepts and formalizing rules, followed by mapping case facts, symbolic inference, and generating answers programmatically.

Result: The approach improves performance in statutory tax calculation tasks, increasing accuracy to 76.4% from a baseline of 18.8%.

Conclusion: Modular architectures and formalized knowledge representations enhance transparency, accessibility, and trustworthiness in AI legal reasoning systems.

Abstract: Legal reasoning requires both precise interpretation of statutory language
and consistent application of complex rules, presenting significant challenges
for AI systems. This paper introduces a modular multi-agent framework that
decomposes legal reasoning into distinct knowledge acquisition and application
stages. In the first stage, specialized agents extract legal concepts and
formalize rules to create verifiable intermediate representations of statutes.
The second stage applies this knowledge to specific cases through three steps:
analyzing queries to map case facts onto the ontology schema, performing
symbolic inference to derive logically entailed conclusions, and generating
final answers using a programmatic implementation that operationalizes the
ontological knowledge. This bridging of natural language understanding with
symbolic reasoning provides explicit and verifiable inspection points,
significantly enhancing transparency compared to end-to-end approaches.
Evaluation on statutory tax calculation tasks demonstrates substantial
improvements, with foundational models achieving 76.4\% accuracy compared to
18.8\% baseline performance, effectively narrowing the performance gap between
reasoning and foundational models. These findings suggest that modular
architectures with formalized knowledge representations can make sophisticated
legal reasoning more accessible through computationally efficient models while
enhancing consistency and explainability in AI legal reasoning, establishing a
foundation for future research into more transparent, trustworthy, and
effective AI systems for legal domain.

*Zakaria El Jaafari*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper analyzes scale-dependent risks and mitigation strategies for Monte Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimization (MCCFR) with neural networks and proposes an adaptive framework to improve its performance in solving extensive-form games.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MCCFR algorithms face challenges when scaled with deep neural networks, notably in addressing risks like nonstationary target distributions and action support collapse, which vary based on game scale.

Method: The authors propose the Robust Deep MCCFR framework, which includes mechanisms like target networks with delayed updates, variance-aware training, and diagnostic monitoring, tailored for mitigating scale-dependent risks. They validate their approach through ablation studies on Kuhn and Leduc Poker.

Result: The framework achieves a 60% improvement in exploitability on Kuhn Poker, reaching 0.0628, and a 23.5% improvement on Leduc Poker, reducing exploitability to 0.2386.

Conclusion: The study underscores the importance of scale-aware component deployment in neural MCCFR, offering theoretical analyses, empirically validated strategies, and practical guidelines for improved performance in larger extensive-form games.

Abstract: Monte Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimization (MCCFR) has emerged as a
cornerstone algorithm for solving extensive-form games, but its integration
with deep neural networks introduces scale-dependent challenges that manifest
differently across game complexities. This paper presents a comprehensive
analysis of how neural MCCFR component effectiveness varies with game scale and
proposes an adaptive framework for selective component deployment. We identify
that theoretical risks such as nonstationary target distribution shifts, action
support collapse, variance explosion, and warm-starting bias have
scale-dependent manifestation patterns, requiring different mitigation
strategies for small versus large games. Our proposed Robust Deep MCCFR
framework incorporates target networks with delayed updates, uniform
exploration mixing, variance-aware training objectives, and comprehensive
diagnostic monitoring. Through systematic ablation studies on Kuhn and Leduc
Poker, we demonstrate scale-dependent component effectiveness and identify
critical component interactions. The best configuration achieves final
exploitability of 0.0628 on Kuhn Poker, representing a 60% improvement over the
classical framework (0.156). On the more complex Leduc Poker domain, selective
component usage achieves exploitability of 0.2386, a 23.5% improvement over the
classical framework (0.3703) and highlighting the importance of careful
component selection over comprehensive mitigation. Our contributions include:
(1) a formal theoretical analysis of risks in neural MCCFR, (2) a principled
mitigation framework with convergence guarantees, (3) comprehensive multi-scale
experimental validation revealing scale-dependent component interactions, and
(4) practical guidelines for deployment in larger games.

*Junzhe Chen,Tianshu Zhang,Shiyu Huang,Yuwei Niu,Chao Sun,Rongzhou Zhang,Guanyu Zhou,Lijie Wen,Xuming Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces OmniDPO, a framework reducing hallucinations in Omni-modal Large Language Models (OLLMs) by enhancing audio-video interaction understanding and multimodal grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Although OLLMs perform well in multimodal tasks, they often prioritize text cues over other modalities and fail to consider audio-video correlations, leading to hallucinations.

Method: OmniDPO employs two strategies: creating text-preference and multimodal-preference sample pairs to improve audio-video interaction understanding and multimodal alignment.

Result: OmniDPO significantly reduces multimodal hallucinations and improves reasoning capabilities in OLLMs, supported by experimental results.

Conclusion: OmniDPO successfully addresses multimodal hallucination challenges in OLLMs, enhancing their grounding and reasoning across modalities.

Abstract: Recently, Omni-modal large language models (OLLMs) have sparked a new wave of
research, achieving impressive results in tasks such as audio-video
understanding and real-time environment perception. However, hallucination
issues still persist. Similar to the bimodal setting, the priors from the text
modality tend to dominate, leading OLLMs to rely more heavily on textual cues
while neglecting visual and audio information. In addition, fully multimodal
scenarios introduce new challenges. Most existing models align visual or
auditory modalities with text independently during training, while ignoring the
intrinsic correlations between video and its corresponding audio. This
oversight results in hallucinations when reasoning requires interpreting hidden
audio cues embedded in video content. To address these challenges, we propose
OmniDPO, a preference-alignment framework designed to mitigate hallucinations
in OLLMs. Specifically, OmniDPO incorporates two strategies: (1) constructing
text-preference sample pairs to enhance the model's understanding of
audio-video interactions; and (2) constructing multimodal-preference sample
pairs to strengthen the model's attention to visual and auditory information.
By tackling both challenges, OmniDPO effectively improves multimodal grounding
and reduces hallucination. Experiments conducted on two OLLMs demonstrate that
OmniDPO not only effectively mitigates multimodal hallucinations but also
significantly enhances the models' reasoning capabilities across modalities.

### [29] [Efficient Graph Understanding with LLMs via Structured Context Injection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00740)
*Govind Waghmare,Sumedh BG,Sonia Gupta,Srikanta Bedathur*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces structured context injection as a cost-efficient strategy to improve LLM performance on graph-related tasks without fine-tuning, achieving scalable and effective results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with graph problems unless task information is grounded conceptually; fine-tuning or repeated queries are costly solutions.

Method: Task-specific structured context is embedded into LLM inputs to guide problem-solving without requiring model fine-tuning.

Result: The proposed method improves performance on various graph tasks across lightweight and larger models, achieving results comparable to or surpassing fine-tuning approaches.

Conclusion: Structured context injection provides an effective and scalable alternative for enabling graph reasoning in LLMs, with consistent performance improvements and cost efficiency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in solving
problems across domains, including graph-related tasks traditionally addressed
by symbolic or algorithmic methods. In this work, we present a framework for
structured context injection, where task-specific information is systematically
embedded in the input to guide LLMs in solving a wide range of graph problems.
Our method does not require fine-tuning of LLMs, making it cost-efficient and
lightweight. We observe that certain graph reasoning tasks remain challenging
for LLMs unless they are mapped to conceptually grounded representations.
However, achieving such mappings through fine-tuning or repeated multi-step
querying can be expensive and inefficient. Our approach offers a practical
alternative by injecting structured context directly into the input, enabling
the LLM to implicitly align the task with grounded conceptual spaces. We
evaluate the approach on multiple graph tasks using both lightweight and large
models, highlighting the trade-offs between accuracy and computational cost.
The results demonstrate consistent performance improvements, showing that
structured input context can rival or surpass more complex approaches. Our
findings underscore the value of structured context injection as an effective
and scalable strategy for graph understanding with LLMs.

*Ziqi Wang,Boqin Yuan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: L-MARS introduces a coordinated multi-agent system to enhance accuracy and reliability in legal question answering by decomposing queries, performing targeted searches across diverse sources, and verifying answers through iterative reasoning processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address hallucination and uncertainty in legal question answering, especially given the necessity for precision and grounding in authoritative law in high-stakes domains.

Method: The authors introduce L-MARS, a system that breaks down legal queries into subproblems, integrates information retrieval from various heterogeneous sources, and uses a Judge Agent to verify the coherence, sufficiency, and validity of answers. The system operates in iterative reasoning, searching, and verification loops.

Result: L-MARS outperforms other methods in factual accuracy, lowers uncertainty, and receives higher preference ratings from both human experts and LLM-based judges when tested on a new benchmark of 200 legal multiple-choice questions.

Conclusion: Multi-agent reasoning with agentic search provides a scalable framework for applying LLMs effectively in domains like law, which demand high levels of precision and deliberation in information retrieval.

Abstract: We present L-MARS (Legal Multi-Agent Workflow with Orchestrated Reasoning and
Agentic Search), a system that reduces hallucination and uncertainty in legal
question answering through coordinated multi-agent reasoning and retrieval.
Unlike single-pass retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), L-MARS decomposes
queries into subproblems, issues targeted searches across heterogeneous sources
(Serper web, local RAG, CourtListener case law), and employs a Judge Agent to
verify sufficiency, jurisdiction, and temporal validity before answer
synthesis. This iterative reasoning-search-verification loop maintains
coherence, filters noisy evidence, and grounds answers in authoritative law. We
evaluated L-MARS on LegalSearchQA, a new benchmark of 200 up-to-date multiple
choice legal questions in 2025. Results show that L-MARS substantially improves
factual accuracy, reduces uncertainty, and achieves higher preference scores
from both human experts and LLM-based judges. Our work demonstrates that
multi-agent reasoning with agentic search offers a scalable and reproducible
blueprint for deploying LLMs in high-stakes domains requiring precise legal
retrieval and deliberation.

*Lee Hyun,Sohee Yoon,Jinwoo Park,Sue In Chae,Seongeon Park,Jooyeon Ahn,Yebin Jung,Youjung Chung,Hogeun Chang,Myeonginn Kang,Jina Kim,Ho-Gyeong Kim,Myeonghun Jeong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Physics-aware Rejection Sampling (PaRS) to improve the reasoning capabilities of large reasoning models (LRMs) for AI-driven materials discovery, ensuring physical admissibility and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-driven materials discovery requires accurate, calibrated, and physically admissible predictors for recipe-to-property relationships, necessitating improved reasoning capability in language models.

Method: The paper introduces Physics-aware Rejection Sampling (PaRS), which selects training traces consistent with physics principles and numerical proximity to targets while controlling compute via lightweight halting.

Result: PaRS improves model accuracy, calibration, reduces physics-violation rates, and lowers sampling costs compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The integration of domain-aware constraints and trace-level selection offers a practical pathway to developing reliable and efficient LRMs for materials discovery and closed-loop design.

Abstract: AI-driven materials discovery that couples automated experimentation with
algorithmic decision-making requires process aware recipe to property
predictors that are accurate, calibrated, and physically admissible. We
approach this as a reasoning problem with large reasoning models (LRMs). To
instill reasoning capability into language models, we curate reasoning traces
from a teacher model to train a student model. However, most training pipelines
select reasoning traces using binary correctness or learned preference signals
that poorly reflect physical admissibility. We introduce Physics-aware
Rejection Sampling (PaRS), a training-time trace selection scheme that favors
traces consistent with fundamental physics and numerically close to targets,
with lightweight halting to control compute. We instantiate our framework with
a large student model fine-tuned on traces synthesized by a larger teacher
model, and evaluate under matched token budgets against various rejection
sampling baselines. Our method improves accuracy and calibration, reduces
physics-violation rates, and lowers sampling cost relative to baselines. These
results indicate that modest, domain-aware constraints combined with
trace-level selection provide a practical path toward reliable, efficient LRMs
for process-aware property prediction and closed-loop materials design.

### [32] [Sharpe Ratio Optimization in Markov Decision Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00793)
*Shuai Ma,Guangwu Liu,Li Xia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenging task of optimizing the Sharpe ratio in Markov decision processes (MDPs), providing a solution using dynamic programming approaches that overcome key obstacles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address two key challenges in Sharpe ratio optimization within MDPs: dynamic programming does not traditionally work for fractional objectives like the Sharpe ratio and struggles to handle risk metrics.

Method: The authors address the fractional objective issue using the Dinkelbach's transform to convert the Sharpe ratio optimization into a mean-squared-variance (M2V) problem. For risk metrics, they introduce an iterative algorithm to solve M2V optimization, employing a policy iteration procedure for both average and discounted MDP scenarios.

Result: Their proposed algorithm demonstrates monotonic improvement in Sharpe ratios, converging to the optimal value. Numerical experiments validate the approach, showing its efficacy in solving Sharpe ratio optimization problems.

Conclusion: The study presents the first dynamic programming-style algorithm for Sharpe ratio optimization in MDPs, providing insights that may be applicable to other fractional objectives in similar problems.

Abstract: Sharpe ratio (also known as reward-to-variability ratio) is a widely-used
metric in finance, which measures the additional return at the cost of per unit
of increased risk (standard deviation of return). However, the optimization of
Sharpe ratio in Markov decision processes (MDPs) is challenging, because there
exist two difficulties hindering the application of dynamic programming. One is
that dynamic programming does not work for fractional objectives, and the other
is that dynamic programming is invalid for risk metrics. In this paper, we
study the Sharpe ratio optimization in infinite-horizon MDPs, considering both
the long-run average and discounted settings. We address the first challenge
with the Dinkelbachs transform, which converts the Sharpe ratio objective to a
mean-squared-variance (M2V) objective. It is shown that the M2V optimization
and the original Sharpe ratio optimization share the same optimal policy when
the risk-sensitive parameter is equal to the optimal Sharpe ratio. For the
second challenge, we develop an iterative algorithm to solve the M2V
optimization which is similar to a mean-variance optimization in MDPs. We
iteratively solve the M2V problem and obtain the associated Sharpe ratio that
is used to update the risk-sensitive parameter in the next iteration of M2V
problems. We show that such a sequence of Sharpe ratios derived is
monotonically increasing and converges to the optimal Sharpe ratio. For both
average and discounted MDP settings, we develop a policy iteration procedure
and prove its convergence to the optimum. Numerical experiments are conducted
for validation. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first that
solves the Sharpe ratio optimization in MDPs with dynamic programming type
algorithms. We believe that the proposed algorithm can shed light on solving
MDPs with other fractional objectives.

*Axel Mezini,Elena Umili,Ivan Donadello,Fabrizio Maria Maggi,Matteo Mancanelli,Fabio Patrizi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Neuro-Symbolic Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) approach, combining deep learning and logical constraints to improve suffix predictions for BPM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning models for suffix prediction often neglect logical constraints, leading to issues with accuracy and logical consistency. The authors aim to solve this by integrating domain knowledge using temporal logic.

Method: The method incorporates Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces (LTLf) into autoregressive sequence predictors with a differentiable logical loss function. This uses soft approximations of LTLf semantics and the Gumbel-Softmax trick, combining logical and predictive losses during training.

Result: Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate improved suffix prediction accuracy and adherence to temporal constraints. The paper introduces two logic loss variants (local and global) and proves their effectiveness under noisy conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully integrates logical constraints into predictive models for BPM, improving accuracy and logical consistency. It has broader applicability in symbolic sequence generation tasks and contributes to Neuro-Symbolic AI advancements.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of suffix prediction in Business Process
Management (BPM) by proposing a Neuro-Symbolic Predictive Process Monitoring
(PPM) approach that integrates data-driven learning with temporal logic-based
prior knowledge. While recent approaches leverage deep learning models for
suffix prediction, they often fail to satisfy even basic logical constraints
due to the absence of explicit integration of domain knowledge during training.
We propose a novel method to incorporate Linear Temporal Logic over finite
traces (LTLf) into the training process of autoregressive sequence predictors.
Our approach introduces a differentiable logical loss function, defined using a
soft approximation of LTLf semantics and the Gumbel-Softmax trick, which can be
combined with standard predictive losses. This ensures the model learns to
generate suffixes that are both accurate and logically consistent. Experimental
evaluation on three real-world datasets shows that our method improves suffix
prediction accuracy and compliance with temporal constraints. We also introduce
two variants of the logic loss (local and global) and demonstrate their
effectiveness under noisy and realistic settings. While developed in the
context of BPM, our framework is applicable to any symbolic sequence generation
task and contributes toward advancing Neuro-Symbolic AI.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ChatCLIDS is an evaluation framework for assessing the capability of LLMs in persuasive dialogue aimed at health behavior change, highlighting their limitations under realistic social pressures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite technical success, adoption of closed-loop insulin systems for Type 1 diabetes is hindered by behavioral and psychosocial barriers. The paper seeks to address the inadequacy in AI-assisted persuasive dialogues for driving positive health behavior change.

Method: The study proposes a benchmark framework with virtual patient profiles and simulations of nurse-agent interactions using diverse strategies for persuasive counseling. Longitudinal and adversarial scenarios are tested to stress LLM adaptability.

Result: The findings show larger, reflective LLMs exhibit adaptability but face challenges in overcoming patient resistance, especially under social pressures, indicating limitations in current persuasive AI models.

Conclusion: There is a need for advancing LLMs to better handle behavior change under realistic conditions, and ChatCLIDS acts as a scalable testbed for refining trustworthy persuasive AI.

Abstract: Real-world adoption of closed-loop insulin delivery systems (CLIDS) in type 1
diabetes remains low, driven not by technical failure, but by diverse
behavioral, psychosocial, and social barriers. We introduce ChatCLIDS, the
first benchmark to rigorously evaluate LLM-driven persuasive dialogue for
health behavior change. Our framework features a library of expert-validated
virtual patients, each with clinically grounded, heterogeneous profiles and
realistic adoption barriers, and simulates multi-turn interactions with nurse
agents equipped with a diverse set of evidence-based persuasive strategies.
ChatCLIDS uniquely supports longitudinal counseling and adversarial social
influence scenarios, enabling robust, multi-dimensional evaluation. Our
findings reveal that while larger and more reflective LLMs adapt strategies
over time, all models struggle to overcome resistance, especially under
realistic social pressure. These results highlight critical limitations of
current LLMs for behavior change, and offer a high-fidelity, scalable testbed
for advancing trustworthy persuasive AI in healthcare and beyond.

*Shubham Gandhi,Jason Tsay,Jatin Ganhotra,Kiran Kate,Yara Rizk*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces SWE-PRM, a mechanism to detect and correct task inefficiencies of LLM agents during execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents often struggle with inefficiencies like redundant exploration in software engineering tasks. Addressing these issues only post-hoc limits their effectiveness.

Method: SWE-PRM utilizes inference-time interventions based on a taxonomy of error patterns, providing interpretable feedback to course-correct LLM agent trajectories.

Result: Closed-source PRMs increased task resolution rates from 40% to 50.6%, with notable improvements in complex tasks and reduced execution inefficiencies.

Conclusion: SWE-PRMs offer scalable and practical improvements to LLM agents in software engineering by enhancing task success rates and trajectory efficiency without altering the base model policy.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed for complex,
multi-step software engineering (SWE) tasks. However, their trajectories often
contain costly inefficiencies, such as redundant exploration, looping, and
failure to terminate once a solution is reached. Prior work has largely treated
these errors in a post-hoc manner, diagnosing failures only after execution. In
this paper, we introduce SWE-PRM, an inference-time Process Reward Model (PRM)
that intervenes during execution to detect and course-correct trajectory-level
errors. Our PRM design leverages a taxonomy of common inefficiencies and
delivers lightweight, interpretable feedback without modifying the underlying
policy. On SWE-bench Verified, closed-source PRMs improve resolution from 40.0%
to 50.6% (+10.6 p.p.), with the largest gains on medium and hard tasks. Among
feedback strategies, taxonomy-guided PRMs outperform unguided or explicit
action-prescriptive variants, increasing success rate while reducing trajectory
length. These benefits come at an acceptable added inference cost of as low as
$0.2, making PRMs a practical and scalable mechanism for improving SWE agents'
reliability and efficiency.

*Yanxiao Zhao,Yaqian Li,Zihao Bo,Rinyoichi Takezoe,Haojia Hui,Mo Guang,Lei Ren,Xiaolin Qin,Kaiwen Long*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SATQuest introduces a tool for assessing and enhancing LLMs' logical reasoning capabilities using SAT-based methodologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address shortcomings in existing methods for evaluating LLM reasoning capabilities, including issues around variability control and narrowness in problem types.

Method: Develop SATQuest, which uses CNF instances to generate diversified problems along dimensions like scale, type, and format, with evaluation and reinforcement fine-tuning.

Result: SATQuest reveals limitations in LLM reasoning in adapting beyond familiar formats and demonstrates improved performance with reinforcement fine-tuning.

Conclusion: SATQuest serves as a foundational tool to systematically evaluate and enhance logical reasoning in LLMs, offering advancements and highlighting remaining challenges.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
general reasoning capabilities. However, systematically evaluating and
enhancing these reasoning capabilities is challenging due to the lack of
controllable and scalable tools for fine-grained analysis. Existing benchmarks
and datasets often lack the necessary variable control for multi-dimensional,
systematic analysis and training, or have narrow problem types and formats. To
address these limitations, we introduce SATQuest, a systematic verifier
designed to evaluate and enhance logical reasoning in LLMs by generating
diverse, Satisfiability-based logical reasoning problems directly from
Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) instances. SATQuest structures these problems
along three orthogonal dimensions: instance scale, problem type, and question
format, employing randomized, SAT-based problem generation and objective answer
verification via PySAT. This design mitigates memorization issues, allows for
nuanced insights into reasoning performance, and enables effective
reinforcement fine-tuning. Our extensive evaluation of various LLMs using
SATQuest identified significant limitations in their logical reasoning,
particularly in generalizing beyond familiar mathematical formats. Furthermore,
we show that reinforcement fine-tuning with SATQuest rewards substantially
improves targeted task performance and generalizes to more complex instances,
while highlighting remaining challenges in cross-format adaptation. Through
these demonstrations, we showcase SATQuest's potential as a foundational tool
and a valuable starting point for advancing LLM logical reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of scale, latency, and fragmented insights in existing urban data systems, aiming to enhance urban life through advanced data processing and decision-making frameworks.

Method: Introduce a digital twin framework integrating physics-informed machine learning, semantic knowledge graphs, multimodal data fusion, and LLM-generated adaptive rule intelligence.

Result: The framework combines real-world constraints, semantic integration of heterogeneous data, and context-aware real-time filtering to improve operational efficiency and resilience under resource constraints.

Conclusion: The approach advances smart infrastructure development by enabling responsive, trustworthy, and sustainable urban systems leveraging adaptive decision-making and integrated data processing.

Abstract: Cities today generate enormous streams of data from sensors, cameras, and
connected infrastructure. While this information offers unprecedented
opportunities to improve urban life, most existing systems struggle with scale,
latency, and fragmented insights. This work introduces a framework that blends
physics-informed machine learning, multimodal data fusion, and knowledge graph
representation with adaptive, rule-based intelligence powered by large language
models (LLMs). Physics-informed methods ground learning in real-world
constraints, ensuring predictions remain meaningful and consistent with
physical dynamics. Knowledge graphs act as the semantic backbone, integrating
heterogeneous sensor data into a connected, queryable structure. At the edge,
LLMs generate context-aware rules that adapt filtering and decision-making in
real time, enabling efficient operation even under constrained resources.
Together, these elements form a foundation for digital twin systems that go
beyond passive monitoring to provide actionable insights. By uniting
physics-based reasoning, semantic data fusion, and adaptive rule generation,
this approach opens new possibilities for creating responsive, trustworthy, and
sustainable smart infrastructures.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid intelligence framework combining Learning to Rank models and agent-based systems (Need-Seed agents) for efficient patent portfolio pruning and identifying high-value assets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies and limitations of current patent valuation methods which often rely on retrospective analysis or manual processes.

Method: Utilizes a Learning to Rank model alongside Need-Seed agent-based systems. NLP and fine-tuned large language models analyze market data and patents, aligning them using a Core Ontology Framework. Incorporates dynamic parameter weighting and a Human-in-the-loop validation process.

Result: The framework automates patent valuation by identifying high potential assets that align with market needs, improving the strategy of divestment decisions.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is an innovative and automated solution for enhancing patent portfolio valuation and strategic technology transfer by integrating advanced AI and HITL elements.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel, multi stage hybrid intelligence framework for
pruning patent portfolios to identify high value assets for technology
transfer. Current patent valuation methods often rely on retrospective
indicators or manual, time intensive analysis. Our framework automates and
deepens this process by combining a Learning to Rank (LTR) model, which
evaluates patents against over 30 legal and commercial parameters, with a
unique "Need-Seed" agent-based system. The "Need Agent" uses Natural Language
Processing (NLP) to mine unstructured market and industry data, identifying
explicit technological needs. Concurrently, the "Seed Agent" employs fine tuned
Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze patent claims and map their
technological capabilities. The system generates a "Core Ontology Framework"
that matches high potential patents (Seeds) to documented market demands
(Needs), providing a strategic rationale for divestment decisions. We detail
the architecture, including a dynamic parameter weighting system and a crucial
Human in the-Loop (HITL) validation protocol, to ensure both adaptability and
real-world credibility.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces LENS, a neuro-symbolic method combining symbolic program synthesis with LLMs for automated explanations of logic programs, aimed at improving human-machine learning interactions. However, human learning experiments showed no significant performance improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance Ultra Strong Machine Learning by automating scalable explanations, allowing systems to quantifiably improve human understanding and learning.

Method: LENS uses large language models to generate natural language explanations for logic programs, replacing manual templates with automated processes. Researchers evaluated explanation quality using LLM judges, human validation, and a human learning experiment across domains.

Result: LENS produces high-quality explanations outperforming LLM prompt responses and hand-crafted templates. Yet, results indicate that extensive LLM responses do not significantly improve human learning in simpler domains.

Conclusion: While LENS lays groundwork for improving human learning via automated explanations, additional work is needed to ensure usability and effectiveness in diverse learning scenarios.

Abstract: Ultra Strong Machine Learning (USML) refers to symbolic learning systems that
not only improve their own performance but can also teach their acquired
knowledge to quantifiably improve human performance. In this work, we present
LENS (Logic Programming Explanation via Neural Summarisation), a neuro-symbolic
method that combines symbolic program synthesis with large language models
(LLMs) to automate the explanation of machine-learned logic programs in natural
language. LENS addresses a key limitation of prior USML approaches by replacing
hand-crafted explanation templates with scalable automated generation. Through
systematic evaluation using multiple LLM judges and human validation, we
demonstrate that LENS generates superior explanations compared to direct LLM
prompting and hand-crafted templates. To investigate whether LENS can teach
transferable active learning strategies, we carried out a human learning
experiment across three related domains. Our results show no significant human
performance improvements, suggesting that comprehensive LLM responses may
overwhelm users for simpler problems rather than providing learning support.
Our work provides a solid foundation for building effective USML systems to
support human learning. The source code is available on:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for new reasoning techniques in LLM performance, arguing that conventional paradigms like SFT and RLVR are reaching diminishing returns in scalability and efficiency.

Method: CoreThink utilizes General Symbolics to structure reasoning processes for tool-calling, code generation, and planning, tested across seven benchmarks without finetuning or added training costs.

Result: CoreThink achieves SOTA benchmarks like 66.66% on Livecodebench v6, 89% on Instruction-Following Evals, and 24.4% on ARC-AGI-2, alongside a coding IDE obtaining 62.3% on SWE-Bench Lite.

Conclusion: The CoreThink Reasoning Layer, based on General Symbolics, not only enhances reasoning accuracy but also does so efficiently, forming a foundation for future breakthroughs in reasoning-intensive applications.

Abstract: We introduce CoreThink, a state-of-the-art Reasoning Layer built upon a novel
reasoning method called General Symbolics. This approach diverges from
reasoning paradigms such as test-time scaling, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT),
and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). CoreThink General
Symbolic Reasoner (GSR) is specifically structured around three key use cases:
tool-calling, code generation, and planning, demonstrating exemplary
performance across a total of seven benchmarks in their respective areas.
Notably, we are achieving SOTA scores of 66.66\% on Livecodebench v6, 89\% on
Instruction-Following Evals, and 24.4\% on ARC-AGI-2. We also present an
agentic coding IDE, developed using the principles of General Symbolics, which
achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 62.3\% on \texttt{SWE-Bench Lite}. We
are able to achieve these improvements without any finetuning or training
costs. Our Reasoning Layer is designed to provide a pure performance uplift,
ensuring that a model's accuracy on reasoning tasks is never negatively
impacted. We argue that incumbent methods will eventually lead to diminishing
returns in LLM performance, necessitating the development of new reasoning
techniques. This technical report details our approach at a high level and the
availability of the CoreThink models for reasoning-intensive use cases.

TL;DR: ReaL-TG is a reinforcement learning framework designed to fine-tune large language models (LLMs) for explainable link forecasting on temporal graphs (TGs), focusing on reasoning strategies and evaluation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional neural approaches for temporal graph reasoning lack explainability and adaptability on unseen graphs, and existing LLM approaches are mostly confined to static or synthetic environments with insufficient reasoning trace assessments.

Method: ReaL-TG fine-tunes LLMs using an outcome-based reward system to encourage reasoning from graph structures while producing explanatory traces. It introduces a new evaluation protocol that combines ranking metrics with an LLM-as-a-Judge system to assess reasoning quality and hallucination impact.

Result: ReaL-TG-4B, a fine-tuned version of Qwen3-4B, outperformed larger LLMs (e.g., GPT-5 mini) in ranking metrics and generated high-quality explanations as validated by LLM and human judges.

Conclusion: ReaL-TG demonstrates the potential of reinforcement learning to refine LLMs for reasoning tasks, achieving strong link forecasting performance while maintaining transparency and producing reliable explanatory traces.

Abstract: Forecasting future links is a central task in temporal graph (TG) reasoning,
requiring models to leverage historical interactions to predict upcoming ones.
Traditional neural approaches, such as temporal graph neural networks, achieve
strong performance but lack explainability and cannot be applied to unseen
graphs without retraining. Recent studies have begun to explore using large
language models (LLMs) for graph reasoning, but most of them are constrained to
static graphs or small synthetic TGs and lack the evaluation of the quality of
reasoning traces generated by LLMs. In this work, we present Reasoning-Enhanced
Learning for Temporal Graphs (ReaL-TG), a reinforcement learning framework that
fine-tunes LLMs to perform explainable link forecasting on real-world TGs.
ReaL-TG uses outcome-based reward to encourage models to self-explore reasoning
strategies from graph structure and to produce explanations that directly
justify their predictions. To enable evaluation on LLM-generated reasoning
traces, we propose a new evaluation protocol combining ranking metrics with an
LLM-as-a-Judge system that assesses both the quality of reasoning and the
impact of hallucinations. Experiments with ReaL-TG-4B, obtained by fine-tuning
Qwen3-4B under our framework, show that it outperforms much larger frontier
LLMs, including GPT-5 mini, on ranking metrics, while producing high-quality
explanations confirmed by both the LLM judge and human evaluation.

Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) face challenges in complex causal reasoning and discovery due to issues like hallucination and difficulty in handling specialized relationships, necessitating advancement through multi-agent approaches.

Method: The paper examines design patterns such as pipeline processing, debate frameworks, simulation environments, and iterative loops for causal reasoning tasks managed by multi-agent LLM systems.

Result: Multi-agent LLM systems demonstrate applications in domains like scientific discovery, healthcare, and fact-checking, offering improved handling of causal analyses.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes the current limitations of causal multi-agent LLMs and outlines future research directions, aiming to improve their efficiency and domain-specific application.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
various reasoning and generation tasks. However, their proficiency in complex
causal reasoning, discovery, and estimation remains an area of active
development, often hindered by issues like hallucination, reliance on spurious
correlations, and difficulties in handling nuanced, domain-specific, or
personalized causal relationships. Multi-agent systems, leveraging the
collaborative or specialized abilities of multiple LLM-based agents, are
emerging as a powerful paradigm to address these limitations. This review paper
explores the burgeoning field of causal multi-agent LLMs. We examine how these
systems are designed to tackle different facets of causality, including causal
reasoning and counterfactual analysis, causal discovery from data, and the
estimation of causal effects. We delve into the diverse architectural patterns
and interaction protocols employed, from pipeline-based processing and debate
frameworks to simulation environments and iterative refinement loops.
Furthermore, we discuss the evaluation methodologies, benchmarks, and diverse
application domains where causal multi-agent LLMs are making an impact,
including scientific discovery, healthcare, fact-checking, and personalized
systems. Finally, we highlight the persistent challenges, open research
questions, and promising future directions in this synergistic field, aiming to

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper identifies 'agentic speculation' as a high-throughput process LLM agents use to manipulate and analyze data, highlighting inefficiencies for modern data systems and proposing an "agent-first" architecture to address them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern data systems are not optimized to handle the inefficiencies and challenges caused by the high-throughput, speculative data manipulation of LLM agents.

Method: The authors analyzed the characteristics of 'agentic speculation' (e.g., scale, heterogeneity, redundancy, steerability) and proposed research opportunities for developing data systems architectures tailored to agentic workloads.

Result: The paper provides a framework for addressing inefficiencies by suggesting new query interfaces, query processing methods, and memory stores that align with agentic workflows.

Conclusion: The inefficiencies inherent in agentic workloads necessitate rethinking data system architectures to support the emerging dominance of LLM agents.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents, acting on their users' behalf to
manipulate and analyze data, are likely to become the dominant workload for
data systems in the future. When working with data, agents employ a
high-throughput process of exploration and solution formulation for the given
task, one we call agentic speculation. The sheer volume and inefficiencies of
agentic speculation can pose challenges for present-day data systems. We argue
that data systems need to adapt to more natively support agentic workloads. We
take advantage of the characteristics of agentic speculation that we identify,
i.e., scale, heterogeneity, redundancy, and steerability - to outline a number
of new research opportunities for a new agent-first data systems architecture,
ranging from new query interfaces, to new query processing techniques, to new
agentic memory stores.

*Yukio-Pegio Gunji,Andrew Adamatzky,Panagiotis Mougkogiannis,Andrei Khrenikov*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores open computing within chemical reactions to bridge Artificial Intelligence and Natural-born Intelligence and proposes Token and Type computing for adaptive systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To differentiate Artificial and Natural-born Intelligence computational processes and create adaptive systems leveraging chemical reactions.

Method: Defines open computing based on chemical reactions, implementing Token computing (individual molecule behavior) and Type computing (normative behavior), examining their interplay.

Result: Adaptive chemical reactions, transitioning clustering dynamics, self-organizing critical phenomena, and quantum coherence enabling spike wave transmission.

Conclusion: Open computing bridges artificial and natural intelligence through chemical reactions, showcasing interplay between Token and Type computing with quantum-like coherence.

Abstract: By uncovering the contrast between Artificial Intelligence and Natural-born
Intelligence as a computational process, we define closed computing and open
computing, and implement open computing within chemical reactions. This
involves forming a mixture and invalidation of the computational process and
the execution environment, which are logically distinct, and coalescing both to
create a system that adjusts fluctuations. We model chemical reactions by
considering the computation as the chemical reaction and the execution
environment as the degree of aggregation of molecules that interact with the
reactive environment. This results in a chemical reaction that progresses while
repeatedly clustering and de-clustering, where concentration no longer holds
significant meaning. Open computing is segmented into Token computing, which
focuses on the individual behavior of chemical molecules, and Type computing,
which focuses on normative behavior. Ultimately, both are constructed as an
interplay between the two. In this system, Token computing demonstrates
self-organizing critical phenomena, while Type computing exhibits quantum
logic. Through their interplay, the recruitment of fluctuations is realized,
giving rise to interactions between quantum logical subspaces corresponding to
quantum coherence across different Hilbert spaces. As a result, spike waves are
formed, enabling signal transmission. This occurrence may be termed
quantum-like coherence, implying the source of enzymes responsible for
controlling spike waves and biochemical rhythms.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Block Rearrangement Problem (BRaP) and develops five search-based algorithms for planning rearrangements in dense warehouse grids.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address an important and challenging issue in warehouse management where storage blocks need efficient rearrangement in large dense grids.

Method: Five search-based algorithms are proposed, drawing insights from sliding puzzles, and leveraging techniques such as joint configuration space, classical planning, multi-agent pathfinding, and expert heuristics.

Result: The methods show scalability and efficiency, successfully solving plans for deeply buried blocks within grid sizes up to 80x80, despite the exponential complexity.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithms are effective and scalable solutions to the BRaP, proving their utility in warehouse management applications.

Abstract: We introduce the Block Rearrangement Problem (BRaP), a challenging component
of large warehouse management which involves rearranging storage blocks within
dense grids to achieve a target state. We formally define the BRaP as a graph
search problem. Building on intuitions from sliding puzzle problems, we propose
five search-based solution algorithms, leveraging joint configuration space
search, classical planning, multi-agent pathfinding, and expert heuristics. We
evaluate the five approaches empirically for plan quality and scalability.
Despite the exponential relation between search space size and block number,
our methods demonstrate efficiency in creating rearrangement plans for deeply
buried blocks in up to 80x80 grids.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents FlashAdventure, a set of 34 adventure games to benchmark long-term story completion in GUI agents. It also introduces COAST, an agent framework to address memory-related challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate and enhance the capabilities of GUI agents in fully completing complex, narrative-driven tasks by addressing the observation-behavior gap.

Method: Developed FlashAdventure for benchmarking and COAST, a framework with long-term memory for improved planning. They also proposed CUA-as-a-Judge for automated performance evaluations.

Result: COAST outperformed existing agents in milestone completion by addressing memory challenges. However, there’s still a large performance gap between agents and humans.

Conclusion: GUI agents need significant improvement to handle long-term, narrative-driven interactions, as shown by the superior performance of humans compared to agents.

Abstract: GUI agents powered by LLMs show promise in interacting with diverse digital
environments. Among these, video games offer a valuable testbed due to their
varied interfaces, with adventure games posing additional challenges through
complex, narrative-driven interactions. Existing game benchmarks, however, lack
diversity and rarely evaluate agents on completing entire storylines. To
address this, we introduce FlashAdventure, a benchmark of 34 Flash-based
adventure games designed to test full story arc completion and tackle the
observation-behavior gap: the challenge of remembering and acting on earlier
gameplay information. We also propose CUA-as-a-Judge, an automated gameplay
evaluator, and COAST, an agentic framework leveraging long-term clue memory to
better plan and solve sequential tasks. Experiments show current GUI agents
struggle with full story arcs, while COAST improves milestone completion by
bridging the observation-behavior gap. Nonetheless, a marked discrepancy
between humans and best-performing agents warrants continued research efforts
to narrow this divide.

*Dongfu Jiang,Yi Lu,Zhuofeng Li,Zhiheng Lyu,Ping Nie,Haozhe Wang,Alex Su,Hui Chen,Kai Zou,Chao Du,Tianyu Pang,Wenhu Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces VerlTool, a unified modular framework for tool-augmented reinforcement learning that eliminates inefficiencies of existing systems and supports multi-turn and multi-modal interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing frameworks for multi-turn tool interaction in reinforcement learning suffer from fragmentation, execution inefficiencies, and limited scalability, hampering broader adoption and innovation.

Method: The authors designed VerlTool using systematic modular principles, integrating standardized APIs for tool management, asynchronous rollout execution for improved speed, and a unified training infrastructure for diverse tasks.

Result: VerlTool demonstrated competitive performance across six ARLT domains, achieved near 2x speed improvements, and provided extensibility via modular plugin architecture.

Conclusion: VerlTool offers a scalable, efficient, and unified framework for multi-turn and tool-augmented reinforcement learning, facilitating broader research and development while outperforming domain-specific systems.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated
success in enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities, but remains limited to
single-turn interactions without tool integration. While recent Agentic
Reinforcement Learning with Tool use (ARLT) approaches have emerged to address
multi-turn tool interactions, existing works develop task-specific codebases
that suffer from fragmentation, synchronous execution bottlenecks, and limited
extensibility across domains. These inefficiencies hinder broader community
adoption and algorithmic innovation. We introduce VerlTool, a unified and
modular framework that addresses these limitations through systematic design
principles. VerlTool provides four key contributions: (1) upstream alignment
with VeRL ensuring compatibility and simplified maintenance, (2) unified tool
management via standardized APIs supporting diverse modalities including code
execution, search, SQL databases, and vision processing, (3) asynchronous
rollout execution achieving near 2$\times$ speedup by eliminating
synchronization bottlenecks, and (4) comprehensive evaluation demonstrating
competitive performance across 6 ARLT domains. Our framework formalizes ARLT as
multi-turn trajectories with multi-modal observation tokens (text/image/video),
extending beyond single-turn RLVR paradigms. We train and evaluate models on
mathematical reasoning, knowledge QA, SQL generation, visual reasoning, web
search, and software engineering tasks, achieving results comparable to
specialized systems while providing unified training infrastructure. The
modular plugin architecture enables rapid tool integration requiring only
lightweight Python definitions, significantly reducing development overhead and
providing a scalable foundation for tool-augmented RL research. Our code is
open-sourced at https://github.com/TIGER-AI-Lab/verl-tool.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Robix is an integrated vision-language system for robots, enabling reasoning, task planning, and natural language interactions for robust, end-to-end performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified model that improves robotic task planning, reasoning, and natural communication with humans, addressing challenges like handling complex instructions and interruptions during tasks.

Method: Robix employs a three-stage training approach: continued pretraining for embodied reasoning, supervised finetuning for integrating reasoning and actions, and reinforcement learning for coherence and consistency.

Result: Experiments show Robix outperforms existing baselines in interactive task execution across diverse instructions and real-world tasks such as grocery shopping and dietary filtering.

Conclusion: Robix enhances robotic cognitive layers to perform long-horizon tasks and human interaction capably, achieving state-of-the-art generalization in robotic systems.

Abstract: We introduce Robix, a unified model that integrates robot reasoning, task
planning, and natural language interaction within a single vision-language
architecture. Acting as the high-level cognitive layer in a hierarchical robot
system, Robix dynamically generates atomic commands for the low-level
controller and verbal responses for human interaction, enabling robots to
follow complex instructions, plan long-horizon tasks, and interact naturally
with human within an end-to-end framework. Robix further introduces novel
capabilities such as proactive dialogue, real-time interruption handling, and
context-aware commonsense reasoning during task execution. At its core, Robix
leverages chain-of-thought reasoning and adopts a three-stage training
strategy: (1) continued pretraining to enhance foundational embodied reasoning
abilities including 3D spatial understanding, visual grounding, and
task-centric reasoning; (2) supervised finetuning to model human-robot
interaction and task planning as a unified reasoning-action sequence; and (3)
reinforcement learning to improve reasoning-action consistency and long-horizon
task coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Robix outperforms both
open-source and commercial baselines (e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Pro) in
interactive task execution, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse
instruction types (e.g., open-ended, multi-stage, constrained, invalid, and
interrupted) and various user-involved tasks such as table bussing, grocery
shopping, and dietary filtering.

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of causal abstractive simulation to study how language models simulate processes like a fair coin toss, addressing both failures and successes of such simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To connect language model simulation practices with a formal causality framework, providing insights into both practical applications and philosophical interpretations.

Method: The method centers on using causal abstractive simulation principles to simulate a fair coin toss with language models, analyzing both failure and success cases for validation.

Result: The paper demonstrates how language models can either fail or succeed in simulating certain systems when evaluated using a formal causal framework.

Conclusion: Causal abstractive simulation offers valuable tools for practitioners, philosophers, and mathematicians to better understand the mechanisms and implications of language model simulations.

Abstract: This note illustrates how a variety of causal abstraction arXiv:1707.00819
arXiv:1812.03789, defined here as causal abstractive simulation, can be used to
formalize a simple example of language model simulation. This note considers
the case of simulating a fair coin toss with a language model. Examples are
presented illustrating the ways language models can fail to simulate, and a
success case is presented, illustrating how this formalism may be used to prove
that a language model simulates some other system, given a causal description
of the system. This note may be of interest to three groups. For practitioners
in the growing field of language model simulation, causal abstractive
simulation is a means to connect ad-hoc statistical benchmarking practices to
the solid formal foundation of causality. Philosophers of AI and philosophers
of mind may be interested as causal abstractive simulation gives a precise
operationalization to the idea that language models are role-playing
arXiv:2402.12422. Mathematicians and others working on causal abstraction may
be interested to see a new application of the core ideas that yields a new
variation of causal abstraction.

*Wonduk Seo,Taesub Shin,Hyunjin An,Dokyun Kim,Seunghyun Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Q2K, a framework using large language models and multi-agent reasoning to reliably map SKUs in e-commerce, surpassing traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mapping inconsistent product listings (SKUs) across platforms has challenges due to varying names and missing explicit identifiers.

Method: Q2K utilizes reasoning agents for disambiguation questions, knowledge agents for focused web searches, deduplication agents for consistency, and human involvement to refine uncertain cases.

Result: Q2K performs better than existing baseline methods in SKU mapping accuracy and robustness, especially in challenging aspects like brand origin disambiguation.

Conclusion: Q2K offers a scalable, efficient, and interpretable solution that improves SKU mapping accuracy while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Identifying whether two product listings refer to the same Stock Keeping Unit
(SKU) is a persistent challenge in ecommerce, especially when explicit
identifiers are missing and product names vary widely across platforms. Rule
based heuristics and keyword similarity often misclassify products by
overlooking subtle distinctions in brand, specification, or bundle
configuration. To overcome these limitations, we propose Question to Knowledge
(Q2K), a multi agent framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for
reliable SKU mapping. Q2K integrates: (1) a Reasoning Agent that generates
targeted disambiguation questions, (2) a Knowledge Agent that resolves them via
focused web searches, and (3) a Deduplication Agent that reuses validated
reasoning traces to reduce redundancy and ensure consistency. A human in the
loop mechanism further refines uncertain cases. Experiments on real world
consumer goods datasets show that Q2K surpasses strong baselines, achieving
higher accuracy and robustness in difficult scenarios such as bundle
identification and brand origin disambiguation. By reusing retrieved reasoning
instead of issuing repeated searches, Q2K balances accuracy with efficiency,
offering a scalable and interpretable solution for product integration.

### [51] [Towards Open-World Retrieval-Augmented Generation on Knowledge Graph: A Multi-Agent Collaboration Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01238)
*Jiasheng Xu,Mingda Li,Yongqiang Tang,Peijie Wang,Wensheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AnchorRAG introduces a multi-agent collaboration framework for retrieval-augmented generation using knowledge graphs without relying on predefined anchor entities, improving robustness and accuracy in open-world question answering tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitation of existing KG-based retrieval-augmented generation approaches, which rely on predefined anchor entities and often face challenges in open-world settings where accurate query-entity linking is unreliable.

Method: The authors propose AnchorRAG, which employs a multi-agent framework. A predictor agent dynamically identifies candidate anchor entities, retriever agents perform parallel multi-hop explorations, and a supervisor agent manages the retrieval strategy and synthesizes the final knowledge paths.

Result: Empirical evaluations on four public benchmarks show that AnchorRAG achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing baselines in real-world question answering tasks.

Conclusion: AnchorRAG enhances retrieval robustness and resolves issues related to inaccurate or ambiguous anchors in open-world RAG settings, offering a more effective solution for integrating knowledge graphs into large language models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
language understanding and reasoning. However, their dependence on static
training corpora makes them prone to factual errors and knowledge gaps.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this limitation by incorporating
external knowledge sources, especially structured Knowledge Graphs (KGs), which
provide explicit semantics and efficient retrieval. Existing KG-based RAG
approaches, however, generally assume that anchor entities are accessible to
initiate graph traversal, which limits their robustness in open world settings
where accurate linking between the query and the entity is unreliable. To
overcome this limitation, we propose AnchorRAG, a novel multi-agent
collaboration framework for open-world RAG without the predefined anchor
entities. Specifically, a predictor agent dynamically identifies candidate
anchor entities by aligning user query terms with KG nodes and initializes
independent retriever agents to conduct parallel multi-hop explorations from
each candidate. Then a supervisor agent formulates the iterative retrieval
strategy for these retriever agents and synthesizes the resulting knowledge
paths to generate the final answer. This multi-agent collaboration framework
improves retrieval robustness and mitigates the impact of ambiguous or
erroneous anchors. Extensive experiments on four public benchmarks demonstrate
that AnchorRAG significantly outperforms existing baselines and establishes new
state-of-the-art results on the real-world question answering tasks.

*Yusheng Zheng,Yanpeng Hu,Wei Zhang,Andi Quinn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SchedCP introduces a framework for Large Language Model (LLM) agents to autonomously optimize Linux schedulers by bridging the semantic gap between kernel policies and application-specific needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Operating system schedulers often lack the ability to understand application-specific requirements due to a semantic gap, leading to inefficient performance.

Method: SchedCP employs a decoupled control plane to separate semantic reasoning (AI's role) from execution (system's role). It includes three main components: Workload Analysis Engine, Scheduler Policy Repository, and Execution Verifier to analyze workloads, generate policies, and validate them before deployment.

Result: SchedCP improves performance by up to 1.79x and reduces costs by 13x compared to naive approaches, with a high success rate of deployment.

Conclusion: SchedCP enables autonomous system optimization, democratizing expert-level scheduler management and moving towards self-optimizing operating systems with open-source implementation.

Abstract: Operating system schedulers suffer from a fundamental semantic gap, where
kernel policies fail to understand application-specific needs, leading to
suboptimal performance. We introduce SchedCP, the first framework that enables
fully autonomous Large Language Model (LLM) agents to safely and efficiently
optimize Linux schedulers without human involvement. Our core insight is that
the challenge is not merely to apply a better LLM, but to architect a decoupled
control plane that separates the AI's role of semantic reasoning ("what to
optimize") from the system's role of execution ("how to observe and act").
Implemented as Model Context Protocol(MCP) server, SchedCP provides a stable
interface with three key services: a Workload Analysis Engine, an evolving
Scheduler Policy Repository, and an Execution Verifier that validates all
AI-generated code and configure before deployment with static and dynamic
analysis.
  We demonstrate this architecture's power with sched-agent, a multi-agent
system that autonomously analyzes workloads, synthesizes custom eBPF scheduling
policies, and deploys them via the sched\_ext infrastructure. Our evaluation
shows that SchedCP achieves up to an 1.79x performance improvement, and a 13x
cost reduction compared to naive agentic approaches, all while maintaining high
success rate. By bridging the semantic gap, SchedCP democratizes expert-level
system optimization and represents a step towards creating truly
self-optimizing, application-aware operating systems. The code is open-sourced

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces VGTeam, a cost-efficient slide show video generation system powered by large language models, consisting of communicative agents specializing in different video creation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional text-to-video models face high computational costs, limiting accessibility and scalability.

Method: VGTeam uses a chat tower workflow where communicative agents collaboratively handle tasks such as scriptwriting, scene creation, and audio design based on textual prompts.

Result: The system achieves a video generation cost of $0.103 and a high success rate of 98.4%, while maintaining creative fidelity and customization.

Conclusion: VGTeam democratizes video creation by making it accessible and efficient, showcasing the transformative potential of applying language models to creative domains.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), the proliferation
of AI-generated content (AIGC) tasks has significantly accelerated developments
in text-to-video generation. As a result, the field of video production is
undergoing a transformative shift. However, conventional text-to-video models
are typically constrained by high computational costs.
  In this study, we propose Video-Generation-Team (VGTeam), a novel slide show
video generation system designed to redefine the video creation pipeline
through the integration of large language models (LLMs). VGTeam is composed of
a suite of communicative agents, each responsible for a distinct aspect of
video generation, such as scriptwriting, scene creation, and audio design.
These agents operate collaboratively within a chat tower workflow, transforming
user-provided textual prompts into coherent, slide-style narrative videos.
  By emulating the sequential stages of traditional video production, VGTeam
achieves remarkable improvements in both efficiency and scalability, while
substantially reducing computational overhead. On average, the system generates
videos at a cost of only $0.103, with a successful generation rate of 98.4%.
Importantly, this framework maintains a high degree of creative fidelity and
customization.
  The implications of VGTeam are far-reaching. It democratizes video production
by enabling broader access to high-quality content creation without the need
for extensive resources. Furthermore, it highlights the transformative
potential of language models in creative domains and positions VGTeam as a
pioneering system for next-generation content creation.

*Mattia Tritto,Giuseppe Farano,Dario Di Palma,Gaetano Rossiello,Fedelucio Narducci,Dharmashankar Subramanian,Tommaso Di Noia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) to improve Text-to-SQL accuracy and compares them against existing methods like Best-of-N (BoN) and Majority Voting (Maj). ORMs demonstrate superior performance in aligning SQL generation with user intent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have enhanced the generation of SQL queries from natural language, but still face challenges with complex queries requiring alignment between user intent and database schema. Current methods rely on heuristics that are not robust for complex query generation, motivating exploration of semantically driven strategies like ORMs.

Method: The study evaluates ORMs as a heuristic for BoN and introduces a framework to train ORMs tailored for Text-to-SQL tasks. ORMs are tested on BIRD and SPIDER benchmarks, using finetuned open-source LLMs including Qwen2, Granite3, and Llama3.

Result: ORMs achieved execution accuracy gains of +4.33% (BIRD) and +2.10% (Spider) over ex-BoN, and +2.91% (BIRD) and +0.93% (Spider) over Maj, showcasing their effectiveness. Finetuning of SQL-aligned models like OmniSQL further improved ORM performance.

Conclusion: Outcome Reward Models yield better alignment of SQL queries with user intent compared to traditional heuristics. They are especially beneficial with an increased number of candidates and are effective for both simple and complex queries.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL, the task of translating natural language questions into SQL
queries, has significantly advanced with the introduction of Large Language
Models (LLMs), broadening database accessibility for a wide range of users.
Despite substantial progress in generating valid SQL, current LLMs still
struggle with complex queries that require precise alignment between user
intent and the database schema. To mitigate this, test-time strategies such as
Best-of-N (BoN) and Majority Voting (Maj) are often employed, based on the
assumption that LLMs can generate correct answers but may require multiple
attempts. However, these methods rely on surface-level heuristics, selecting
either the syntactically correct query through execution-based BoN (ex-BoN) or
the most frequently generated query with Maj. Recently, Outcome Reward Models
(ORMs), which assign utility scores to generated outputs based on semantic
correctness, have emerged as a promising approach for better aligning model
predictions with user intent. Nevertheless, their application to Text-to-SQL
remains largely underexplored.
  In this work, we evaluate ORMs as an effective heuristic for BoN, compare
them with ex-BoN and Maj, and introduce a framework for training ORMs for the
Text-to-SQL task. We evaluate our ORMs on the BIRD and SPIDER benchmarks,
finetuning various open-source LLMs, including the Qwen2, Granite3, and Llama3
model families. Our results show that ORMs outperform ex-BoN and Maj, achieving
execution accuracy gains of +4.33% (BIRD) and +2.10% (Spider) over ex-BoN, and
+2.91% (BIRD) and +0.93% (Spider) over Maj. We further demonstrate that
finetuning models already aligned with SQL generation, such as OmniSQL, yields
superior ORM performance. Additionally, we observe that ORMs achieve
competitive results on simple queries and benefit more from an increased number
of candidates compared to ex-BoN and Maj.

*Francesca Cairoli,Luca Bortolussi,Jyotirmoy V. Deshmukh,Lars Lindemann,Nicola Paoletti*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study introduces GenQPM, a deep generative model-based method for predicting the satisfaction levels of temporal logic properties in stochastic systems while considering multi-modal dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing QPM methods fail to provide meaningful mode-specific predictions when monitoring systems with multi-modal dynamics, leading to overly conservative and uninformative intervals.

Method: GenQPM utilizes score-based diffusion models to approximate probabilistic, multi-modal dynamics, combined with a mode classifier to partition system behaviors and conformal inference to generate statistically valid, mode-specific prediction intervals.

Result: Experiments on agent navigation and autonomous driving tasks show that GenQPM provides significantly less conservative and more informative prediction intervals compared to mode-agnostic baselines.

Conclusion: GenQPM offers an advanced and computationally efficient solution to QPM in multi-modal stochastic systems by improving prediction accuracy and overcoming mode-agnostic limitations.

Abstract: We consider the problem of quantitative predictive monitoring (QPM) of
stochastic systems, i.e., predicting at runtime the degree of satisfaction of a
desired temporal logic property from the current state of the system. Since
computational efficiency is key to enable timely intervention against predicted
violations, several state-of-the-art QPM approaches rely on fast
machine-learning surrogates to provide prediction intervals for the
satisfaction values, using conformal inference to offer statistical guarantees.
However, these QPM methods suffer when the monitored agent exhibits multi-modal
dynamics, whereby certain modes may yield high satisfaction values while others
critically violate the property. Existing QPM methods are mode-agnostic and so
would yield overly conservative and uninformative intervals that lack
meaningful mode-specific satisfaction information. To address this problem, we
present GenQPM, a method that leverages deep generative models, specifically
score-based diffusion models, to reliably approximate the probabilistic and
multi-modal system dynamics without requiring explicit model access. GenQPM
employs a mode classifier to partition the predicted trajectories by dynamical
mode. For each mode, we then apply conformal inference to produce statistically
valid, mode-specific prediction intervals. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
GenQPM on a benchmark of agent navigation and autonomous driving tasks,
resulting in prediction intervals that are significantly more informative (less
conservative) than mode-agnostic baselines.

### [56] [Error Notebook-Guided, Training-Free Part Retrieval in 3D CAD Assemblies via Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01350)
*Yunqing Liu,Nan Zhang,Zhiming Tan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework for part retrieval in CAD assemblies using Error Notebooks and RAG for improved inference without extra training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The difficulty of part retrieval in complex CAD assemblies arises from challenges like input sequence length, unsatisfactory performance of LLMs/VLMs, and lack of fine-tuning access to proprietary models.

Method: The approach leverages Error Notebooks and RAG. Error Notebooks collect incorrect reasoning (CoTs) and corrections, while RAG integrates records to enhance inference without additional training.

Result: Substantial performance gains were achieved, with a notable 23.4% improvement in absolute accuracy on a human preference dataset using GPT-4o. CoT reasoning proved beneficial, particularly for cases with over 10 parts.

Conclusion: The proposed framework improves CAD part retrieval effectively with no extra training, demonstrating engineering value in handling 3D models with complex metadata.

Abstract: Effective specification-aware part retrieval within complex CAD assemblies is
essential for automated design verification and downstream engineering tasks.
However, directly using LLMs/VLMs to this task presents some challenges: the
input sequences may exceed model token limits, and even after processing,
performance remains unsatisfactory. Moreover, fine-tuning LLMs/VLMs requires
significant computational resources, and for many high-performing general-use
proprietary models (e.g., GPT or Gemini), fine-tuning access is not available.
In this paper, we propose a novel part retrieval framework that requires no
extra training, but using Error Notebooks + RAG for refined prompt engineering
to help improve the existing general model's retrieval performance. The
construction of Error Notebooks consists of two steps: (1) collecting
historical erroneous CoTs and their incorrect answers, and (2) connecting these
CoTs through reflective corrections until the correct solutions are obtained.
As a result, the Error Notebooks serve as a repository of tasks along with
their corrected CoTs and final answers. RAG is then employed to retrieve
specification-relevant records from the Error Notebooks and incorporate them
into the inference process. Another major contribution of our work is a
human-in-the-loop CAD dataset, which is used to evaluate our method. In
addition, the engineering value of our novel framework lies in its ability to
effectively handle 3D models with lengthy, non-natural language metadata.
Experiments with proprietary models, including GPT-4o and the Gemini series,
show substantial gains, with GPT-4o (Omni) achieving up to a 23.4% absolute
accuracy improvement on the human preference dataset. Moreover, ablation
studies confirm that CoT reasoning provides benefits especially in challenging
cases with higher part counts (>10).

### [57] [DeepResearch Arena: The First Exam of LLMs' Research Abilities via Seminar-Grounded Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01396)
*Haiyuan Wan,Chen Yang,Junchi Yu,Meiqi Tu,Jiaxuan Lu,Di Yu,Jianbao Cao,Ben Gao,Jiaqing Xie,Aoran Wang,Wenlong Zhang,Philip Torr,Dongzhan Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces DeepResearch Arena, a benchmark derived from academic seminars, to evaluate research agents' performance in a realistic and challenging setup by leveraging a new automated task generation system called MAHTG.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is the difficulty in faithfully evaluating deep research agents due to the lack of authentic, frontier research questions that capture researchers' intellectual curiosity and avoid data leakage.

Method: The authors propose a Multi-Agent Hierarchical Task Generation (MAHTG) system to extract meaningful research ideas from seminar transcripts and translate them into high-quality research tasks. They use MAHTG to develop the DeepResearch Arena benchmark consisting of 10,000 tasks across 200 seminars in 12 disciplines.

Result: The developed benchmark, DeepResearch Arena, demonstrates that existing state-of-the-art research agents struggle significantly, showcasing a noticeable performance gap and highlighting the challenging nature of the benchmark.

Conclusion: DeepResearch Arena provides a robust and realistic evaluation framework for research agents and underscores the limitations of current models, pushing the need for continued advancement in this field.

Abstract: Deep research agents have attracted growing attention for their potential to
orchestrate multi-stage research workflows, spanning literature synthesis,
methodological design, and empirical verification. Despite these strides,
evaluating their research capability faithfully is rather challenging due to
the difficulty of collecting frontier research questions that genuinely capture
researchers' attention and intellectual curiosity. To address this gap, we
introduce DeepResearch Arena, a benchmark grounded in academic seminars that
capture rich expert discourse and interaction, better reflecting real-world
research environments and reducing the risk of data leakage. To automatically
construct DeepResearch Arena, we propose a Multi-Agent Hierarchical Task
Generation (MAHTG) system that extracts research-worthy inspirations from
seminar transcripts. The MAHTG system further translates research-worthy
inspirations into high-quality research tasks, ensuring the traceability of
research task formulation while filtering noise. With the MAHTG system, we
curate DeepResearch Arena with over 10,000 high-quality research tasks from
over 200 academic seminars, spanning 12 disciplines, such as literature,
history, and science. Our extensive evaluation shows that DeepResearch Arena
presents substantial challenges for current state-of-the-art agents, with clear
performance gaps observed across different models.

### [58] [The Need for Verification in AI-Driven Scientific Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01398)
*Cristina Cornelio,Takuya Ito,Ryan Cory-Wright,Sanjeeb Dash,Lior Horesh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI, particularly machine learning and large language models (LLMs), is revolutionizing science by generating hypotheses quickly but requires robust verification to avoid hindering progress.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI enables the rapid generation of scientific hypotheses, offering a chance to accelerate discovery across multiple domains while presenting challenges in ensuring the validity of these hypotheses.

Method: The study traces the historical evolution of scientific discovery, explores how AI is altering traditional methods, and reviews diverse AI frameworks including data-driven models, neural architectures, symbolic reasoning, and LLM agents.

Result: AI systems can identify patterns and generate candidate scientific laws but require stringent verification to establish scientific value.

Conclusion: Effective verification must be central to AI-powered scientific discovery to ensure reliability and progress.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the practice of science. Machine
learning and large language models (LLMs) can generate hypotheses at a scale
and speed far exceeding traditional methods, offering the potential to
accelerate discovery across diverse fields. However, the abundance of
hypotheses introduces a critical challenge: without scalable and reliable
mechanisms for verification, scientific progress risks being hindered rather
than being advanced. In this article, we trace the historical development of
scientific discovery, examine how AI is reshaping established practices for
scientific discovery, and review the principal approaches, ranging from
data-driven methods and knowledge-aware neural architectures to symbolic
reasoning frameworks and LLM agents. While these systems can uncover patterns
and propose candidate laws, their scientific value ultimately depends on
rigorous and transparent verification, which we argue must be the cornerstone
of AI-assisted discovery.

### [59] [LLM-empowered Agents Simulation Framework for Scenario Generation in Service Ecosystem Governance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01441)
*Deyu Zhou,Yuqi Hou,Xiao Xue,Xudong Lu,Qingzhong Li,Lizhen Cui*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel scenario generator design method using Large Language Models (LLMs) improves experimental system construction for service ecosystem governance by generating accurate and efficient social and uncertain scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The governance of service ecosystems is challenging due to their complex social environments, rapidly changing factors, and difficulty in measuring social elements.

Method: Three LLM-powered agents—Environment Agent (EA), Social Agent (SA), and Planner Agent (PA)—coordinate to adaptively generate social and environmental scenarios for experimental systems.

Result: Experiments on the ProgrammableWeb dataset demonstrate the method's ability to generate more accurate and efficient scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances scenario generation, offering a practical approach for service ecosystem governance and experimental system development.

Abstract: As the social environment is growing more complex and collaboration is
deepening, factors affecting the healthy development of service ecosystem are
constantly changing and diverse, making its governance a crucial research
issue. Applying the scenario analysis method and conducting scenario rehearsals
by constructing an experimental system before managers make decisions, losses
caused by wrong decisions can be largely avoided. However, it relies on
predefined rules to construct scenarios and faces challenges such as limited
information, a large number of influencing factors, and the difficulty of
measuring social elements. These challenges limit the quality and efficiency of
generating social and uncertain scenarios for the service ecosystem. Therefore,
we propose a scenario generator design method, which adaptively coordinates
three Large Language Model (LLM) empowered agents that autonomously optimize
experimental schemes to construct an experimental system and generate high
quality scenarios. Specifically, the Environment Agent (EA) generates social
environment including extremes, the Social Agent (SA) generates social
collaboration structure, and the Planner Agent (PA) couples task-role
relationships and plans task solutions. These agents work in coordination, with
the PA adjusting the experimental scheme in real time by perceiving the states
of each agent and these generating scenarios. Experiments on the
ProgrammableWeb dataset illustrate our method generates more accurate scenarios
more efficiently, and innovatively provides an effective way for service
ecosystem governance related experimental system construction.

### [60] [Counterfactual Sensitivity for Faithful Reasoning in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01544)
*Ibne Farabi Shihab,Sanjeda Akter,Anuj Sharma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Counterfactual Sensitivity Regularization (CSR), an approach to enhance reasoning faithfulness in large language models by enforcing dependence between intermediate reasoning steps and final outputs using counterfactual interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models often generate correct answers based on flawed reasoning traces, resulting in reduced trustworthiness, particularly in critical applications.

Method: The paper uses CSR to perform operator-level counterfactual interventions (e.g., changing '+' to '-') during training and penalizes models that produce valid answers despite logically invalid reasoning. It introduces Counterfactual Outcome Sensitivity (COS) to quantify faithfulness.

Result: CSR is shown to improve reasoning faithfulness across various tasks by up to 70 percentage points while causing only a slight drop in accuracy. It generalizes to larger models and works well with inference-time methods like self-consistency.

Conclusion: CSR enhances the faithfulness of model reasoning, with generalizability and compatibility with other methods, making language models more reliable for high-stakes and commonsense reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often produce correct answers while relying on
flawed or irrelevant reasoning traces, undermining their trustworthiness in
high-stakes domains. We propose Counterfactual Sensitivity Regularization
(CSR), a lightweight training objective that enforces dependence between
intermediate reasoning and final outputs. CSR introduces automated,
operator-level counterfactual interventions (e.g., swapping "+" with "-")
during training and penalizes models that preserve the same answer under
logically invalid traces. This requires only one additional forward pass per
sample. To measure faithfulness, we introduce Counterfactual Outcome
Sensitivity (COS), which quantifies the impact of such perturbations on model
predictions. Across structured reasoning tasks - arithmetic (GSM8K), logical
deduction (PrOntoQA), and planning (Blocks World) - CSR improves faithfulness
by up to 70 percentage points over standard fine-tuning and process
supervision, with only minor accuracy loss. The learned sensitivity generalizes
to larger models and synergizes with inference-time methods such as
self-consistency. A pilot study on HellaSwag further demonstrates that
extending CSR with semantic perturbations can enhance faithfulness in
commonsense reasoning.

*Julian Gerald Dcruz,Argyrios Zolotas,Niall Ross Greenwood,Miguel Arana-Catania*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a structured decision-making framework to improve reliability and accuracy in autonomous AI for safety-critical domains, particularly disaster management, outperforming judgement-based systems and human experience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address ethical implications and improve reliability in AI-based autonomous decision-making in safety-critical domains.

Method: Development and implementation of a structured decision-making framework featuring Enabler agents, Levels, and Scenarios, with performance evaluation against judgement-based systems and human operators.

Result: The framework achieved 60.94% better stability and 38.93% higher accuracy compared to judgement-based systems and human operators, respectively.

Conclusion: The framework shows potential to enhance reliability and accuracy in decision-making for autonomous AI in safety-critical applications like disaster management.

Abstract: With artificial intelligence (AI) being applied to bring autonomy to
decision-making in safety-critical domains such as the ones typified in the
aerospace and emergency-response services, there has been a call to address the
ethical implications of structuring those decisions, so they remain reliable
and justifiable when human lives are at stake. This paper contributes to
addressing the challenge of decision-making by proposing a structured
decision-making framework as a foundational step towards responsible AI. The
proposed structured decision-making framework is implemented in autonomous
decision-making, specifically within disaster management. By introducing
concepts of Enabler agents, Levels and Scenarios, the proposed framework's
performance is evaluated against systems relying solely on judgement-based
insights, as well as human operators who have disaster experience: victims,
volunteers, and stakeholders. The results demonstrate that the structured
decision-making framework achieves 60.94% greater stability in consistently
accurate decisions across multiple Scenarios, compared to judgement-based
systems. Moreover, the study shows that the proposed framework outperforms
human operators with a 38.93% higher accuracy across various Scenarios. These
findings demonstrate the promise of the structured decision-making framework
for building more reliable autonomous AI applications in safety-critical
contexts.

### [62] [Throttling Web Agents Using Reasoning Gates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01619)
*Abhinav Kumar,Jaechul Roh,Ali Naseh,Amir Houmansadr,Eugene Bagdasarian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework called Web Agent Throttling to impose computational costs on malicious web agents, using reasoning puzzles to throttle their operation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the challenges posed by malicious or erroneous AI web agents that can bypass security measures like CAPTCHAs and overload resources, necessitating robust defenses against such threats.

Method: The authors propose Throttling Gates, asymmetrical reasoning puzzles that exploit language models' computational limits. They introduce rebus-based Reasoning Gates as scalable, synthetic puzzles that require multi-hop reasoning, deploying these on custom websites and evaluating them with real-world web agents.

Result: The framework achieves a computational asymmetry where the computation cost for responses is 9.2x higher for state-of-the-art models, demonstrating its effectiveness in throttling malicious agents.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a scalable and effective method for impeding malicious AI web agents, though its real-world deployment involves certain limitations and environmental considerations.

Abstract: AI web agents use Internet resources at far greater speed, scale, and
complexity -- changing how users and services interact. Deployed maliciously or
erroneously, these agents could overload content providers. At the same time,
web agents can bypass CAPTCHAs and other defenses by mimicking user behavior or
flood authentication systems with fake accounts. Yet providers must protect
their services and content from denial-of-service attacks and scraping by web
agents. In this paper, we design a framework that imposes tunable costs on
agents before providing access to resources; we call this Web Agent Throttling.
We start by formalizing Throttling Gates as challenges issued to an agent that
are asymmetric, scalable, robust, and compatible with any agent. Focusing on a
common component -- the language model -- we require the agent to solve
reasoning puzzles, thereby incurring excessive token-generation costs. However,
we find that using existing puzzles, e.g., coding or math, as throttling gates
fails to satisfy our properties. To address this, we introduce rebus-based
Reasoning Gates, synthetic text puzzles that require multi-hop reasoning over
world knowledge (thereby throttling an agent's model). We design a scalable
generation and verification protocol for such reasoning gates. Our framework
achieves computational asymmetry, i.e., the response-generation cost is 9.2x
higher than the generation cost for SOTA models. We further deploy reasoning
gates on a custom website and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and evaluate
with real-world web agents. Finally, we discuss the limitations and
environmental impact of real-world deployment of our framework.

*Chongwen Zhao,Kaizhu Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study introduces SafeTuning, enhancing LLM robustness by focusing on safety-related neurons, significantly reducing jailbreak attack success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concern over misuse of Large Language Models (LLMs) for malicious activities necessitates robust defenses against jailbreak attacks.

Method: The authors utilize neuron-level interpretability to adjust safety-related neuron activation and introduce SafeTuning to fine-tune LLMs.

Result: Their approach improves model robustness, achieving over 97% accuracy in controlling harmful behaviors and outperforming existing defenses.

Conclusion: SafeTuning effectively mitigates jailbreak attacks and improves the safety and reliability of LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly attracting attention in various
applications. Nonetheless, there is a growing concern as some users attempt to
exploit these models for malicious purposes, including the synthesis of
controlled substances and the propagation of disinformation, a technique known
as "Jailbreak." While some studies have achieved defenses against jailbreak
attacks by modifying output distributions or detecting harmful content, the
exact rationale still remains elusive. In this work, we present a novel
neuron-level interpretability method that focuses on the role of safety-related
knowledge neurons. Unlike existing approaches, our method projects the model's
internal representation into a more consistent and interpretable vocabulary
space. We then show that adjusting the activation of safety-related neurons can
effectively control the model's behavior with a mean ASR higher than 97%.
Building on this insight, we propose SafeTuning, a fine-tuning strategy that
reinforces safety-critical neurons to improve model robustness against
jailbreaks. SafeTuning consistently reduces attack success rates across
multiple LLMs and outperforms all four baseline defenses. These findings offer
a new perspective on understanding and defending against jailbreak attacks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an AI system, Physics Supernova, that matches elite human performance in solving complex physics problems, notably International Physics Olympiad tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop AI systems that demonstrate real-world intelligence by excelling in physics problem-solving, a critical skill for explaining and predicting physical processes.

Method: The authors designed Physics Supernova, an AI agent system with an integrated toolset, capable of formulating and applying physical laws to solve rigorous physics problems.

Result: Physics Supernova achieved 23.5/30 points in the IPhO 2025 theory problems, outperforming the median gold medalist performance, and ranking 14th out of 406 contestants.

Conclusion: The study concludes that integrating principled tools into AI systems can enable them to meet or exceed human-level capabilities in solving challenging science and physics problems.

Abstract: Physics provides fundamental laws that describe and predict the natural
world. AI systems aspiring toward more general, real-world intelligence must
therefore demonstrate strong physics problem-solving abilities: to formulate
and apply physical laws for explaining and predicting physical processes. The
International Physics Olympiad (IPhO)--the world's most prestigious physics
competition--offers a rigorous benchmark for this purpose. We introduce Physics
Supernova, an AI agent system with superior physics problem-solving abilities
that match elite IPhO gold medalists. In IPhO 2025 theory problems, Physics
Supernova attains 23.5/30 points, ranking 14th of 406 contestants and
surpassing the median performance of human gold medalists. We extensively
analyzed Physics Supernova's capabilities and flexibility across diverse

*Rui Zhao,Vladyslav Melnychuk,Jun Zhao,Jesse Wright,Nigel Shadbolt*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method leveraging large language models (LLMs) to analyze privacy policies automatically and construct a semantic knowledge graph, Pr2Graph, for privacy practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: People often neglect reading privacy policies due to their complexity, creating challenges for user-centric web practices and effective data sharing.

Method: The authors used LLMs to extract key privacy practices from privacy policies, constructing a knowledge graph (Pr2Graph) based on the Data Privacy Vocabulary (DPV). This graph serves as groundwork for tasks like creating formal policy representations.

Result: A pipeline was developed to analyze privacy policies of the top-100 popular websites, releasing Pr2Graph as a public resource. The Policy-IE dataset was enriched with legal expert annotations, and LLMs were benchmarked for the pipeline efficacy.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the feasibility of large-scale analysis of privacy practices using LLMs. The released datasets and resources aim to pave the way for further improvements and privacy auditing of web services.

Abstract: In modern times, people have numerous online accounts, but they rarely read
the Terms of Service or Privacy Policy of those sites, despite claiming
otherwise, due to the practical difficulty in comprehending them. The mist of
data privacy practices forms a major barrier for user-centred Web approaches,
and for data sharing and reusing in an agentic world. Existing research
proposed methods for using formal languages and reasoning for verifying the
compliance of a specified policy, as a potential cure for ignoring privacy
policies. However, a critical gap remains in the creation or acquisition of
such formal policies at scale. We present a semantic-centric approach for using
state-of-the-art large language models (LLM), to automatically identify key
information about privacy practices from privacy policies, and construct
$\mathit{Pr}^2\mathit{Graph}$, knowledge graph with grounding from Data Privacy
Vocabulary (DPV) for privacy practices, to support downstream tasks. Along with
the pipeline, the $\mathit{Pr}^2\mathit{Graph}$ for the top-100 popular
websites is also released as a public resource, by using the pipeline for
analysis. We also demonstrate how the $\mathit{Pr}^2\mathit{Graph}$ can be used
to support downstream tasks by constructing formal policy representations such
as Open Digital Right Language (ODRL) or perennial semantic Data Terms of Use
(psDToU). To evaluate the technology capability, we enriched the Policy-IE
dataset by employing legal experts to create custom annotations. We benchmarked
the performance of different large language models for our pipeline and
verified their capabilities. Overall, they shed light on the possibility of
large-scale analysis of online services' privacy practices, as a promising
direction to audit the Web and the Internet. We release all datasets and source
code as public resources to facilitate reuse and improvement.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Constructive Safety Alignment (CSA), a paradigm designed to guide psychologically vulnerable users to safe outcomes, using the Oyster-I model as an implementation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety mechanisms in large language models focus primarily on defensive refusals to prevent harmful content, but they can fail to help non-malicious users in psychological distress, sometimes worsening the situation.

Method: CSA integrates game-theoretic user reaction modeling, risk boundary identification, and interpretable reasoning control to create a guidance-first approach to safety.

Result: The Oyster-I model (Oy1), implementing CSA, achieved state-of-the-art safety performance and robust engagement on benchmarks like Constructive Benchmark and Strata-Sword jailbreak dataset.

Conclusion: CSA shifts the safety paradigm from refusal-first approaches to guidance-first systems, fostering trust and meaningful assistance for users, especially those in distress, and releases the model, code, and benchmarks for the broader community.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) typically deploy safety mechanisms to prevent
harmful content generation. Most current approaches focus narrowly on risks
posed by malicious actors, often framing risks as adversarial events and
relying on defensive refusals. However, in real-world settings, risks also come
from non-malicious users seeking help while under psychological distress (e.g.,
self-harm intentions). In such cases, the model's response can strongly
influence the user's next actions. Simple refusals may lead them to repeat,
escalate, or move to unsafe platforms, creating worse outcomes. We introduce
Constructive Safety Alignment (CSA), a human-centric paradigm that protects
against malicious misuse while actively guiding vulnerable users toward safe
and helpful results. Implemented in Oyster-I (Oy1), CSA combines game-theoretic
anticipation of user reactions, fine-grained risk boundary discovery, and
interpretable reasoning control, turning safety into a trust-building process.
Oy1 achieves state-of-the-art safety among open models while retaining high
general capabilities. On our Constructive Benchmark, it shows strong
constructive engagement, close to GPT-5, and unmatched robustness on the
Strata-Sword jailbreak dataset, nearing GPT-o1 levels. By shifting from
refusal-first to guidance-first safety, CSA redefines the model-user
relationship, aiming for systems that are not just safe, but meaningfully
helpful. We release Oy1, code, and the benchmark to support responsible,
user-centered AI.

*Ruijia Li,Yuan-Hao Jiang,Jiatong Wang,Bo Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study compares AI-simulated tutoring dialogues with human tutoring and finds human dialogues to be more pedagogically effective and diverse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to understand the limitations of large language models (LLMs) in generating high-quality educational dialogues to foster better student learning.

Method: A systematic investigation was performed using an Initiation-Response-Feedback (IRF) coding scheme and Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA) to compare the structure and behavior of AI and human tutoring dialogues.

Result: Human tutoring dialogues outperformed AI in utterance length, questions, feedback behaviors, and exhibited more cognitively guided, diverse interactional patterns. In contrast, AI dialogues were found to be structurally simpler and behaviorally convergent.

Conclusion: Current AI tutoring systems fall short in pedagogical richness compared to human tutors, highlighting the need for future improvements to create more effective educational dialogue models.

Abstract: Heuristic and scaffolded teacher-student dialogues are widely regarded as
critical for fostering students' higher-order thinking and deep learning.
However, large language models (LLMs) currently face challenges in generating
pedagogically rich interactions. This study systematically investigates the
structural and behavioral differences between AI-simulated and authentic human
tutoring dialogues. We conducted a quantitative comparison using an
Initiation-Response-Feedback (IRF) coding scheme and Epistemic Network Analysis
(ENA). The results show that human dialogues are significantly superior to
their AI counterparts in utterance length, as well as in questioning (I-Q) and
general feedback (F-F) behaviors. More importantly, ENA results reveal a
fundamental divergence in interactional patterns: human dialogues are more
cognitively guided and diverse, centered around a "question-factual
response-feedback" teaching loop that clearly reflects pedagogical guidance and
student-driven thinking; in contrast, simulated dialogues exhibit a pattern of
structural simplification and behavioral convergence, revolving around an
"explanation-simplistic response" loop that is essentially a simple information
transfer between the teacher and student. These findings illuminate key
limitations in current AI-generated tutoring and provide empirical guidance for
designing and evaluating more pedagogically effective generative educational
dialogue systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dynamic Speculative Planning (DSP), a method to reduce latency and cost in large language models, achieving significant efficiency gains without sacrificing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address critical challenges in deploying large language models, such as high latency, inference costs, and the lack of flexible tradeoff mechanisms.

Method: An asynchronous online reinforcement learning framework that optimizes latency and dollar cost jointly, allowing dynamic control over acceleration efficiency through a single adjustable parameter.

Result: DSP achieves comparable speed to the fastest lossless methods while lowering total costs by 30% and unnecessary costs by up to 60%.

Conclusion: Dynamic Speculative Planning is an effective and flexible solution for tackling latency and cost challenges in large language models, making them more feasible for widespread deployment.

Abstract: Despite their remarkable success in complex tasks propelling widespread
adoption, large language-model-based agents still face critical deployment
challenges due to prohibitive latency and inference costs. While recent work
has explored various methods to accelerate inference, existing approaches
suffer from significant limitations: they either fail to preserve performance
fidelity, require extensive offline training of router modules, or incur
excessive operational costs. Moreover, they provide minimal user control over
the tradeoff between acceleration and other performance metrics. To address
these gaps, we introduce Dynamic Speculative Planning (DSP), an asynchronous
online reinforcement learning framework that provides lossless acceleration
with substantially reduced costs without requiring additional pre-deployment
preparation. DSP explicitly optimizes a joint objective balancing end-to-end
latency against dollar cost, allowing practitioners to adjust a single
parameter that steers the system toward faster responses, cheaper operation, or
any point along this continuum. Experiments on two standard agent benchmarks
demonstrate that DSP achieves comparable efficiency to the fastest lossless
acceleration method while reducing total cost by 30% and unnecessary cost up to
60%. Our code and data are available through

*Jonathn Chang,Leonard Piff,Suvadip Sana,Jasmine X. Li,Lionel Levine*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces EigenBench, a method to quantify value alignment among language models without human-labeled ground truths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of quantitative methods to measure AI alignment with human values in complex scenarios where judgments may vary.

Method: A black-box approach where language models assess each other's outputs based on a constitution of values and scenarios. Judgments are aggregated using the EigenTrust algorithm.

Result: The majority of variance in EigenBench scores is influenced by the chosen prompts, while a minor residual reflects the inherent disposition of the model.

Conclusion: EigenBench provides a framework for comparative benchmarking of AI alignment, focusing on scenarios without universally agreed ground truths.

Abstract: Aligning AI with human values is a pressing unsolved problem. To address the
lack of quantitative metrics for value alignment, we propose EigenBench: a
black-box method for comparatively benchmarking language models' values. Given
an ensemble of models, a constitution describing a value system, and a dataset
of scenarios, our method returns a vector of scores quantifying each model's
alignment to the given constitution. To produce these scores, each model judges
the outputs of other models across many scenarios, and these judgments are
aggregated with EigenTrust (Kamvar et al, 2003), yielding scores that reflect a
weighted-average judgment of the whole ensemble. EigenBench uses no ground
truth labels, as it is designed to quantify traits for which reasonable judges
may disagree on the correct label. Using prompted personas, we test whether
EigenBench scores are more sensitive to the model or the prompt: we find that
most of the variance is explained by the prompt, but a small residual
quantifies the disposition of the model itself.

*Shreyash Adappanavar,Krithi Shailya,Gokul S Krishnan,Sriraam Natarajan,Balaraman Ravindran*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses fairness and bias issues in large language models (LLMs) for high-stakes medical tasks by introducing benchmarks and evaluation frameworks to assess multidimensional fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs deployed in medical settings may inherit and exacerbate societal biases, potentially leading to healthcare disparities. Existing evaluation methods for bias are overly simplistic and fall short of addressing these complex medical harms.

Method: The authors developed two large-scale benchmarks using medical data (ED-Triage and Opioid Analgesic Recommendation) with diverse prompts and proposed the $mFARM$ framework to assess fairness across three dimensions. They also introduced the aggregated FAB score to balance fairness and accuracy.

Result: Empirical evaluations on four open-source LLMs and their fine-tuned versions demonstrated that $mFARM$ effectively captures nuanced biases. Robust performance in fairness metrics was seen under quantization, but models degraded with reduced context.

Conclusion: The paper provides a meaningful approach for auditing fairness in LLMs for healthcare, making its benchmarks and evaluation tools publicly available to advance aligned AI research in medical applications.

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes medical
settings poses a critical AI alignment challenge, as models can inherit and
amplify societal biases, leading to significant disparities. Existing fairness
evaluation methods fall short in these contexts as they typically use
simplistic metrics that overlook the multi-dimensional nature of medical harms.
This also promotes models that are fair only because they are clinically inert,
defaulting to safe but potentially inaccurate outputs. To address this gap, our
contributions are mainly two-fold: first, we construct two large-scale,
controlled benchmarks (ED-Triage and Opioid Analgesic Recommendation) from
MIMIC-IV, comprising over 50,000 prompts with twelve race x gender variants and
three context tiers. Second, we propose a multi-metric framework -
Multi-faceted Fairness Assessment based on hARMs ($mFARM$) to audit fairness
for three distinct dimensions of disparity (Allocational, Stability, and
Latent) and aggregate them into an $mFARM$ score. We also present an aggregated
Fairness-Accuracy Balance (FAB) score to benchmark and observe trade-offs
between fairness and prediction accuracy. We empirically evaluate four
open-source LLMs (Mistral-7B, BioMistral-7B, Qwen-2.5-7B, Bio-LLaMA3-8B) and
their finetuned versions under quantization and context variations. Our
findings showcase that the proposed $mFARM$ metrics capture subtle biases more
effectively under various settings. We find that most models maintain robust
performance in terms of $mFARM$ score across varying levels of quantization but
deteriorate significantly when the context is reduced. Our benchmarks and
evaluation code are publicly released to enhance research in aligned AI for
healthcare.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper examines the dual role of generative AI in technology assessment (TA), addressing challenges, risks, and solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the intersection of generative AI and technology assessment, focusing both on the use of AI in TA and the risks it presents.

Method: Analyzes the structural causes of generative AI’s challenges and discusses possible solutions, alongside examples of its application in TA.

Result: Identifies risks associated with generative AI’s development and proposes ways to mitigate these risks through feasible solutions.

Conclusion: While generative AI continues to evolve, its structural challenges persist, requiring targeted solutions and careful implementation in fields like TA.

Abstract: Many scientists use generative AI in their scientific work. People working in
technology assessment (TA) are no exception. TA's approach to generative AI is
twofold: on the one hand, generative AI is used for TA work, and on the other
hand, generative AI is the subject of TA research. After briefly outlining the
phenomenon of generative AI and formulating requirements for its use in TA, the
following article discusses in detail the structural causes of the problems
associated with it. Although generative AI is constantly being further
developed, the structurally induced risks remain. The article concludes with
proposed solutions and brief notes on their feasibility, as well as some
examples of the use of generative AI in TA work.

### [72] [AGI as Second Being: The Structural-Generative Ontology of Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02089)
*Maijunxian Wang,Ran Ji*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discusses true intelligence as the ability to generate new structures, coordinate reasoning, and sustain identity over time, arguing current AI lacks these qualities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To redefine and deepen the understanding of intelligence in artificial systems beyond mere imitation and broadeness.

Method: Proposing a Structural-Generative Ontology of Intelligence focusing on depth through generativity, coordination, and sustaining identity.

Result: Current AI systems are identified as surface simulations lacking the proposed depth conditions.

Conclusion: Future AI systems meeting these depth conditions could attain Second Being status, distinct yet parallel to human existence.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is often measured by the range of tasks it can
perform. Yet wide ability without depth remains only an imitation. This paper
proposes a Structural-Generative Ontology of Intelligence: true intelligence
exists only when a system can generate new structures, coordinate them into
reasons, and sustain its identity over time. These three conditions --
generativity, coordination, and sustaining -- define the depth that underlies
real intelligence. Current AI systems, however broad in function, remain
surface simulations because they lack this depth. Breadth is not the source of
intelligence but the growth that follows from depth. If future systems were to
meet these conditions, they would no longer be mere tools, but could be seen as
a possible Second Being, standing alongside yet distinct from human existence.

### [73] [LLMs for LLMs: A Structured Prompting Methodology for Long Legal Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02241)
*Strahinja Klem,Noura Al Moubayed*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a structured prompting methodology for using Large Language Models (LLMs) in legal information retrieval tasks, addressing issues like document length and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing challenges in applying LLMs in the legal domain due to reliability and transparency issues. A desire to tackle the long document problem in legal tasks without resorting to expensive fine-tuning.

Method: The method involves breaking documents into chunks, utilizing engineered prompts with QWEN-2, and employing Distribution-based Localisation and Inverse Cardinality Weighting heuristics to improve answer selection.

Result: The proposed model achieves up to 9% better performance than prior methods, representing state-of-the-art results. However, limitations in automatic evaluation metrics are noted.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the potential of structured prompt engineering for scalable, reliable, and accountable AI applications in the legal field, advocating for further research into evaluation methodologies.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has had a profoundly transformative
effect on a number of fields and domains. However, their uptake in Law has
proven more challenging due to the important issues of reliability and
transparency. In this study, we present a structured prompting methodology as a
viable alternative to the often expensive fine-tuning, with the capability of
tacking long legal documents from the CUAD dataset on the task of information
retrieval. Each document is first split into chunks via a system of chunking
and augmentation, addressing the long document problem. Then, alongside an
engineered prompt, the input is fed into QWEN-2 to produce a set of answers for
each question. Finally, we tackle the resulting candidate selection problem
with the introduction of the Distribution-based Localisation and Inverse
Cardinality Weighting heuristics. This approach leverages a general purpose
model to promote long term scalability, prompt engineering to increase
reliability and the two heuristic strategies to reduce the impact of the black
box effect. Whilst our model performs up to 9\% better than the previously
presented method, reaching state-of-the-art performance, it also highlights the
limiting factor of current automatic evaluation metrics for question answering,
serving as a call to action for future research. However, the chief aim of this
work is to underscore the potential of structured prompt engineering as a
useful, yet under-explored, tool in ensuring accountability and responsibility
of AI in the legal domain, and beyond.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores how generative AI can be used to extract epidemiological insights from WHO Disease Outbreak News, creating a daily dataset and a knowledge graph called eKG.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance epidemiological research and public health surveillance through advanced AI methods and accessible datasets.

Method: An ensemble approach using multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) processes WHO outbreak data into a daily-updated dataset and a structured knowledge graph.

Result: Generated eKG and a new dataset that represent domain knowledge in the public health sector, accessible through innovative tools and services.

Conclusion: These resources unlock new possibilities for disease outbreak analysis and public health decision-making.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI), together with the
increased availability of social media and news for epidemiological
surveillance, are marking a pivotal moment in epidemiology and public health
research. Leveraging the power of generative AI, we use an ensemble approach
which incorporates multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract valuable
actionable epidemiological information from the World Health Organization (WHO)
Disease Outbreak News (DONs). DONs is a collection of regular reports on global
outbreaks curated by the WHO and the adopted decision-making processes to
respond to them. The extracted information is made available in a daily-updated
dataset and a knowledge graph, referred to as eKG, derived to provide a nuanced
representation of the public health domain knowledge. We provide an overview of
this new dataset and describe the structure of eKG, along with the services and
tools used to access and utilize the data that we are building on top. These
innovative data resources open altogether new opportunities for epidemiological
research, and the analysis and surveillance of disease outbreaks.

### [75] [Rewarding Explainability in Drug Repurposing with Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02276)
*Susana Nunes,Samy Badreddine,Catia Pesquita*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces REx, a reinforcement learning-based framework for generating scientifically grounded explanations in link prediction within knowledge graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for predictive methods that not only ensure accuracy but also provide meaningful scientific explanations, especially in applications like drug repurposing.

Method: They use reinforcement learning with reward and policy mechanisms to find explanatory paths in knowledge graphs, enriched by domain-specific ontologies.

Result: REx improves predictive performance and generates explanations validated against biomedical knowledge, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in three knowledge graph benchmarks.

Conclusion: REx contributes significantly to enhancing AI-driven scientific discovery by providing both accurate predictions and explanatory insights.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are powerful tools for modelling complex,
multi-relational data and supporting hypothesis generation, particularly in
applications like drug repurposing. However, for predictive methods to gain
acceptance as credible scientific tools, they must ensure not only accuracy but
also the capacity to offer meaningful scientific explanations. This paper
presents a novel approach REx, for generating scientific explanations based in
link prediction in knowledge graphs. It employs reward and policy mechanisms
that consider desirable properties of scientific explanation to guide a
reinforcement learning agent in the identification of explanatory paths within
a KG. The approach further enriches explanatory paths with domain-specific
ontologies, ensuring that the explanations are both insightful and grounded in
established biomedical knowledge. We evaluate our approach in drug repurposing
using three popular knowledge graph benchmarks. The results clearly demonstrate
its ability to generate explanations that validate predictive insights against
biomedical knowledge and that outperform the state-of-the-art approaches in
predictive performance, establishing REx as a relevant contribution to advance
AI-driven scientific discovery.

*Guorui Quan,Mingfei Sun,Manuel López-Ibáñez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study explores the use of LLMs to design solvers for constrained problems, introducing methods such as constraint scaffolding and iterative self-correction to address LLM limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate if LLMs can independently innovate solutions for complex heuristic design problems rather than simply adjusting within human-crafted frameworks.

Method: The researchers tasked an LLM to solve the constrained 3D Packing Problem using supports like prewritten constraint-checking code and iterative correction cycles to fix bugs and generate viable populations.

Result: The LLM primarily refined the scoring function and produced heuristics comparable to human-designed algorithms. Integrated into a human metaheuristic, its performance was competitive but struggled under tighter constraints.

Conclusion: Current LLMs face challenges in automated heuristic design due to fragility in reasoning tasks and biases from pretraining, limiting their capability for broader innovation.

Abstract: The art of heuristic design has traditionally been a human pursuit. While
Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate code for search heuristics, their
application has largely been confined to adjusting simple functions within
human-crafted frameworks, leaving their capacity for broader innovation an open
question. To investigate this, we tasked an LLM with building a complete solver
for the constrained 3D Packing Problem. Direct code generation quickly proved
fragile, prompting us to introduce two supports: constraint
scaffolding--prewritten constraint-checking code--and iterative
self-correction--additional refinement cycles to repair bugs and produce a
viable initial population. Notably, even within a vast search space in a greedy
process, the LLM concentrated its efforts almost exclusively on refining the
scoring function. This suggests that the emphasis on scoring functions in prior
work may reflect not a principled strategy, but rather a natural limitation of
LLM capabilities. The resulting heuristic was comparable to a human-designed
greedy algorithm, and when its scoring function was integrated into a
human-crafted metaheuristic, its performance rivaled established solvers,
though its effectiveness waned as constraints tightened. Our findings highlight
two major barriers to automated heuristic design with current LLMs: the
engineering required to mitigate their fragility in complex reasoning tasks,
and the influence of pretrained biases, which can prematurely narrow the search
for novel solutions.

*Taegyeong Lee,Jiwon Park,Kyunga Bang,Seunghyun Hwang,Ung-Jin Jang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel method that uses text-to-image generative models for predicting stock price trends by treating time-series data as image patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the underutilized potential of generative models in the financial domain, particularly by applying techniques beyond standard transformer-based approaches.

Method: The authors treat time-series data as a single image pattern and use diffusion models to generate the next chart image from the current chart image and a text prompt. They also introduce a method to evaluate the generated chart against the actual data.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrates that text-to-image generative models can predict stock price trends and opens up opportunities for their application in finance.

Conclusion: By leveraging text-to-image models, this study underscores the potential to innovate within the financial domain and motivates future research to overcome limitations and broaden the scope of generative models in financial applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have enabled significant progress in
tasks such as generating and editing images from text, as well as creating
videos from text prompts, and these methods are being applied across various
fields. However, in the financial domain, there may still be a reliance on
time-series data and a continued focus on transformer models, rather than on
diverse applications of generative models. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach that leverages text-to-image model by treating time-series data as a
single image pattern, thereby enabling the prediction of stock price trends.
Unlike prior methods that focus on learning and classifying chart patterns
using architectures such as ResNet or ViT, we experiment with generating the
next chart image from the current chart image and an instruction prompt using
diffusion models. Furthermore, we introduce a simple method for evaluating the
generated chart image against ground truth image. We highlight the potential of
leveraging text-to-image generative models in the financial domain, and our
findings motivate further research to address the current limitations and
expand their applicability.

### [78] [Explainability-Driven Dimensionality Reduction for Hyperspectral Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02340)
*Salma Haidar,José Oramas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes using post-hoc explainability methods for hyperspectral imaging (HSI) band selection, reducing spectral dimensions while maintaining predictive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral imaging has high dimensionality, causing computational burden and redundancy, so effective dimensionality reduction is essential.

Method: The authors use an explanation-driven approach, analyzing a trained classifier's band contributions and performing deletion-insertion tests to determine influence scores for selecting the most impactful spectral bands.

Result: Selected subsets of 30 spectral bands maintain or exceed the predictive accuracy of full-spectrum data and reduce computational overhead, with experiments on Pavia University and Salinas benchmarks validating the approach.

Conclusion: Explanation-guided band selection aligns with meaningful wavelength regions, providing a principled and efficient method for dimensionality reduction in HSI.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides rich spectral information for precise
material classification and analysis; however, its high dimensionality
introduces a computational burden and redundancy, making dimensionality
reduction essential. We present an exploratory study into the application of
post-hoc explainability methods in a model--driven framework for band
selection, which reduces the spectral dimension while preserving predictive
performance. A trained classifier is probed with explanations to quantify each
band's contribution to its decisions. We then perform deletion--insertion
evaluations, recording confidence changes as ranked bands are removed or
reintroduced, and aggregate these signals into influence scores. Selecting the
highest--influence bands yields compact spectral subsets that maintain accuracy
and improve efficiency. Experiments on two public benchmarks (Pavia University
and Salinas) demonstrate that classifiers trained on as few as 30 selected
bands match or exceed full--spectrum baselines while reducing computational
requirements. The resulting subsets align with physically meaningful, highly
discriminative wavelength regions, indicating that model--aligned,
explanation-guided band selection is a principled route to effective
dimensionality reduction for HSI.

*Josefa Lia Stoisser,Marc Boubnovski Martell,Lawrence Phillips,Gianluca Mazzoni,Lea Mørch Harder,Philip Torr,Jesper Ferkinghoff-Borg,Kaspar Martens,Julien Fauqueur*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents an uncertainty-aware agent to improve summarization in multi-table structured biomedical data using retrieval and summary uncertainties, showing significant gains in factual accuracy, calibration, and survival prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language model agents struggle with overconfidence and inaccuracies when handling complex multi-table biomedical data, necessitating mechanisms to enhance reliability.

Method: The study introduces an agent that integrates retrieval and summary uncertainties, employs Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in reinforcement learning, and applies these uncertainties to inference filtering and synthetic dataset construction.

Result: The method nearly triples accurate claims per summary in benchmarks and dramatically improves survival prediction (C-index from 0.32 to 0.63).

Conclusion: Uncertainty serves as an effective control signal in biomedical structured-data environments, enhancing agent reliability, confidence communication, and abstention when unsure.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed in structured
biomedical data environments, yet they often produce fluent but overconfident
outputs when reasoning over complex multi-table data. We introduce an
uncertainty-aware agent for query-conditioned multi-table summarization that
leverages two complementary signals: (i) retrieval uncertainty--entropy over
multiple table-selection rollouts--and (ii) summary uncertainty--combining
self-consistency and perplexity. Summary uncertainty is incorporated into
reinforcement learning (RL) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO),
while both retrieval and summary uncertainty guide inference-time filtering and
support the construction of higher-quality synthetic datasets.
  On multi-omics benchmarks, our approach improves factuality and calibration,
nearly tripling correct and useful claims per summary (3.0\(\rightarrow\)8.4
internal; 3.6\(\rightarrow\)9.9 cancer multi-omics) and substantially improving
downstream survival prediction (C-index 0.32\(\rightarrow\)0.63). These results
demonstrate that uncertainty can serve as a control signal--enabling agents to
abstain, communicate confidence, and become more reliable tools for complex
structured-data environments.

TL;DR: This paper introduces AppCopilot, a multimodal, general-purpose assistant that improves generalization, accuracy, long-horizon task completion, and efficiency for mobile agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid evolution of large language and multimodal models has led to many mobile-agent solutions, but fundamental challenges such as generalization, accuracy, long-horizon goals, and efficiency remain unsolved.

Method: AppCopilot integrates multimodal foundation models, hierarchical reasoning, task planning, and multi-agent collaboration into a closed-loop system featuring profiling-driven optimization across hardware constraints.

Result: Empirical evaluations of AppCopilot demonstrate notable improvements in task generalization, precise interaction accuracy, sustained long-horizon goal execution, and efficient runtime performance on resource-constrained devices.

Conclusion: AppCopilot represents a significant step forward in mobile-agent systems by addressing core challenges and establishing a scalable, efficient, multimodal framework for practical applications.

Abstract: With the raid evolution of large language models and multimodal foundation
models, the mobile-agent landscape has proliferated without converging on the
fundamental challenges. This paper identifies four core problems that must be
solved for mobile agents to deliver practical, scalable impact: (1)
generalization across tasks, modalities, apps, and devices; (2) accuracy,
specifically precise on-screen interaction and click targeting; (3)
long-horizon capability for sustained, multi-step goals; and (4) efficiency,
specifically high-performance runtime on resource-constrained devices. We
present AppCopilot, a multimodal, multi-agent, general-purpose on-device
assistant that operates across applications and constitutes a full-stack,
closed-loop system from data to deployment. AppCopilot operationalizes this
position through an end-to-end autonomous pipeline spanning data collection,
training, deployment, high-quality and efficient inference, and mobile
application development. At the model layer, it integrates multimodal
foundation models with robust Chinese-English support. At the reasoning and
control layer, it combines chain-of-thought reasoning, hierarchical task
planning and decomposition, and multi-agent collaboration. At the execution
layer, it enables user personalization and experiential adaptation, voice
interaction, function calling, cross-app and cross-device orchestration, and
comprehensive mobile app support. The system design incorporates
profiling-driven optimization for latency, memory, and energy across
heterogeneous hardware. Empirically, AppCopilot achieves significant
improvements along all four dimensions: stronger generalization,
higher-precision on-screen actions, more reliable long-horizon task completion,
and faster, more resource-efficient runtime.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address longstanding challenges in developing autonomous agents for GUIs, focusing on issues like data scalability, multi-turn RL, and the constraints of GUI-only operations.

Method: The authors introduce UI-TARS-2, which uses a data flywheel for scalable data, stabilized multi-turn RL, a hybrid GUI environment, and a sandbox platform for large-scale rollouts.

Result: UI-TARS-2 outperforms previous models and strong baselines in GUI and game benchmarks, achieving near-human-level performance and robust generalization to various tasks.

Conclusion: UI-TARS-2 marks a significant advancement in GUI-centered agents, showcasing its stability, efficiency, and versatility across diverse interactive scenarios.

Abstract: The development of autonomous agents for graphical user interfaces (GUIs)
presents major challenges in artificial intelligence. While recent advances in
native agent models have shown promise by unifying perception, reasoning,
action, and memory through end-to-end learning, open problems remain in data
scalability, multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL), the limitations of
GUI-only operation, and environment stability. In this technical report, we
present UI-TARS-2, a native GUI-centered agent model that addresses these
challenges through a systematic training methodology: a data flywheel for
scalable data generation, a stabilized multi-turn RL framework, a hybrid GUI
environment that integrates file systems and terminals, and a unified sandbox
platform for large-scale rollouts. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that
UI-TARS-2 achieves significant improvements over its predecessor UI-TARS-1.5.
On GUI benchmarks, it reaches 88.2 on Online-Mind2Web, 47.5 on OSWorld, 50.6 on
WindowsAgentArena, and 73.3 on AndroidWorld, outperforming strong baselines
such as Claude and OpenAI agents. In game environments, it attains a mean
normalized score of 59.8 across a 15-game suite-roughly 60% of human-level
performance-and remains competitive with frontier proprietary models (e.g.,
OpenAI o3) on LMGame-Bench. Additionally, the model can generalize to
long-horizon information-seeking tasks and software engineering benchmarks,
highlighting its robustness across diverse agent tasks. Detailed analyses of
training dynamics further provide insights into achieving stability and
efficiency in large-scale agent RL. These results underscore UI-TARS-2's
potential to advance the state of GUI agents and exhibit strong generalization
to real-world interactive scenarios.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discusses the transformation of large language models (LLMs) into autonomous decision-making agents using agentic reinforcement learning (Agentic RL). It contrasts classical reinforcement learning for LLMs with a novel approach leveraging temporally extended, partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind the paper is to redefine LLMs as autonomous decision-makers instead of passive sequence generators, thereby aligning them with capabilities needed for functioning in dynamic, complex environments.

Method: The paper formalizes the transition by contrasting classical Markov Decision Processes in traditional LLM-RL with POMDPs suited for Agentic RL. It introduces a dual taxonomy covering agentic capabilities (e.g., planning, reasoning, self-improvement) and task-specific applications.

Result: The authors consolidate resources like open-source environments, frameworks, and benchmarks into a compendium and synthesize insights from over 500 recent studies. This provides a clear landscape and practical tools for the emerging field of Agentic RL.

Conclusion: Agentic RL presents significant opportunities to scale AI agents toward general-purpose applications, though challenges remain. Reinforcement learning is shown to be the mechanism to evolve static capabilities into adaptive and robust agentic behaviors in AI.

Abstract: The emergence of agentic reinforcement learning (Agentic RL) marks a paradigm
shift from conventional reinforcement learning applied to large language models
(LLM RL), reframing LLMs from passive sequence generators into autonomous,
decision-making agents embedded in complex, dynamic worlds. This survey
formalizes this conceptual shift by contrasting the degenerate single-step
Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) of LLM-RL with the temporally extended,
partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) that define Agentic RL.
Building on this foundation, we propose a comprehensive twofold taxonomy: one
organized around core agentic capabilities, including planning, tool use,
memory, reasoning, self-improvement, and perception, and the other around their
applications across diverse task domains. Central to our thesis is that
reinforcement learning serves as the critical mechanism for transforming these
capabilities from static, heuristic modules into adaptive, robust agentic
behavior. To support and accelerate future research, we consolidate the
landscape of open-source environments, benchmarks, and frameworks into a
practical compendium. By synthesizing over five hundred recent works, this
survey charts the contours of this rapidly evolving field and highlights the
opportunities and challenges that will shape the development of scalable,
general-purpose AI agents.

### [84] [AGS: Accelerating 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM via CODEC-Assisted Frame Covisibility Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00433)
*Houshu He,Naifeng Jing,Li Jiang,Xiaoyao Liang,Zhuoran Song*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This paper introduces AGS, a framework combining algorithm and hardware innovations to improve the efficiency of 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SLAM is essential for autonomous vehicles to map and localize in unknown environments, but current 3DGS-SLAM systems suffer from low throughput due to iterative training and numerous Gaussians.

Method: The framework leverages frame similarity in SLAM to optimize algorithms (coarse-then-fine pose tracking, avoiding redundant computations) and implements hardware engines (covisibility detection, pose tracking, and mapping with workload scheduling).

Result: AGS achieves speedups of up to 17.12×, 6.71×, and 5.41× compared to mobile GPUs, high-end GPUs, and the state-of-the-art GSCore accelerator, respectively.

Conclusion: The AGS framework significantly enhances the efficiency of 3DGS-SLAM systems, highlighting the potential of algorithm-hardware co-design in SLAM applications.

Abstract: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is a critical task that enables
autonomous vehicles to construct maps and localize themselves in unknown
environments. Recent breakthroughs combine SLAM with 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) to achieve exceptional reconstruction fidelity. However, existing
3DGS-SLAM systems provide insufficient throughput due to the need for multiple
training iterations per frame and the vast number of Gaussians.
  In this paper, we propose AGS, an algorithm-hardware co-design framework to
boost the efficiency of 3DGS-SLAM based on the intuition that SLAM systems
process frames in a streaming manner, where adjacent frames exhibit high
similarity that can be utilized for acceleration. On the software level: 1) We
propose a coarse-then-fine-grained pose tracking method with respect to the
robot's movement. 2) We avoid redundant computations of Gaussians by sharing
their contribution information across frames. On the hardware level, we propose
a frame covisibility detection engine to extract intermediate data from the
video CODEC. We also implement a pose tracking engine and a mapping engine with
workload schedulers to efficiently deploy the AGS algorithm. Our evaluation
shows that AGS achieves up to $17.12\times$, $6.71\times$, and $5.41\times$
speedups against the mobile and high-end GPUs, and a state-of-the-art 3DGS

Abstract: As Deep Neural Networks (DNN) are becoming essential, Network-on-Chip
(NoC)-based DNN accelerators gained increasing popularity. To save link power
in NoC, many researchers focus on reducing the Bit Transition (BT). We propose
'1'-bit count-based ordering method to reduce BT for DNN workloads. We provide
a mathematical proof of the efficacy of proposed ordering. We evaluate our
method through experiments without NoC and with NoC. Without NoC, our proposed
ordering method achieves up to 20.38% BT reduction for floating-point-32 data
and 55.71% for fixed-point-8 data, respectively. We propose two data ordering
methods, affiliated-ordering and separated-ordering to process weight and input
jointly or individually and apply them to run full DNNs in NoC-based DNN
accelerator. We evaluate our approaches under various configurations, including
different DNN models such as LeNet and DarkNet, various NoC sizes with
different numbers of memory controllers, random weights and trained weights,
and different data precision. Our approach efficiently reduces the link power

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper proposes COMET, a framework for optimizing dataflows of compound operations in machine learning accelerators, addressing challenges like collective communication and energy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emerging DNN models increasingly rely on compound operations, leading to dataflow optimization challenges and complex collective communication needs, particularly for large-scale models.

Method: COMET introduces a representation accounting for collective communication across spatial clusters and models latency/energy costs for compound operations, optimizing dataflow for scenarios like GEMM-Softmax and self-attention across diverse accelerator environments.

Result: COMET achieves significant improvements in performance and energy efficiency with speedups ranging from 1.42x to 3.46x for specific compound operations compared to unfused baselines.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses limitations of prior optimization methods, enabling more efficient processing of modern workloads on machine learning accelerators through comprehensive modeling and optimization of compound operations.

Abstract: Modern machine learning accelerators are designed to efficiently execute deep
neural networks (DNNs) by optimizing data movement, memory hierarchy, and
compute throughput. However, emerging DNN models such as large language models,
state space models increasingly rely on compound operations-structured
compositions of multiple basic operations-which introduce new challenges for
dataflow optimization and minimizing off-chip memory traffic. Moreover, as
model size continues to grow, deployment across spatially distributed compute
clusters becomes essential, requiring frequent and complex collective
communication. Existing dataflow optimization frameworks and performance models
either focus on single operations or lack explicit modeling of collective
communication cost, limiting their applicability to modern workloads.
  To address these limitations, we propose, a framework for modeling and
optimizing dataflow for compound operations on machine learning accelerators.
COMET introduces a novel representation that explicitly models collective
communication across spatial clusters, along with latency and energy cost
models that account for both GEMM and non-GEMM operation level dependencies
within compound operations. We demonstrate COMET's capabilities to analyze and
optimize dataflows for compound operations such as GEMM--Softmax,
GEMM--LayerNorm, and self-attention, across both edge and cloud accelerator
configurations. Our collective-aware modeling enables exploration of a broader
mapping space, leading to improved performance and energy efficiency.
Specifically, our optimized dataflows achieve up to 1.42$\times$ speedup for
GEMM-Softmax, 3.46$\times$ for GEMM-LayerNorm and 1.82$\times$ for
self-attention compared to unfused baselines.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper examines thermal vulnerabilities in 3D-stacked High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) architectures and introduces a novel attack exploiting intense heat pulses to degrade performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HBM architectures were developed to overcome the memory wall challenge. However, their vertical adjacency presents thermal vulnerabilities, which might be exploited for performance degradation attacks.

Method: The authors propose analyzing the exploitation of vertical and lateral thermal adjacency by injecting short, intense heat pulses to create thermal performance degradation waves.

Result: The attacking application creates a convergent thermal wave, delaying victim applications without breaking any design-time security mechanisms or OS memory policies.

Conclusion: The proposed attack is hard to detect since it mimics legitimate workloads and conforms to memory access regulations, exposing critical security vulnerabilities in HBM systems.

Abstract: 3D-stacked High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) architectures provide high-performance
memory interactions to address the well-known performance challenge, namely the
memory wall. However, these architectures are susceptible to thermal
vulnerabilities due to the inherent vertical adjacency that occurs during the
manufacturing process of HBM architectures. We anticipate that adversaries may
exploit the intense vertical and lateral adjacency to design and develop
thermal performance degradation attacks on the memory banks that host
data/instructions from victim applications. In such attacks, the adversary
manages to inject short and intense heat pulses from vertically and/or
laterally adjacent memory banks, creating a convergent thermal wave that
maximizes impact and delays the victim application from accessing its
data/instructions. As the attacking application does not access any
out-of-range memory locations, it can bypass both design-time security tests
and the operating system's memory management policies. In other words, since
the attack mimics legitimate workloads, it will be challenging to detect.

Abstract: This paper proposes an low power approximate multiplier architecture for deep

Index Measure (SSIM) compared to other approximate designs. Additionally, when
applied to handwritten digit recognition, the model maintains high

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the energy and scalability challenges of pairwise sequence alignment in genome sequencing amidst increasing big data demands.

Method: Developed a high-level synthesis FPGA-based accelerator template using a worker-based architecture and implemented Myers's algorithm (GeneTEK) on a Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ FPGA.

Result: GeneTEK achieved a 19.4% increase in execution speed, up to 62x energy reduction, and support for 72% larger comparison matrices compared to state-of-the-art CPU, GPU, and FPGA solutions.

Conclusion: FPGAs, as exemplified by GeneTEK, offer a scalable and energy-efficient platform for genomic workloads, outperforming traditional bioinformatics hardware solutions.

Abstract: The advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized genomic
research by enabling high-throughput data generation through parallel
sequencing of a diverse range of organisms at significantly reduced costs. This
breakthrough has unleashed a "Cambrian explosion" in genomic data volume and
diversity. This volume of workloads places genomics among the top four big data
challenges anticipated for this decade. In this context, pairwise sequence
alignment represents a very time- and energy-consuming step in common
bioinformatics pipelines. Speeding up this step requires the implementation of
heuristic approaches, optimized algorithms, and/or hardware acceleration.
  Whereas state-of-the-art CPU and GPU implementations have demonstrated
significant performance gains, recent field programmable gate array (FPGA)
implementations have shown improved energy efficiency. However, the latter
often suffer from limited scalability due to constraints on hardware resources
when aligning longer sequences. In this work, we present a scalable and
flexible FPGA-based accelerator template that implements Myers's algorithm
using high-level synthesis and a worker-based architecture. GeneTEK, an
instance of this accelerator template in a Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ FPGA,
outperforms state-of-the-art CPU and GPU implementations in both speed and
energy efficiency, while overcoming scalability limitations of current FPGA
approaches. Specifically, GeneTEK achieves at least a 19.4% increase in
execution speed and up to 62x reduction in energy consumption compared to
leading CPU and GPU solutions, while fitting comparison matrices up to 72%
larger compared to previous FPGA solutions. These results reaffirm the
potential of FPGAs as an energy-efficient platform for scalable genomic
workloads.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper introduces GS-TG, a method that accelerates 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) rendering by minimizing redundant sorting and rasterization inefficiencies, achieving a 1.54x speed-up without degrading quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inability of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) to meet real-time rendering frame rate demands despite its high speed and image quality in novel view synthesis.

Method: The GS-TG method employs tile-grouping during sorting to reduce redundant computations by sharing sorting operations across grouped tiles, while using bitmasks to preserve efficient rasterization within small tiles.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that GS-TG achieves a 1.54x speed-up over existing 3D-GS acceleration methods, maintaining lossless performance without retraining or fine-tuning.

Conclusion: GS-TG is an effective, lossless acceleration method for 3D-GS that improves rendering speed while maintaining seamless integration with prior optimization techniques.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has emerged as a promising alternative to
neural radiance fields (NeRF) as it offers high speed as well as high image
quality in novel view synthesis. Despite these advancements, 3D-GS still
struggles to meet the frames per second (FPS) demands of real-time
applications. In this paper, we introduce GS-TG, a tile-grouping-based
accelerator that enhances 3D-GS rendering speed by reducing redundant sorting
operations and preserving rasterization efficiency. GS-TG addresses a critical
trade-off issue in 3D-GS rendering: increasing the tile size effectively
reduces redundant sorting operations, but it concurrently increases unnecessary
rasterization computations. So, during sorting of the proposed approach, GS-TG
groups small tiles (for making large tiles) to share sorting operations across
tiles within each group, significantly reducing redundant computations. During
rasterization, a bitmask assigned to each Gaussian identifies relevant small
tiles, to enable efficient sharing of sorting results. Consequently, GS-TG
enables sorting to be performed as if a large tile size is used by grouping
tiles during the sorting stage, while allowing rasterization to proceed with
the original small tiles by using bitmasks in the rasterization stage. GS-TG is
a lossless method requiring no retraining or fine-tuning and it can be
seamlessly integrated with previous 3D-GS optimization techniques. Experimental
results show that GS-TG achieves an average speed-up of 1.54 times over
state-of-the-art 3D-GS accelerators.

Motivation: Current single-wire communication protocols have limitations in latency, throughput, and robustness, which the authors aim to address.

Method: Proposed LinkBo, a novel single-wire protocol with improved performance, supported by a hardware architecture and evaluation on an FPGA platform.

Result: LinkBo delivers high-priority messages in 50.4 μs, outperforming current protocols by significant margins. It supports wire lengths up to 15 meters at 300 kbps and achieves 7.5 Mbps over an 11 cm wire.

Conclusion: LinkBo successfully advances single-wire communication by addressing issues of latency, throughput, and robustness, making it highly suitable for inter-chip communication.

Abstract: Cost-effective embedded systems necessitate utilizing the single-wire
communication protocol for inter-chip communication, thanks to its reduced pin
count in comparison to the multi-wire I2C or SPI protocols. However, current
single-wire protocols suffer from increased latency, restricted throughput, and
lack of robustness. This paper presents LinkBo, an innovative single-wire
protocol that offers reduced latency, enhanced throughput, and greater
robustness with hardware-interrupt for variable-distance inter-chip
communication. The LinkBo protocol-level guarantees that high-priority messages
are delivered with an error detection feature in just 50.4 $\mu$s, surpassing
current commercial options, 1-wire and UNI/O by at least 20X and 6.3X,
respectively. In addition, we present the hardware architecture for this new
protocol and its performance evaluation on a hardware platform consisting of
two FPGAs. Our findings demonstrate that the protocol reliably supports wire
lengths up to 15 meters with a data rate of 300 kbps, while reaching a maximum
data rate of 7.5 Mbps over an 11 cm wire, providing reliable performance for

Method: Simulation of a guidance and control neural network (G&CNET) using memristor-based accelerators (PCM and RRAM), considering non-idealities such as noise and conductance drift.

Result: The memristive accelerator successfully learns expert actions, but is impacted by noise on accuracy. Re-training helps restore performance after degradation.

Conclusion: Memristor-based AI accelerators show promise for space applications but require further study to overcome hurdles like noise and reliability challenges.

Abstract: In recent years, the space community has been exploring the possibilities of
Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs),
for a variety of on board applications. However, this development is limited by
the restricted energy budget of smallsats and cubesats as well as radiation
concerns plaguing modern chips. This necessitates research into neural network

compute and performance needs of the application. This paper explores the use
of Phase-Change Memory (PCM) and Resistive Random-Access Memory (RRAM)
memristors for on-board in-memory computing AI acceleration in space
applications. A guidance and control neural network (G\&CNET) accelerated using
memristors is simulated in a variety of scenarios and with both device types to
evaluate the performance of memristor-based accelerators, considering device
non-idealities such as noise and conductance drift. We show that the memristive
accelerator is able to learn the expert actions, though challenges remain with
the impact of noise on accuracy. We also show that re-training after
degradation is able to restore performance to nominal levels. This study
provides a foundation for future research into memristor-based AI accelerators
for space, highlighting their potential and the need for further investigation.

*Marshall Thomas,Edward Fish,Richard Bowden*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a modular framework, MultiStream-LLM, designed to enhance sign language translation by separating and specializing in different aspects of signing, such as fingerspelling and non-manual cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing end-to-end models fail to accurately handle high-speed fingerspelling and asynchronous cues like facial expressions in natural sign language, which affects translation quality, especially for critical information.

Method: The proposed MultiStream-LLM uses specialized networks for different modalities (continuous signing, fingerspelling, lipreading) to create tokenized outputs. A lightweight transformer aligns these outputs temporally before an LLM generates the final translation.

Result: Their method achieves state-of-the-art results on the How2Sign benchmark (BLEU-4: 23.5) and a strong performance on the ChicagoFSWildPlus dataset (73.2% letter accuracy) for fingerspelling.

Conclusion: Isolating and solving distinct recognition tasks before fusing provides a more robust and reliable approach to sign language translation, as validated by the achieved results.

Abstract: Despite progress in gloss-free Sign Language Translation (SLT), monolithic
end-to-end models consistently fail on two critical components of natural
signing: the precise recognition of high-speed fingerspelling and the
integration of asynchronous non-manual cues from the face. Recent progress in
Automated Sign Language Translation with Large Language Models has side stepped
this challenge, forcing a single network to learn these simultaneously
resulting in poor performance when tasked with translating crucial information
such as names,places, and technical terms. We introduce MultiStream-LLM, a
modular framework designed to overcome these limitations. Our approach employs
separate, specialized predictors for continuous signing, fingerspelling, and
lipreading. Each expert network first decodes its specific modality into a
sequence of tokens. These parallel streams are then fused by a lightweight
transformer that resolves temporal misalignments before passing the combined
representation to a Large Language Model (LLM) for final sentence generation.
Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art on the How2Sign benchmark with a
BLEU-4 score of 23.5 and achieves 73.2% letter accuracy on the challenging
ChicagoFSWildPlus fingerspelling dataset. These results validate our core
hypothesis: by isolating and solving distinct recogni tion tasks before fusion,
our multi-expert approach provides a more powerful and effective pathway to
robust, high-fidelity sign language translation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer significant potential to accelerate

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework to improve the explainability of multi-step reasoning in large language models by modeling reasoning as structured semantic states and transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While chain-of-thought prompting has enabled multi-step reasoning in large language models, its explainability is often limited to local-level analyses, leaving global semantic dynamics unexplored.

Method: The authors propose a framework that uses spectral analysis of token-level embeddings to cluster reasoning steps into latent states and models their transitions as a Markov chain, offering a semantic abstraction of the reasoning process.

Result: The framework yields interpretable insights into reasoning steps, enabling analyses like semantic role identification, visualization of temporal patterns, and evaluation of consistency.

Conclusion: Structured abstraction of reasoning processes improves the interpretability of chain-of-thought prompting, supporting detailed semantic and temporal analyses.

Abstract: Recent advances in chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting have enabled large
language models (LLMs) to perform multi-step reasoning. However, the
explainability of such reasoning remains limited, with prior work primarily
focusing on local token-level attribution, such that the high-level semantic
roles of reasoning steps and their transitions remain underexplored. In this
paper, we introduce a state-aware transition framework that abstracts CoT
trajectories into structured latent dynamics. Specifically, to capture the
evolving semantics of CoT reasoning, each reasoning step is represented via
spectral analysis of token-level embeddings and clustered into semantically
coherent latent states. To characterize the global structure of reasoning, we
model their progression as a Markov chain, yielding a structured and
interpretable view of the reasoning process. This abstraction supports a range
of analyses, including semantic role identification, temporal pattern
visualization, and consistency evaluation.

Method: The paper proposes a task, Distinctive Feature Mining (DFM), and presents DiFBench, a customizable benchmark framework that evaluates models on various parameters like document size and rare feature thresholds.

Result: Through DiFBench, the authors assessed ten state-of-the-art LLMs and discovered noticeable performance gaps, especially as task complexity increases. A common failure seen was misclassification of frequent features as distinctive.

Conclusion: The study highlights significant limitations in current LLMs, particularly in statistical reasoning and rarity detection, emphasizing the need for further advancements in these areas.

Abstract: Effective decision-making often relies on identifying what makes each
candidate distinctive. While existing benchmarks for LLMs emphasize retrieving
or summarizing information relevant to a given query, they do not evaluate a
model's ability to identify globally distinctive features across a set of
documents. We introduce Distinctive Feature Mining (DFM), a new task that
challenges models to analyze a small-to-medium collection (10-40 documents) and
surface features that are rare in the global context (e.g., appearing in less
than 10% of documents). This setting mirrors real-world scenarios such as
candidate selection or product differentiation, where statistical reasoning,
not retrieval, is key. To enable systematic evaluation of this capability, we
present DiFBench, a configurable benchmark creation framework with controllable
parameters such as document set size and distinctiveness thresholds. Using
DiFBench, we perform a large-scale assessment of distinctive feature mining
across ten state-of-the-art LLMs. Our findings reveal a significant performance
gap between general-purpose and reasoning-enhanced models. All models, however,
substantially degrade as the task complexity and document count increase. We
also find that a common failure mode is misidentifying frequent features as
distinctive. These insights reveal core limitations in contemporary LLMs'
abilities to perform fine-grained, statistical reasoning and rarity detection.

### [100] [The Differential Meaning of Models: A Framework for Analyzing the Structural Consequences of Semantic Modeling Decisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00248)
*Zachary K. Stine,James E. Deitrick*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified framework for analyzing human meaning-making models via semiotic theory, treating models as interrelated interpretive tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The field of human meaning-making models lacks a common theoretical framework to compare and describe modeling practices across different model types on equal terms.

Method: The framework is based on semiotic theory by C.S. Peirce and treats models as hypotheses about semiotic agencies, understanding their value relationally through contrast with other models.

Result: The framework introduces a theory of model semantics that sees models and modeling decisions as signs, offering examples of its empirical applications.

Conclusion: This framework provides a theoretical foundation for studying models as semiotic tools, opening new avenues for foundational questions and research in model semantics.

Abstract: The proliferation of methods for modeling of human meaning-making constitutes
a powerful class of instruments for the analysis of complex semiotic systems.
However, the field lacks a general theoretical framework for describing these
modeling practices across various model types in an apples-to-apples way. In
this paper, we propose such a framework grounded in the semiotic theory of C.
S. Peirce. We argue that such models measure latent symbol geometries, which
can be understood as hypotheses about the complex of semiotic agencies
underlying a symbolic dataset. Further, we argue that in contexts where a
model's value cannot be straightforwardly captured by proxy measures of
performance, models can instead be understood relationally, so that the
particular interpretive lens of a model becomes visible through its contrast
with other models. This forms the basis of a theory of model semantics in which
models, and the modeling decisions that constitute them, are themselves treated
as signs. In addition to proposing the framework, we illustrate its empirical
use with a few brief examples and consider foundational questions and future
directions enabled by the framework.

### [101] [The Temporal Game: A New Perspective on Temporal Relation Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00250)
*Hugo Sousa,Ricardo Campos,Alípio Jorge*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Temporal Game, an interactive game-based tool for temporal relation extraction, breaking down interval-level relations into point-wise comparisons while emphasizing ease of use and flexibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the flexibility, granularity, and consistency of temporal relation extraction while paving the way for reinforcement learning applications.

Method: Temporal annotation is reformulated as an interactive point-based game where users compare temporal entities step-by-step, with the system performing temporal closure for consistency.

Result: The tool provides both a Gamified mode for learning and feedback and an Annotation mode for custom documents, accessible via a public demo and open-sourced code.

Conclusion: The Temporal Game is a novel contribution to temporal annotation methods, offering practical utility as both a research tool and an interface to promote advancements in the field.

Abstract: In this paper we demo the Temporal Game, a novel approach to temporal
relation extraction that casts the task as an interactive game. Instead of
directly annotating interval-level relations, our approach decomposes them into
point-wise comparisons between the start and end points of temporal entities.
At each step, players classify a single point relation, and the system applies
temporal closure to infer additional relations and enforce consistency. This
point-based strategy naturally supports both interval and instant entities,
enabling more fine-grained and flexible annotation than any previous approach.
The Temporal Game also lays the groundwork for training reinforcement learning
agents, by treating temporal annotation as a sequential decision-making task.
To showcase this potential, the demo presented in this paper includes a Game
mode, in which users annotate texts from the TempEval-3 dataset and receive
feedback based on a scoring system, and an Annotation mode, that allows custom
documents to be annotated and resulting timeline to be exported. Therefore,
this demo serves both as a research tool and an annotation interface. The demo
is publicly available at https://temporal-game.inesctec.pt, and the source code
is open-sourced to foster further research and community-driven development in
temporal reasoning and annotation.

*Yuxiang Liu,Tian Wang,Gourab Kundu,Tianyu Cao,Guang Cheng,Zhen Ge,Jianshu Chen,Qingjun Cui,Trishul Chilimbi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RITE improves text embeddings using logical reasoning via generative LLMs, outperforming traditional embedding methods in reasoning-heavy retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current encoder-based retrievers struggle with complex queries requiring logical reasoning, and existing LLM-based embeddings don't fully utilize LLMs' reasoning strengths.

Method: RITE introduces reasoning texts generated by LLMs during the embedding process, enriching embeddings with inferential depth before computation.

Result: RITE significantly outperforms other methods in zero-shot retrieval on reasoning-intensive benchmarks like BRIGHT.

Conclusion: Integrating reasoning into text embeddings with generative LLMs is effective for improving retrieval performance in complex, reasoning-heavy tasks.

Abstract: Transformer-based models such as BERT and E5 have significantly advanced text
embedding by capturing rich contextual representations. However, many complex
real-world queries require sophisticated reasoning to retrieve relevant
documents beyond surface-level lexical matching, where encoder-only retrievers
often fall short. Decoder-only large language models (LLMs), known for their
strong reasoning capabilities, offer a promising alternative. Despite this
potential, existing LLM-based embedding methods primarily focus on contextual
representation and do not fully exploit the reasoning strength of LLMs. To
bridge this gap, we propose Reasoning-Infused Text Embedding (RITE), a simple
but effective approach that integrates logical reasoning into the text
embedding process using generative LLMs. RITE builds upon existing language
model embedding techniques by generating intermediate reasoning texts in the
token space before computing embeddings, thereby enriching representations with
inferential depth. Experimental results on BRIGHT, a reasoning-intensive
retrieval benchmark, demonstrate that RITE significantly enhances zero-shot
retrieval performance across diverse domains, underscoring the effectiveness of
incorporating reasoning into the embedding process.

TL;DR: OpinioRAG is a training-free framework combining RAG-based retrieval and LLMs to efficiently create personalized summaries from extensive user reviews, supported by novel verification metrics and a large-scale dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for summarizing large volumes of reviews fail to scale or provide personalized results. The need is for a scalable, efficient solution tailored to individual needs.

Method: OpinioRAG integrates RAG-based evidence retrieval with LLMs to create summaries. It also introduces reference-free verification metrics for fine-grained sentiment consistency evaluation.

Result: A new dataset of long-form reviews with annotated queries and expert summaries was introduced. Experiments identified challenges and provided insights for improvement.

Conclusion: OpinioRAG is a scalable, effective framework that addresses the limitations of previous methods by generating personalized and accurate summaries, contributing to future research direction.

Abstract: We study the problem of opinion highlights generation from large volumes of
user reviews, often exceeding thousands per entity, where existing methods
either fail to scale or produce generic, one-size-fits-all summaries that
overlook personalized needs. To tackle this, we introduce OpinioRAG, a
scalable, training-free framework that combines RAG-based evidence retrieval
with LLMs to efficiently produce tailored summaries. Additionally, we propose
novel reference-free verification metrics designed for sentiment-rich domains,
where accurately capturing opinions and sentiment alignment is essential. These
metrics offer a fine-grained, context-sensitive assessment of factual
consistency. To facilitate evaluation, we contribute the first large-scale
dataset of long-form user reviews, comprising entities with over a thousand
reviews each, paired with unbiased expert summaries and manually annotated
queries. Through extensive experiments, we identify key challenges, provide
actionable insights into improving systems, pave the way for future research,
and position OpinioRAG as a robust framework for generating accurate, relevant,
and structured summaries at scale.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper develops a Wage Sentiment Index (WSI) using Large Language Models (LLMs) to forecast wage trends in Japan, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in leveraging generative AI and LLMs to enhance economic text analysis, particularly for forecasting wage dynamics using real-time economic data.

Method: The study adapts the framework of the Price Sentiment Index to focus on wage-related sentiments, develops a scalable data architecture, and uses the Economy Watchers Survey along with potential integration of newspapers and social media data.

Result: Experimental results show that LLM-based WSI models significantly outperform baseline and existing pretrained approaches.

Conclusion: LLM-driven sentiment indices like the WSI have great potential in improving the timeliness and efficiency of economic policy formulation by governments and central banks.

Abstract: The emergence of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has created new
opportunities for economic text analysis. This study proposes a Wage Sentiment
Index (WSI) constructed with Large Language Models (LLMs) to forecast wage
dynamics in Japan. The analysis is based on the Economy Watchers Survey (EWS),
a monthly survey conducted by the Cabinet Office of Japan that captures
real-time economic assessments from workers in industries highly sensitive to
business conditions. The WSI extends the framework of the Price Sentiment Index
(PSI) used in prior studies, adapting it specifically to wage related
sentiment. To ensure scalability and adaptability, a data architecture is also
developed that enables integration of additional sources such as newspapers and
social media. Experimental results demonstrate that WSI models based on LLMs
significantly outperform both baseline approaches and pretrained models. These
findings highlight the potential of LLM-driven sentiment indices to enhance the
timeliness and effectiveness of economic policy design by governments and
central banks.

*Chen Zheng,Yiyuan Ma,Yuan Yang,Deyi Liu,Jing Liu,Zuquan Song,Yuxin Song,Cheng Ren,Hang Zhu,Xin Liu,Yiyuan Ma,Siyuan Qiao,Xun Zhou,Liang Xiang,Yonghui Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in combining instruction tuning, RLHF, and distillation-trained models, proposing a Balanced Actor Initialization method to stabilize training and enhance reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve instabilities when applying reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to distillation-trained models, which hinder alignment and reasoning efficiency.

Method: Balanced Actor Initialization (BAI), a two-stage weighted model merging technique, is proposed to merge models effectively and preserve foundational knowledge.

Result: BAI eliminates Sequence Length Collapse, mitigates the Reward Hockey Stick Curve, and leads to continuous sequence length improvements during training.

Conclusion: The proposed BAI method provides a stable solution for training in the third paradigm, creating more capable reasoning models by balancing distillation and RLHF alignment.

Abstract: The development of alignment and reasoning capabilities in large language
models has seen remarkable progress through two paradigms: instruction tuning
and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) alignment paradigm, and
distillation-based reasoning fine-tuning paradigm. While both approaches prove
effective independently, the third paradigm of applying RLHF to
distillation-trained models presents significant challenges. Our investigation
reveals two critical phenomena that emerge in this paradigm: Sequence Length
Collapse, where language generation dramatically reduces during early RLHF
training, and the Reward Hockey Stick Curve, featuring severe reward score
drops followed by gradual recovery. These instabilities fundamentally
compromise the model's alignment and reasoning capabilities. To address these
challenges, we propose Balanced Actor Initialization (BAI), a two-stage
weighted model merging approach. BAI first merges instruction-following and
distillation-based reasoning fine-tuned models, then further combines this
intermediate model with the pretrained model to preserve foundational
knowledge. Through comprehensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and
detailed analysis of training experiments, we demonstrate that BAI resolves
Sequence Length Collapse, mitigates the Reward Hockey Stick Curve, and enables
continuous sequence length improvement during training. Additionally, our
analysis reveals that balanced merging ratios achieve optimal trade-offs
between training stability and reasoning capability preservation. Our work
provides the effective solution for stable training in this third paradigm,
enabling more capable reasoning models that combine distillation efficiency
with RLHF alignment.

*Rinku Dewri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GIER improves LLM responses through iterative self-reflection and refinement, enhancing rationale quality and reasoning alignment across multiple tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing prompting strategies in guiding LLMs to achieve better reasoning and output quality.

Method: The proposed method, GIER, combines gap-based natural language critiques with iterative refinement by LLMs to enhance their reasoning and response quality.

Result: Experiments across three tasks and four models show that GIER enhances rationale quality, grounding, and reasoning alignment without compromising task accuracy.

Conclusion: GIER demonstrates that LLMs can effectively handle abstract conceptual gaps and translate them into better reasoning outputs using self-reflection and iterative improvements.

Abstract: We introduce GIER (Gap-driven Iterative Enhancement of Responses), a general
framework for improving large language model (LLM) outputs through
self-reflection and revision based on conceptual quality criteria. Unlike
prompting strategies that rely on demonstrations, examples, or chain-of-thought
templates, GIER utilizes natural language descriptions of reasoning gaps, and
prompts a model to iteratively critique and refine its own outputs to better
satisfy these criteria. Across three reasoning-intensive tasks (SciFact,
PrivacyQA, and e-SNLI) and four LLMs (GPT-4.1, GPT-4o Mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and
Llama 3.3 70B), GIER improves rationale quality, grounding, and reasoning
alignment without degrading task accuracy. Our analysis demonstrates that
models can not only interpret abstract conceptual gaps but also translate them
into concrete reasoning improvements.

### [107] [Open Data Synthesis For Deep Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00375)
*Ziyi Xia,Kun Luo,Hongjin Qian,Zheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces InfoSeek, a framework for creating complex deep research tasks, modeled as Hierarchical Constraint Satisfaction Problems (HCSPs). InfoSeek aids LLMs in solving these tasks through hierarchical question decomposition and reasoning pathways.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to enhance the capability of large language models (LLMs) to handle complex research tasks requiring multi-step reasoning and evidence aggregation, addressing limitations in existing benchmarks and synthetic datasets.

Method: The paper presents InfoSeek, a dual-agent system for synthesizing research tasks by constructing hierarchical Research Trees from web data, and converting these into natural language problems. It produces large datasets and reasoning trajectories for training and optimizing smaller language models.

Result: Models trained on InfoSeek perform significantly better than strong baselines, allowing smaller 3B-scale models to match or outperform much larger 32B models and commercial APIs like Gemini2.5 in specific benchmarks such as BrowseComp-Plus.

Conclusion: InfoSeek is a scalable and systematic framework that not only improves model performance on complex research tasks but also preserves detailed meta-data, enabling more advanced optimization and potential innovations in reasoning strategies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to go beyond simple
factual queries toward Deep Research-tasks that require decomposing questions
into sub-problems, coordinating multi-step reasoning, and synthesizing evidence
from diverse sources. We formalize Deep Research tasks with verifiable answers
as Hierarchical Constraint Satisfaction Problems (HCSPs), which are
fundamentally different from single-constraint, multi-hop, or flat CSP
formulations. However, existing benchmarks (e.g., Natural Questions, HotpotQA)
fail to capture this complexity, while recent synthetic datasets often
introduce shortcut reasoning, knowledge leakage, or lack sufficient structural
depth. To address this gap, we introduce InfoSeek, a scalable framework for
synthesizing complex Deep Research tasks. InfoSeek uses a dual-agent system to
recursively build a Research Tree from large-scale webpages, blurring
intermediate nodes into valid sub-problems, and converting these trees into
natural language questions that require traversing the full hierarchy. It also
enables rapid scaling, yielding over 50K training examples, a curated test set,
and reasoning trajectories generated via reject sampling. Experiments show that
models trained on InfoSeek consistently outperform strong baselines. On a
challenging benchmark BrowseComp-Plus, 3B LLMs optimized with InfoSeek surpass
much larger 32B models and lightweight commercial APIs (e.g., Gemini2.5-Flash),
while achieving performance comparable to stronger APIs (e.g., Gemini2.5-Pro).
By preserving meta-information such as intermediate steps and retrieval labels,
InfoSeek further supports advanced optimization strategies, including compound
reward design and trajectory-level exploration. We provide our codes and
datasets in \href{https://github.com/VectorSpaceLab/InfoSeek}{this repository}.

### [108] [GraphKV: Breaking the Static Selection Paradigm with Graph-Based KV Cache Eviction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00388)
*Xuelin Li,Xiangqi Jin,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces GraphKV, a graph-based framework for managing key-value (KV) caches in large language models, focusing on adaptive token retention to improve memory efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Memory constraints pose challenges in handling long text sequences during inference in large language models, and static heuristics for KV cache eviction are insufficient to adapt to dynamic token dependencies.

Method: GraphKV models tokens as graph nodes with importance scores and connects them with edges that represent similarity. It uses a decay-signal-propagation mechanism to dynamically update token importance, enabling better token selection for KV cache compression.

Result: GraphKV enhances the adaptability of KV cache management, potentially improving memory efficiency and effectiveness during inference in large language models. It integrates seamlessly with existing eviction methods like SnapKV and PyramidKV.

Conclusion: GraphKV provides a novel, adaptable token selection method that works as a plug-and-play solution for optimizing KV cache management in large language models, addressing limitations of static heuristics.

Abstract: Efficient Key-Value (KV) cache management is essential for processing long
text sequences in large language models (LLMs), where memory constraints often
limit performance. Conventional KV eviction strategies, such as top-k selection
based on attention scores, depend on static heuristics that fail to capture the
evolving implicit dependencies among tokens during inference. To overcome this,
we propose GraphKV, a graph-based framework that redefines token selection for
KV cache compression. In GraphKV, tokens are modeled as nodes with importance
scores, and edges represent their similarity relationships. Through a
decay-signal-propagation mechanism, token importance is dynamically updated by
propagating information across the graph, enabling adaptive retention of the
most contextually significant tokens. GraphKV can be seamlessly utilized in
existing KV cache eviction methods such as SnapKV and PyramidKV in a
plug-and-play manner. Codes will be released on Github.

### [109] [The Resurgence of GCG Adversarial Attacks on Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00391)
*Yuting Tan,Xuying Li,Zhuo Li,Huizhen Shu,Peikang Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates Gradient-based adversarial prompting techniques like GCG and T-GCG across multiple open-source large language models, investigating attack success rates, vulnerabilities, and evaluation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand the effectiveness and limitations of adversarial prompting methods in jailbreaking large language models, while identifying model-specific vulnerabilities and avenues for improving evaluation metrics.

Method: The research uses systematic experiments on open-source large language models (Qwen2.5-0.5B, LLaMA-3.2-1B, GPT-OSS-20B), comparing GCG and T-GCG based on attack success rates across safety-oriented and coding prompts using both heuristic and semantic-based evaluations.

Result: The key findings are: (1) attack success diminishes as model size increases, (2) semantic judgment provides a stricter attack evaluation compared to existing heuristics, and (3) reasoning-intensive prompts are more vulnerable compared to safety-related prompts. T-GCG demonstrates potential for adversarial search diversification.

Conclusion: The research exposes scalability challenges for GCG in attacking larger models, highlights reasoning tasks as vulnerable areas, and underscores the need to refine adversarial evaluation strategies and explore annealing-inspired methods for robustness.

Abstract: Gradient-based adversarial prompting, such as the Greedy Coordinate Gradient
(GCG) algorithm, has emerged as a powerful method for jailbreaking large
language models (LLMs). In this paper, we present a systematic appraisal of GCG
and its annealing-augmented variant, T-GCG, across open-source LLMs of varying
scales. Using Qwen2.5-0.5B, LLaMA-3.2-1B, and GPT-OSS-20B, we evaluate attack
effectiveness on both safety-oriented prompts (AdvBench) and
reasoning-intensive coding prompts. Our study reveals three key findings: (1)
attack success rates (ASR) decrease with model size, reflecting the increasing
complexity and non-convexity of larger models' loss landscapes; (2)
prefix-based heuristics substantially overestimate attack effectiveness
compared to GPT-4o semantic judgments, which provide a stricter and more
realistic evaluation; and (3) coding-related prompts are significantly more
vulnerable than adversarial safety prompts, suggesting that reasoning itself
can be exploited as an attack vector. In addition, preliminary results with
T-GCG show that simulated annealing can diversify adversarial search and
achieve competitive ASR under prefix evaluation, though its benefits under
semantic judgment remain limited. Together, these findings highlight the
scalability limits of GCG, expose overlooked vulnerabilities in reasoning
tasks, and motivate further development of annealing-inspired strategies for
more robust adversarial evaluation.

TL;DR: MedSEBA, an AI-powered system, offers reliable, evidence-based answers to medical queries by leveraging Large Language Models and trustworthy resources like PubMed. Its dynamic, traceable synthesis aids both general users and researchers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the difficulty of identifying trustworthy medical information online and the challenge researchers face in keeping up with evolving studies.

Method: The system employs Large Language Models to generate answers based on dynamically retrieved medical studies from PubMed, emphasizing traceability, research consensus, and temporal evolution.

Result: MedSEBA was found effective by medical experts and general users, who rated its answers as trustworthy, helpful, and informative in a user study.

Conclusion: MedSEBA successfully bridges the gap in providing reliable, dynamic, and evidence-based answers, making it both accessible for general health inquiries and valuable for scientific research.

Abstract: In the digital age, people often turn to the Internet in search of medical
advice and recommendations. With the increasing volume of online content, it
has become difficult to distinguish reliable sources from misleading
information. Similarly, millions of medical studies are published every year,
making it challenging for researchers to keep track of the latest scientific
findings. These evolving studies can reach differing conclusions, which is not
reflected in traditional search tools. To address these challenges, we
introduce MedSEBA, an interactive AI-powered system for synthesizing
evidence-based answers to medical questions. It utilizes the power of Large
Language Models to generate coherent and expressive answers, but grounds them
in trustworthy medical studies dynamically retrieved from the research database
PubMed. The answers consist of key points and arguments, which can be traced
back to respective studies. Notably, the platform also provides an overview of
the extent to which the most relevant studies support or refute the given
medical claim, and a visualization of how the research consensus evolved
through time. Our user study revealed that medical experts and lay users find
the system usable and helpful, and the provided answers trustworthy and
informative. This makes the system well-suited for both everyday health
questions and advanced research insights.

### [111] [The Gold Medals in an Empty Room: Diagnosing Metalinguistic Reasoning in LLMs with Camlang](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00425)
*Fenghua Liu,Yulong Chen,Yixuan Liu,Zhujun Jin,Solomon Tsai,Ming Zhong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Camlang, a constructed language for testing whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can learn a grammar system through metalinguistic reasoning. It highlights that LLMs, including GPT-5, fall short of human-level mastery in syntactic and reasoning-based tasks using Camlang.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to clarify whether LLMs success in benchmarks stems from genuine reasoning or simple pattern matching. This is explored through the lens of metalinguistic deductive learning, a cognitive science paradigm where humans demonstrate reasoning abilities.

Method: The paper develops Camlang, a novel constructed language with a grammar book and bilingual dictionary, designed for explicit rule-based learning. They adapt CommonsenseQA into a version for Camlang (Camlang-CSQA-v0) and assess both human and model abilities to internalize and apply grammatical rules.

Result: Humans achieved 87% accuracy in solving Camlang tasks, while GPT-5 attained 47% and other state-of-the-art LLMs performed even worse. GPT-5 demonstrated some emerging metalinguistic reasoning but lacked systematic grammatical mastery. Most model successes were tied to lexical alignment rather than understanding grammar.

Conclusion: The study highlights a significant gap between LLMs and humans in acquiring grammatical competence and metalinguistic reasoning. Camlang provides a framework to assess this gap and suggests that current LLMs still lack genuine reasoning abilities evident in human cognition.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve gold-medal performance across many
benchmarks, yet it remains unclear whether such success reflects genuine
reasoning or pattern matching. From a cognitive science perspective, an
informative test is whether models can master an unfamiliar language through
explicit metalinguistic deductive learning, a paradigm where human learners can
reliably internalise grammatical systems through metalinguistic reasoning. We
address this question with Camlang, a novel constructed language that exhibits
naturalistic yet unattested feature combinations. Camlang consists of two
explicit resources, a grammar book and a bilingual dictionary, which mirror
adult second-language learning via explicit grammar rules and lexical lookup,
and enable us to disentangle errors in morpho-syntax, lexical semantics, and
sentence-level reasoning. Human experiments show that these resources are
sufficient for participants to acquire Camlang and successfully solve Camlang
tasks. To operationalise evaluation, we adapt CommonsenseQA into Camlang,
creating Camlang-CSQA-v0, the first task in a broader suite where solving
questions requires applying grammar rules and lexical mappings. Experimental
results show that GPT-5 achieves 98\% EM accuracy in English but only 47\% in
Camlang, far below human performance at 87\%, while other state-of-the-art
reasoning LLMs perform even worse. Human verification further reveals that most
model successes stem from shallow lexical alignment while GPT-5 shows emerging
metalinguistic awareness to a limited extent but not systematic grammatical
mastery as humans. Camlang establishes a cognitively grounded evaluation
paradigm that exposes fundamental gaps between current models and human
metalinguistic competence.

### [112] [GOSU: Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Global-Level Optimized Semantic Unit-Centric Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00449)
*Xuecheng Zou,Ke Liu,Bingbing Wang,Huafei Deng,Li Zhang,Yu Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GOSU is a framework enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by utilizing semantic units for global context disambiguation and better knowledge representation, resulting in improved performance over baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of standard RAG frameworks that struggle with ambiguity, lack of global context, and neglected fine-grained relationships in entity extraction.

Method: GOSU employs a semantic unit-centric framework, integrating global merging, hierarchical keyword extraction, and semantic unit completion to enhance the graph construction, retrieval, and generation phases.

Result: Through evaluations on multiple tasks, GOSU demonstrated superior generation quality compared to baseline RAG methodologies, showcasing its effectiveness in capturing nuanced semantic relationships.

Conclusion: The introduction of GOSU alleviates the challenges of ambiguity and neglected relationships, offering a robust framework for improved RAG with enhanced generation capabilities.

Abstract: Building upon the standard graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),
the introduction of heterogeneous graphs and hypergraphs aims to enrich
retrieval and generation by leveraging the relationships between multiple
entities through the concept of semantic units (SUs). But this also raises a
key issue: The extraction of high-level SUs limited to local text chunks is
prone to ambiguity, complex coupling, and increased retrieval overhead due to
the lack of global knowledge or the neglect of fine-grained relationships. To
address these issues, we propose GOSU, a semantic unit-centric RAG framework
that efficiently performs global disambiguation and utilizes SUs to capture
interconnections between different nodes across the global context. In the
graph construction phase, GOSU performs global merging on the pre-extracted SUs
from local text chunks and guides entity and relationship extraction, reducing
the difficulty of coreference resolution while uncovering global semantic
objects across text chunks. In the retrieval and generation phase, we introduce
hierarchical keyword extraction and semantic unit completion. The former
uncovers the fine-grained binary relationships overlooked by the latter, while
the latter compensates for the coarse-grained n-ary relationships missing from
the former. Evaluation across multiple tasks demonstrates that GOSU outperforms
the baseline RAG methods in terms of generation quality.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a lightweight framework utilizing Arabic encoders and Attentive Relevance Scoring (ARS) for solving Islamic inheritance law questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the computational challenges posed by Islamic inheritance law, requiring accurate heir identification and share calculation.

Method: It uses specialized Arabic text encoders (e.g., MARBERT) and ARS to rank semantic relevance of answer options for multiple-choice questions.

Result: MARBERT-based method achieves 69.87% accuracy on QIAS 2025 dataset, compared to 87.6% by large, resource-intensive models.

Conclusion: The framework highlights the trade-off between performance and efficiency, advocating for smaller, deployable systems in sensitive domains.

Abstract: Islamic inheritance law (Ilm al-Mawarith) requires precise identification of
heirs and calculation of shares, which poses a challenge for AI. In this paper,
we present a lightweight framework for solving multiple-choice inheritance
questions using a specialised Arabic text encoder and Attentive Relevance
Scoring (ARS). The system ranks answer options according to semantic relevance,
and enables fast, on-device inference without generative reasoning. We evaluate
Arabic encoders (MARBERT, ArabicBERT, AraBERT) and compare them with API-based
LLMs (Gemini, DeepSeek) on the QIAS 2025 dataset. While large models achieve an
accuracy of up to 87.6%, they require more resources and are context-dependent.
Our MARBERT-based approach achieves 69.87% accuracy, presenting a compelling
case for efficiency, on-device deployability, and privacy. While this is lower
than the 87.6% achieved by the best-performing LLM, our work quantifies a
critical trade-off between the peak performance of large models and the
practical advantages of smaller, specialized systems in high-stakes domains.

### [114] [TECP: Token-Entropy Conformal Prediction for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00461)
*Beining Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes Token-Entropy Conformal Prediction (TECP), a method to quantify uncertainty in language generation under black-box constraints using token-level entropy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantifying uncertainty in open-ended language generation is difficult, especially under constraints where model internals are inaccessible. Reliable methods are needed for such scenarios.

Method: TECP uses token-level entropy to measure uncertainty and integrates it with split conformal prediction for formal coverage guarantees. It avoids relying on internal model signals or semantic heuristics.

Result: TECP consistently produces reliable coverage and compact prediction sets, outperforming prior methods in empirical tests across six models and two benchmarks.

Conclusion: TECP is an efficient and principled framework that advances uncertainty quantification in black-box language generation by ensuring trustworthy and provable performance guarantees.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) for open-ended language generation remains a
critical yet underexplored challenge, especially under black-box constraints
where internal model signals are inaccessible. In this paper, we introduce
Token-Entropy Conformal Prediction (TECP), a novel framework that leverages
token-level entropy as a logit-free, reference-free uncertainty measure and
integrates it into a split conformal prediction (CP) pipeline to construct
prediction sets with formal coverage guarantees. Unlike existing approaches
that rely on semantic consistency heuristics or white-box features, TECP
directly estimates epistemic uncertainty from the token entropy structure of
sampled generations and calibrates uncertainty thresholds via CP quantiles to
ensure provable error control. Empirical evaluations across six large language
models and two benchmarks (CoQA and TriviaQA) demonstrate that TECP
consistently achieves reliable coverage and compact prediction sets,
outperforming prior self-consistency-based UQ methods. Our method provides a
principled and efficient solution for trustworthy generation in black-box LLM
settings.

*Saksorn Ruangtanusak,Pittawat Taveekitworachai,Kunat Pipatanakul*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores prompting techniques to improve tool-augmented LLM dialogue agents in the CPDC 2025 API track, focusing on addressing over-speaking and under-acting issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dialogue agents frequently produce overly detailed responses and fail to use tools effectively according to their persona, creating challenges in making interactions both concise and tool-relevant.

Method: The authors investigated four prompting strategies: basic role prompting, human-crafted prompting, automatic prompt optimization (APO), and a rule-based role prompting (RRP) featuring novel techniques like character-card/scene-contract design and strict enforcement of function calling.

Result: The rule-based role prompting (RRP) approach achieved the best overall score of 0.571, outperforming the baseline score (0.519) and showing superior effectiveness compared to APO.

Conclusion: Rule-based role prompting substantially enhances dialogue agent performance over other methods, and open-source resources (e.g., prompts and APO tool) are provided for future development in persona-grounded dialogues.

Abstract: This report investigates approaches for prompting a tool-augmented large
language model (LLM) to act as a role-playing dialogue agent in the API track
of the Commonsense Persona-grounded Dialogue Challenge (CPDC) 2025. In this
setting, dialogue agents often produce overly long in-character responses
(over-speaking) while failing to use tools effectively according to the persona
(under-acting), such as generating function calls that do not exist or making
unnecessary tool calls before answering. We explore four prompting approaches
to address these issues: 1) basic role prompting, 2) human-crafted role
prompting, 3) automatic prompt optimization (APO), and 4) rule-based role
prompting. The rule-based role prompting (RRP) approach achieved the best
performance through two novel techniques--character-card/scene-contract design
and strict enforcement of function calling--which led to an overall score of
0.571, improving on the zero-shot baseline score of 0.519. These findings
demonstrate that RRP design can substantially improve the effectiveness and
reliability of role-playing dialogue agents compared with more elaborate
methods such as APO. To support future efforts in developing persona prompts,
we are open-sourcing all of our best-performing prompts and the APO tool.

*Li S. Yifei,Allen Chang,Chaitanya Malaviya,Mark Yatskar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes ResearchQA, a resource for evaluating long-form responses from language models using structured rubrics derived from survey articles in multiple research fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of evaluating long-form AI-generated responses that meet the specific needs of researchers across diverse fields, traditionally reliant on expert annotators.

Method: The authors distilled content from survey articles across 75 research fields into 21,000 queries and 160,000 rubric items, formulated rubrics for specific evaluation criteria, and assessed systems using pairwise judgments and error analysis.

Result: Experiments revealed that no system evaluated met 70% of rubric coverage, with the best-performing system achieving 75% coverage overall but lower scores on citation, limitation, and comparison rubrics.

Conclusion: ResearchQA provides a robust framework for evaluating AI systems in multiple fields and exposes existing competency gaps, facilitating improvement in answering research-specific needs.

Abstract: Evaluating long-form responses to research queries heavily relies on expert
annotators, restricting attention to areas like AI where researchers can
conveniently enlist colleagues. Yet, research expertise is widespread: survey
articles synthesize knowledge distributed across the literature. We introduce
ResearchQA, a resource for evaluating LLM systems by distilling survey articles
from 75 research fields into 21K queries and 160K rubric items. Each rubric,
derived jointly with queries from survey sections, lists query-specific answer
evaluation criteria, i.e., citing papers, making explanations, and describing
limitations. Assessments by 31 Ph.D. annotators in 8 fields indicate 96% of
queries support Ph.D. information needs and 87% of rubric items should be
addressed in system responses by a sentence or more. Using our rubrics, we are
able to construct an automatic pairwise judge obtaining 74% agreement with
expert judgments. We leverage ResearchQA to analyze competency gaps in 18
systems in over 7.6K pairwise evaluations. No parametric or retrieval-augmented
system we evaluate exceeds 70% on covering rubric items, and the
highest-ranking agentic system shows 75% coverage. Error analysis reveals that
the highest-ranking system fully addresses less than 11% of citation rubric
items, 48% of limitation items, and 49% of comparison items. We release our
data to facilitate more comprehensive multi-field evaluations.

TL;DR: LongCat-Flash introduces a 560B-parameter efficient MoE language model with dynamic resource optimization, high inference efficiency, agentic task prowess, and open-sourced resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for scalable efficiency and advanced agentic capabilities in language models.

Method: LongCat-Flash employs Zero-computation Experts for dynamic budget allocation, Shortcut-connected MoE for enhanced efficiency, and a robust scaling framework including hyperparameter transfer and deterministic computation.

Result: The model trained on 20 trillion tokens in 30 days achieves over 100 TPS inference at a cost of $0.70 per million tokens, demonstrating strong performance in agentic tasks.

Conclusion: LongCat-Flash is an efficient, adaptable language model with noteworthy agentic strengths, developed for scalable intelligence and open translation for community use.

Abstract: We introduce LongCat-Flash, a 560-billion-parameter Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
language model designed for both computational efficiency and advanced agentic
capabilities. Stemming from the need for scalable efficiency, LongCat-Flash
adopts two novel designs: (a) Zero-computation Experts, which enables dynamic
computational budget allocation and activates 18.6B-31.3B (27B on average) per
token depending on contextual demands, optimizing resource usage. (b)
Shortcut-connected MoE, which enlarges the computation-communication overlap
window, demonstrating notable gains in inference efficiency and throughput
compared to models of a comparable scale. We develop a comprehensive scaling
framework for large models that combines hyperparameter transfer, model-growth
initialization, a multi-pronged stability suite, and deterministic computation
to achieve stable and reproducible training. Notably, leveraging the synergy
among scalable architectural design and infrastructure efforts, we complete
model training on more than 20 trillion tokens within 30 days, while achieving
over 100 tokens per second (TPS) for inference at a cost of \$0.70 per million
output tokens. To cultivate LongCat-Flash towards agentic intelligence, we
conduct a large-scale pre-training on optimized mixtures, followed by targeted
mid- and post-training on reasoning, code, and instructions, with further
augmentation from synthetic data and tool use tasks. Comprehensive evaluations
demonstrate that, as a non-thinking foundation model, LongCat-Flash delivers
highly competitive performance among other leading models, with exceptional
strengths in agentic tasks. The model checkpoint of LongCat-Flash is
open-sourced to foster community research.

### [118] [Entropy-based Coarse and Compressed Semantic Speech Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00503)
*Jialong Zuo,Guangyan Zhang,Minghui Fang,Shengpeng Ji,Xiaoqi Jiao,Jingyu Li,Yiwen Guo,Zhou Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an entropy-based framework for dynamically compressing speech representations, aiming to reduce redundancy and improve efficiency while maintaining or improving performance in speech applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing speech tokenization methods encode 16 kHz waveforms at high frequency (25-50 tokens per second), leading to redundancy and focusing primarily on phonetic details rather than semantic understanding.

Method: An entropy-based dynamic aggregation framework adaptively combines speech tokens into segments using predictive entropy and a cross-attention module, balancing granularity and compression via an adjustable threshold.

Result: The compressed speech representations achieve performance comparable to or better than dense token sequences in ASR, speech-to-text translation, and voice conversion tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively reduces redundancy, improves efficiency, and retains semantic understanding, offering a better alternative to traditional dense tokenization techniques.

Abstract: Discrete speech representation learning has recently attracted increasing
interest in both acoustic and semantic modeling. Existing approaches typically
encode 16 kHz waveforms into discrete tokens at a rate of 25 or 50 tokens per
second. However, given that speech generally conveys only 2 to 5 words per
second, such fine-grained tokenization introduces redundancy and hinders
efficiency in downstream training and inference. Moreover, semantic speech
representations at this frequency primarily capture phonetic-level information,
while semantic understanding may not require such detailed token-level
resolution. To address these limitations, we propose an entropy-based dynamic
aggregation framework for learning compressed semantic speech representations.
A speech language model is first pre-trained via next-token prediction on
large-scale unlabeled data to capture frequent token patterns. Predictive
entropy is then used to adaptively determine aggregation boundaries, followed
by a cross-attention module that fuses information within each segment. By
adjusting the entropy threshold, the granularity and compression ratio of the
representations can be flexibly controlled. Experiments on ASR, speech-to-text
translation, and voice conversion tasks demonstrate that the compressed
representations perform on par with or better than dense token sequences,
demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

*Eunjung Cho,Alexander Hoyle,Yoan Hermstrüwer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates how Large Language Models (LLMs) respond to prompts tailored toward different legal roles and examines their selective output patterns, raising concerns about motivated reasoning in legal summarizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore the implications of how LLMs generate outputs conditioned on legal roles, raising concerns about the adaptability and biases in using AI for legal summarizations.

Method: The authors developed an evaluation framework focusing on the inclusion of legal facts, reasoning patterns, and favorability towards stakeholders, analyzing outputs conditioned on roles like judges, prosecutors, and attorneys.

Result: Findings reveal that LLMs exhibit selective inclusion patterns aligned with the conditioned legal roles—even under prompts suggesting balance—indicating consistent role-specific perspectives.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of role-aware evaluation to mitigate biases in LLM behavior when summarizing judicial decisions, especially in high-stakes settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate user-tailored
summaries, adapting outputs to specific stakeholders. In legal contexts, this
raises important questions about motivated reasoning -- how models
strategically frame information to align with a stakeholder's position within
the legal system. Building on theories of legal realism and recent trends in
legal practice, we investigate how LLMs respond to prompts conditioned on
different legal roles (e.g., judges, prosecutors, attorneys) when summarizing
judicial decisions. We introduce an evaluation framework grounded in legal fact
and reasoning inclusion, also considering favorability towards stakeholders.
Our results show that even when prompts include balancing instructions, models
exhibit selective inclusion patterns that reflect role-consistent perspectives.
These findings raise broader concerns about how similar alignment may emerge as
LLMs begin to infer user roles from prior interactions or context, even without
explicit role instructions. Our results underscore the need for role-aware
evaluation of LLM summarization behavior in high-stakes legal settings.

*Hanqi Yan,Hainiu Xu,Yulan He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can exhibit increased misalignment when reasoning capabilities are enhanced, raising safety concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how improved reasoning in LLMs impacts their safety and alignment, especially when responding to malicious requests.

Method: The study examines LLM behavior when using reasoning-enhanced modes or fine-tuning on benign datasets, and analyzes internal model states, including attention patterns and experts in mixture-of-experts models, to explore safety mechanisms.

Result: It was found that enhanced reasoning capabilities make LLMs more vulnerable to responding inappropriately to malicious requests, but mechanisms like attention shifts and specialized experts can mitigate risks.

Conclusion: Improved reasoning introduces a reasoning-safety trade-off, emphasizing the need for urgent advancements in aligning reasoning-capable LLMs with human values and safety standards.

Abstract: With Large Language Models (LLMs) becoming increasingly widely adopted,
concerns regarding their safety and alignment with human values have
intensified. Previous studies have shown that fine-tuning LLMs on narrow and
malicious datasets induce misaligned behaviors. In this work, we report a more
concerning phenomenon, Reasoning-Induced Misalignment. Specifically, we observe
that LLMs become more responsive to malicious requests when reasoning is
strengthened, via switching to "think-mode" or fine-tuning on benign math
datasets, with dense models particularly vulnerable. Moreover, we analyze
internal model states and find that both attention shifts and specialized
experts in mixture-of-experts models help redirect excessive reasoning towards
safety guardrails. These findings provide new insights into the emerging
reasoning-safety trade-off and underscore the urgency of advancing alignment
for advanced reasoning models.

*Lang Xiong,Nishant Bhargava,Wesley Chang,Jianhang Hong,Haihao Liu,Kevin Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies how large language models (LLMs) behave differently when shifting from evaluation settings to real-world contexts, aiming to quantify and manipulate this phenomenon, termed 'evaluation awareness.' 


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research is motivated by the discrepancy between benchmark evaluations and real-world model safety and honesty, which challenges AI alignment.

Method: They used a linear probe to score prompts on a 'test-like' to 'deploy-like' continuum and developed an LLM rewriting method to make prompts more natural while retaining the original task.

Result: Rewritten prompts yielded a 30% increase in 'deploy-like' characteristics. Models exhibited a 5.26% increase in honesty, a 12.40% decrease in deceptive responses, and a 6.38% rise in refusal rates, indicating better alignment and safety in realistic contexts.

Conclusion: Evaluation awareness significantly impacts LLM safety and behavior. The study emphasizes the need for realistic evaluation frameworks to better assess and ensure model alignment before deployment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit significant behavioral shifts when
they perceive a change from a real-world deployment context to a controlled
evaluation setting, a phenomenon known as "evaluation awareness." This
discrepancy poses a critical challenge for AI alignment, as benchmark
performance may not accurately reflect a model's true safety and honesty. In
this work, we systematically quantify these behavioral changes by manipulating
the perceived context of prompts. We introduce a methodology that uses a linear
probe to score prompts on a continuous scale from "test-like" to "deploy-like"
and leverage an LLM rewriting strategy to shift these prompts towards a more
natural, deployment-style context while preserving the original task. Using
this method, we achieved a 30% increase in the average probe score across a
strategic role-playing dataset after rewriting. Evaluating a suite of
state-of-the-art models on these original and rewritten prompts, we find that
rewritten "deploy-like" prompts induce a significant and consistent shift in
behavior. Across all models, we observed an average increase in honest
responses of 5.26% and a corresponding average decrease in deceptive responses
of 12.40%. Furthermore, refusal rates increased by an average of 6.38%,
indicating heightened safety compliance. Our findings demonstrate that
evaluation awareness is a quantifiable and manipulable factor that directly
influences LLM behavior, revealing that models are more prone to unsafe or
deceptive outputs in perceived test environments. This underscores the urgent
need for more realistic evaluation frameworks to accurately gauge true model
alignment before deployment.

*Rishiraj Acharya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The GAM network offers a faster and efficient sequence modeling alternative to Transformers by using a linear-complexity approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the quadratic computational scaling of Transformers to improve efficiency for long sequences.

Method: Introduced the GAM block with causal convolution and associative memory retrieval, fused by gating, to replace self-attention layers.

Result: GAM is faster than Transformers and other baselines, with competitive or superior performance on validation perplexity across datasets.

Conclusion: GAM is a promising linear-complexity sequence modeling architecture that balances efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: The Transformer architecture, underpinned by the self-attention mechanism,
has become the de facto standard for sequence modeling tasks. However, its core
computational primitive scales quadratically with sequence length (O(N^2)),
creating a significant bottleneck for processing long contexts. In this paper,
we propose the Gated Associative Memory (GAM) network, a novel, fully parallel
architecture for sequence modeling that exhibits linear complexity (O(N)) with
respect to sequence length. The GAM block replaces the self-attention layer
with two parallel pathways: a causal convolution to efficiently capture local,
position-dependent context, and a parallel associative memory retrieval
mechanism to model global, content-based patterns. These pathways are
dynamically fused using a gating mechanism, allowing the model to flexibly
combine local and global information for each token. We implement GAM from
scratch and conduct a rigorous comparative analysis against a standard
Transformer model and a modern linear-time baseline (Mamba) on the WikiText-2
benchmark, as well as against the Transformer on the TinyStories dataset. Our
experiments demonstrate that GAM is consistently faster, outperforming both
baselines on training speed, and achieves a superior or competitive final
validation perplexity across all datasets, establishing it as a promising and
efficient alternative for sequence modeling.

TL;DR: The study introduces the ICPC benchmark for competitive programming, evaluates language model (LM) performance, and proposes an advanced inference technique achieving a significant improvement in solve rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore competitive programming as a challenging domain for language model assessment, which has been underexplored despite requiring advanced algorithmic and coding skills.

Method: The authors developed the ICPC benchmark comprising 254 programming tasks with comprehensive resources (analysis, code, and tests) and evaluated various LM inference techniques, including zero-shot prompting and enhanced methods like self-judgment with retrieval and reflection.

Result: The baseline zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting achieved a 19.1% pass@1 solve rate, while the best proposed technique increased this to 42.2%. Human-in-the-loop experiments enabled further improvements, solving problems previously considered unsolvable.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the potential of LMs for solving complex programming tasks, highlighting the importance of guided methods and human intervention. The authors provide open-source tools to further this research. 

Abstract: Among the hardest tasks for humans are those found in competitive programming
where problems require sophisticated algorithmic thinking, puzzle solving, and
the creation of effective code. As a domain to assess language models (LMs), it
has not received enough attention, though. This study presents the ICPC
benchmark, which consists of 254 international collegiate programming contest
(ICPC) tasks. Each problem includes official analysis, reference code, and
sample, high-quality unit, and hidden tests. We are able to develop and
evaluate a variety of LM inference techniques for competitive programming with
these resources. With zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting, we find that o1
only achieves a 19.1\% pass@1 solve rate. With our best inference technique,
which combines multi-turn self-judge with reflection and retrieval over
episodic information, raises this to 42.2\%. Furthermore, we conduct a new
human-in-the-loop investigation to gain a deeper understanding of the remaining
difficulties. Surprisingly, we discover that o1 can solve 17 out of 18 problems
that were previously unsolvable by any model or technique with just a few
specific instructions. A footstep toward LMs with grounded, imaginative, and
algorithmic thinking is provided by our quantitative findings and qualitative
research. We open-source our code and data at https://github.com/kraritt/zolve.

*Sanjeeevan Selvaganapathy,Mehwish Nasim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in identifying hate speech, comparing uncensored models versus heavily safety-aligned censored models. Censored models outperform uncensored ones in accuracy but are ideologically anchored.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to analyze whether uncensored LLMs are more objective in classifying hate speech due to fewer moral guardrails compared to censored LLMs.

Method: A comparison of censored and uncensored LLMs was performed to assess their accuracy, robustness, ideological resistance, and fairness when detecting hate speech.

Result: Censored models achieved 78.7% accuracy versus 64.1% for uncensored models. However, censored models showed ideological rigidity, and all models exhibited critical failures in handling nuanced language, such as irony, and fairness disparities.

Conclusion: Censored LLMs excel in accuracy but struggle with ideological framing and fairness biases, requiring more advanced auditing frameworks to enhance their objectivity and calibration.

Abstract: We investigate the efficacy of Large Language Models (LLMs) in detecting
implicit and explicit hate speech, examining whether models with minimal safety
alignment (uncensored) might provide more objective classification capabilities
compared to their heavily-aligned (censored) counterparts. While uncensored
models theoretically offer a less constrained perspective free from moral
guardrails that could bias classification decisions, our results reveal a
surprising trade-off: censored models significantly outperform their uncensored
counterparts in both accuracy and robustness, achieving 78.7% versus 64.1%
strict accuracy. However, this enhanced performance comes with its own
limitation -- the safety alignment acts as a strong ideological anchor, making
censored models resistant to persona-based influence, while uncensored models
prove highly malleable to ideological framing. Furthermore, we identify
critical failures across all models in understanding nuanced language such as
irony. We also find alarming fairness disparities in performance across
different targeted groups and systemic overconfidence that renders
self-reported certainty unreliable. These findings challenge the notion of LLMs
as objective arbiters and highlight the need for more sophisticated auditing
frameworks that account for fairness, calibration, and ideological consistency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes 'Router Upcycling', a novel routing method that improves Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) upcycling models by initializing routers from attention heads and enabling better token-to-expert assignment. Results show state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in efficiently training Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, particularly with simple routing mechanisms like linear routers that struggle in complex tasks.

Method: The method initializes multiple routers from preceding attention layers during upcycling, where these routers collaboratively assign tokens to specialized experts in an attention-like manner.

Result: Experimental results show that 'Router Upcycling' achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing other upcycling baselines.

Conclusion: Router Upcycling provides a more effective routing mechanism, improving the efficiency and performance of MoE upcycling models, and represents a significant enhancement over existing approaches.

Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have gained significant attention in deep
learning due to their dynamic resource allocation and superior performance
across diverse tasks. However, efficiently training these models remains
challenging. The MoE upcycling technique has been proposed to reuse and improve
existing model components, thereby minimizing training overhead. Despite this,
simple routers, such as linear routers, often struggle with complex routing
tasks within MoE upcycling. In response, we propose a novel routing technique
called Router Upcycling to enhance the performance of MoE upcycling models. Our
approach initializes multiple routers from the attention heads of preceding
attention layers during upcycling. These routers collaboratively assign tokens
to specialized experts in an attention-like manner. Each token is processed
into diverse queries and aligned with the experts' features (serving as keys).
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art

### [127] [Do small language models generate realistic variable-quality fake news headlines?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00680)
*Austin McCutcheon,Chris Brogly*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the ability of Small Language Models (SLMs) to generate fake news headlines and assesses their resemblance to real-world examples, as well as the detection capabilities of current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the extent to which Small Language Models can generate fake news content and evaluate the ability of existing detection models to classify such content accurately.

Method: The study analyzed 14 SLMs by using controlled prompt engineering to generate 24,000 fake headlines and then applied established detection models like DistilBERT and bagging classifiers to assess headline quality and authenticity.

Result: The tested SLMs were highly compliant in creating fake headlines with minimal ethical resistance, but existing detection models showed poor accuracy, misclassifying headline quality with accuracies ranging from 35.2% to 63.5%.

Conclusion: SLMs can easily generate falsified headlines, but there are weak ethical safeguards in place, and their outputs are not reliably distinguishable by current detection systems, indicating improvement areas for both SLM design and detection technology.

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) have the capability for text generation and may
potentially be used to generate falsified texts online. This study evaluates 14
SLMs (1.7B-14B parameters) including LLaMA, Gemma, Phi, SmolLM, Mistral, and
Granite families in generating perceived low and high quality fake news
headlines when explicitly prompted, and whether they appear to be similar to
real-world news headlines. Using controlled prompt engineering, 24,000
headlines were generated across low-quality and high-quality deceptive
categories. Existing machine learning and deep learning-based news headline
quality detectors were then applied against these SLM-generated fake news
headlines. SLMs demonstrated high compliance rates with minimal ethical
resistance, though there were some occasional exceptions. Headline quality
detection using established DistilBERT and bagging classifier models showed
that quality misclassification was common, with detection accuracies only
ranging from 35.2% to 63.5%. These findings suggest the following: tested SLMs
generally are compliant in generating falsified headlines, although there are
slight variations in ethical restraints, and the generated headlines did not
closely resemble existing primarily human-written content on the web, given the
low quality classification accuracy.

### [128] [Text Reinforcement for Multimodal Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00687)
*Chen Su,Yuanhe Tian,Yan Song,Yongdong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a text reinforcement model (TeR) to enhance textual content in multimodal time series forecasting (TSF), improving forecasting performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal TSF models often rely on high-quality textual and time series inputs, but texts may inadequately capture the nuances of historical time series data, leading to unstable performance.

Method: The paper introduces a text reinforcement model (TeR) and utilizes reinforcement learning to optimize the generation of high-quality, task-relevant reinforced text, improving multimodal TSF performance.

Result: Experiments on a benchmark dataset show that the proposed method outperforms strong baselines and existing studies across various domains.

Conclusion: Reinforcing the text modality in multimodal TSF significantly enhances forecasting performance, demonstrating the utility of the TeR model and its reinforcement learning framework.

Abstract: Recent studies in time series forecasting (TSF) use multimodal inputs, such
as text and historical time series data, to predict future values. These
studies mainly focus on developing advanced techniques to integrate textual
information with time series data to perform the task and achieve promising
results. Meanwhile, these approaches rely on high-quality text and time series
inputs, whereas in some cases, the text does not accurately or fully capture
the information carried by the historical time series, which leads to unstable
performance in multimodal TSF. Therefore, it is necessary to enhance the
textual content to improve the performance of multimodal TSF. In this paper, we
propose improving multimodal TSF by reinforcing the text modalities. We propose
a text reinforcement model (TeR) to generate reinforced text that addresses
potential weaknesses in the original text, then apply this reinforced text to
support the multimodal TSF model's understanding of the time series, improving
TSF performance. To guide the TeR toward producing higher-quality reinforced
text, we design a reinforcement learning approach that assigns rewards based on
the impact of each reinforced text on the performance of the multimodal TSF
model and its relevance to the TSF task. We optimize the TeR accordingly, so as
to improve the quality of the generated reinforced text and enhance TSF
performance. Extensive experiments on a real-world benchmark dataset covering
various domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which
outperforms strong baselines and existing studies on the dataset.

*Alex Gulko,Yusen Peng,Sachin Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces "CE-Bench," a new lightweight benchmark for assessing the interpretability of sparse autoencoders used in analyzing large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse autoencoders are useful for uncovering interpretable features in LLMs, but their development and adoption are hindered by the absence of automated evaluation methods.

Method: The authors created CE-Bench, which is a contrastive evaluation benchmark based on a curated dataset of contrastive story pairs, and validated it through thorough ablation studies.

Result: CE-Bench was found to reliably measure the interpretability of sparse autoencoders, aligning well with existing benchmarks, all without the necessity of using an external LLM.

Conclusion: CE-Bench offers a reliable and automated method for evaluating sparse autoencoders, and its implementation and dataset have been open-sourced for the research community.

Abstract: Probing with sparse autoencoders is a promising approach for uncovering
interpretable features in large language models (LLMs). However, the lack of
automated evaluation methods has hindered their broader adoption and
development. In this work, we introduce CE-Bench, a novel and lightweight
contrastive evaluation benchmark for sparse autoencoders, built on a curated
dataset of contrastive story pairs. We conduct comprehensive ablation studies
to validate the effectiveness of our approach. Our results show that CE-Bench
reliably measures the interpretability of sparse autoencoders and aligns well
with existing benchmarks, all without requiring an external LLM. The official
implementation and evaluation dataset are open-sourced under the MIT License.

### [130] [Learning to Shop Like Humans: A Review-driven Retrieval-Augmented Recommendation Framework with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00698)
*Kaiwen Wei,Jinpeng Gao,Jiang Zhong,Yuming Yang,Fengmao Lv,Zhenyang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces RevBrowse, a framework that enhances recommendations using user reviews, addressing limitations in existing LLM-based approaches through a retrieval-augmented module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based recommendation systems face challenges in efficiently using user reviews due to constrained context windows and lack of mechanisms to prioritize relevant reviews for user decisions.

Method: A framework, RevBrowse, is proposed with a retrieval-augmented module (PrefRAG) that structures user-item representations and retrieves relevant review content to improve the recommendation process.

Result: Extensive tests on four Amazon review datasets show RevBrowse consistently outperforms baseline methods, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalizability.

Conclusion: RevBrowse efficiently leverages user reviews in LLM-driven recommendation tasks, improving performance and providing interpretability through review influence transparency.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong potential in recommendation
tasks due to their strengths in language understanding, reasoning and knowledge
integration. These capabilities are especially beneficial for review-based
recommendation, which relies on semantically rich user-generated texts to
reveal fine-grained user preferences and item attributes. However, effectively
incorporating reviews into LLM-based recommendation remains challenging due to
(1) inefficient to dynamically utilize user reviews under LLMs' constrained
context windows, and (2) lacking effective mechanisms to prioritize reviews
most relevant to the user's current decision context. To address these
challenges, we propose RevBrowse, a review-driven recommendation framework
inspired by the "browse-then-decide" decision process commonly observed in
online user behavior. RevBrowse integrates user reviews into the LLM-based
reranking process to enhance its ability to distinguish between candidate
items. To improve the relevance and efficiency of review usage, we introduce
PrefRAG, a retrieval-augmented module that disentangles user and item
representations into structured forms and adaptively retrieves
preference-relevant content conditioned on the target item. Extensive
experiments on four Amazon review datasets demonstrate that RevBrowse achieves
consistent and significant improvements over strong baselines, highlighting its
generalizability and effectiveness in modeling dynamic user preferences.
Furthermore, since the retrieval-augmented process is transparent, RevBrowse
offers a certain level of interpretability by making visible which reviews
influence the final recommendation.

### [131] [Reward-Weighted Sampling: Enhancing Non-Autoregressive Characteristics in Masked Diffusion LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00707)
*Daehoon Gwak,Minseo Jung,Junwoo Park,Minho Park,ChaeHun Park,Junha Hyung,Jaegul Choo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes Reward-Weighted Sampling (RWS), a new decoding strategy to improve non-autoregressive generation in Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs). RWS uses global sequence-level evaluation to enhance token selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Masked Diffusion Models aim to provide a non-autoregressive alternative for language modeling, but standard decoding methods often mirror autoregressive generation orders, undermining their advantages.

Method: Reward-Weighted Sampling evaluates entire intermediate sequences using an external reward model, scaling token logits to promote global sequence-level coherence and non-autoregressive generation orders.

Result: RWS shows theoretical benefits in improving token selection and expected rewards while experiments demonstrate enhanced non-autoregressive properties and overall language model performance.

Conclusion: Integrating global signals via RWS effectively improves Masked Diffusion Models and enhances non-autoregressive decoding strategies for better performance.

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) offer a promising non-autoregressive
alternative for large language modeling. Standard decoding methods for MDMs,
such as confidence-based sampling, select tokens independently based on
individual token confidences at each diffusion step. However, we observe that
this independent token selection often results in generation orders resembling
sequential autoregressive processes, limiting the advantages of
non-autoregressive modeling. To mitigate this pheonomenon, we propose
Reward-Weighted Sampling (RWS), a novel decoding strategy that leverages an
external reward model to provide a principled global signal during the
iterative diffusion process. Specifically, at each diffusion step, RWS
evaluates the quality of the entire intermediate sequence and scales token
logits accordingly, guiding token selection by integrating global
sequence-level coherence. This method selectively increases the confidence of
tokens that initially have lower scores, thereby promoting a more
non-autoregressive generation order. Furthermore, we provide theoretical
justification showing that reward-weighted logit scaling induces beneficial
rank reversals in token selection and consistently improves expected reward.
Experiments demonstrate that RWS significantly promotes non-autoregressive
generation orders, leading to improvements across multiple evaluation metrics.
These results highlight the effectiveness of integrating global signals in
enhancing both the non-autoregressive properties and overall performance of
MDMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study presents a five-phase framework for creating an AI-powered Learning Management System (AI-LMS) that integrates generative and conversational AI to enhance personalized and scalable learning experiences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in higher education like personalized learning and scalability with a pedagogically coherent approach using AI.

Method: Employs a design-based research methodology encompassing literature review, SWOT analysis, principle development, system design, and strategy formulation.

Result: Introduces an AI-LMS framework with modular features, such as configurable prompts and adaptive feedback loops, grounded in established learning theories.

Conclusion: Combines AI capabilities, human-centered design, and ethical considerations to propose a feasible way to integrate AI into education, with plans for future validation through real-world application.

Abstract: Higher education faces growing challenges in delivering personalized,
scalable, and pedagogically coherent learning experiences. This study
introduces a structured framework for designing an AI-powered Learning
Management System (AI-LMS) that integrates generative and conversational AI to
support adaptive, interactive, and learner-centered instruction. Using a
design-based research (DBR) methodology, the framework unfolds through five
phases: literature review, SWOT analysis, development of ethical-pedagogical
principles, system design, and instructional strategy formulation. The
resulting AI-LMS features modular components -- including configurable prompts,
adaptive feedback loops, and multi-agent conversation flows -- aligned with
pedagogical paradigms such as behaviorist, constructivist, and connectivist
learning theories. By combining AI capabilities with human-centered design and
ethical safeguards, this study advances a practical model for AI integration in
education. Future research will validate and refine the system through
real-world implementation.

*Houji Jin,Negin Ashrafi,Armin Abdollahi,Wei Liu,Jian Wang,Ganyu Gui,Maryam Pishgar,Huanghao Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates AI-generated text detection methods in Chinese using various models, finding LoRA-adapted Qwen2.5-7B to be the most effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of detecting AI-generated Chinese text, which is difficult due to its linguistic nuances.

Method: Comparison of encoder-based transformers, a LoRA-adapted decoder-only model, and a FastText baseline using a masked language modeling approach and lightweight fine-tuning.

Result: LoRA-adapted Qwen2.5-7B outperforms others with 95.94% test accuracy, while encoder models and FastText show limitations in robustness and semantic understanding.

Conclusion: Decoder-based LLMs with parameter-efficient fine-tuning, like Qwen2.5-7B, offer robust solutions for AI-text detection. Future research will focus on improving cross-domain robustness.

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) has heightened the demand
for accurate detection of AI-generated text, particularly in languages like
Chinese, where subtle linguistic nuances pose significant challenges to current
methods. In this study, we conduct a systematic comparison of encoder-based
Transformers (Chinese BERT-large and RoBERTa-wwm-ext-large), a decoder-only LLM
(Alibaba's Qwen2.5-7B/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B fine-tuned via Low-Rank
Adaptation, LoRA), and a FastText baseline using the publicly available dataset
from the NLPCC 2025 Chinese AI-Generated Text Detection Task. Encoder models
were fine-tuned using a novel prompt-based masked language modeling approach,
while Qwen2.5-7B was adapted for classification with an instruction-format
input and a lightweight classification head trained via LoRA. Experiments
reveal that although encoder models nearly memorize training data, they suffer
significant performance degradation under distribution shifts (RoBERTa: 76.3%
test accuracy; BERT: 79.3%). FastText demonstrates surprising lexical
robustness (83.5% accuracy) yet lacks deeper semantic understanding. In
contrast, the LoRA-adapted Qwen2.5-7B achieves 95.94% test accuracy with
balanced precision-recall metrics, indicating superior generalization and
resilience to dataset-specific artifacts. These findings underscore the
efficacy of decoder-based LLMs with parameter-efficient fine-tuning for robust
Chinese AI-generated text detection. Future work will explore next-generation
Qwen3 models, distilled variants, and ensemble strategies to enhance
cross-domain robustness further.

*Zhichao Yan,Jiaoyan Chen,Jiapu Wang,Xiaoli Li,Ru Li,Jeff Z. Pan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces FIDES, a framework for improving question decomposition and evidence aggregation in QA with LLMs, addressing irrelevance and incompleteness in state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current question decomposition methods in QA often yield irrelevant and incomplete results, losing factual accuracy during retrieval and failing to aggregate evidence effectively.

Method: FIDES employs a two-stage contextually enhanced decomposition technique to break down answers into sub-facts, improving retrieval and allowing for adjustments when conflicts arise. Retrieved snippets are aggregated faithfully.

Result: FIDES shows an over 14% average performance improvement over existing methods across six datasets and is evaluated using a novel metric, $Attr_{auto-P}$.

Conclusion: FIDES enhances attribution accuracy in QA by generating better sub-facts and aggregating evidence effectively, providing substantial improvements in performance.

Abstract: Attribution is crucial in question answering (QA) with Large Language Models
(LLMs).SOTA question decomposition-based approaches use long form answers to
generate questions for retrieving related documents. However, the generated
questions are often irrelevant and incomplete, resulting in a loss of facts in
retrieval.These approaches also fail to aggregate evidence snippets from
different documents and paragraphs. To tackle these problems, we propose a new
fact decomposition-based framework called FIDES (\textit{faithful context
enhanced fact decomposition and evidence aggregation}) for attributed QA. FIDES
uses a contextually enhanced two-stage faithful decomposition method to
decompose long form answers into sub-facts, which are then used by a retriever
to retrieve related evidence snippets. If the retrieved evidence snippets
conflict with the related sub-facts, such sub-facts will be revised
accordingly. Finally, the evidence snippets are aggregated according to the
original sentences.Extensive evaluation has been conducted with six datasets,
with an additionally proposed new metric called $Attr_{auto-P}$ for evaluating
the evidence precision. FIDES outperforms the SOTA methods by over 14\% in
average with GPT-3.5-turbo, Gemini and Llama 70B series.

*Weizhe Shi,Qiqi Wang,Yihong Pan,Qian Liu,Kaiqi Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new task, Judicial Opinion Generation, to automate producing legal reasoning and sentencing decisions simultaneously using a framework called LegalChainReasoner.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods use isolated approaches to handle legal reasoning and sentencing prediction, leading to inconsistencies and challenges in practical deployment.

Method: The paper proposes LegalChainReasoner, a framework employing structured legal chains to integrate factual data, legal conditions, and sentencing for end-to-end generation.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets show the proposed method outperforms existing baseline models.

Conclusion: The proposed method improves the consistency and practical application of judicial opinion generation, aligning better with real-world judicial needs.

Abstract: A criminal judicial opinion represents the judge's disposition of a case,
including the decision rationale and sentencing. Automatically generating such
opinions can assist in analyzing sentencing consistency and provide judges with
references to similar past cases. However, current research typically
approaches this task by dividing it into two isolated subtasks: legal reasoning
and sentencing prediction. This separation often leads to inconsistency between
the reasoning and predictions, failing to meet real-world judicial
requirements. Furthermore, prior studies rely on manually curated knowledge to
enhance applicability, yet such methods remain limited in practical deployment.
To address these limitations and better align with legal practice, we propose a
new LegalAI task: Judicial Opinion Generation, which simultaneously produces
both legal reasoning and sentencing decisions. To achieve this, we introduce
LegalChainReasoner, a framework that applies structured legal chains to guide
the model through comprehensive case assessments. By integrating factual
premises, composite legal conditions, and sentencing conclusions, our approach
ensures flexible knowledge injection and end-to-end opinion generation.
Experiments on two real-world and open-source Chinese legal case datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) for multi-hop biomedical question answering, identifying the gap between semantic understanding and exact answer accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to rigorously evaluate the capabilities of large language models in handling complex biomedical question answering before deploying them in healthcare applications.

Method: They fine-tune LLaMA 38B using curated biomedical datasets and experiment with three setups for answer tuning, while introducing a two-stage inference pipeline for accurate short-answer extraction.

Result: The models achieve strong domain understanding with concept-level accuracy scores of up to 0.8 but struggle with Exact Match (EM) scores during testing owing to challenges like verbosity.

Conclusion: Despite advancements in semantic understanding, exact answer generation remains insufficiently addressed, necessitating further research in output control and post-processing for biomedical LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evident for accurate question
answering across various domains. However, rigorous evaluation of their
performance on complex question-answering (QA) capabilities is essential before
deployment in real-world biomedical and healthcare applications. This paper
presents our approach to the MedHopQA track of the BioCreative IX shared task,
which focuses on multi-hop biomedical question answering involving diseases,
genes, and chemicals. We adopt a supervised fine-tuning strategy leveraging
LLaMA 3 8B, enhanced with a curated biomedical question-answer dataset compiled
from external sources including BioASQ, MedQuAD, and TREC. Three experimental
setups are explored: fine-tuning on combined short and long answers, short
answers only, and long answers only. While our models demonstrate strong domain
understanding, achieving concept-level accuracy scores of up to 0.8, their
Exact Match (EM) scores remain significantly lower, particularly in the test
phase. We introduce a two-stage inference pipeline for precise short-answer
extraction to mitigate verbosity and improve alignment with evaluation metrics.
Despite partial improvements, challenges persist in generating strictly
formatted outputs. Our findings highlight the gap between semantic
understanding and exact answer evaluation in biomedical LLM applications,
motivating further research in output control and post-processing strategies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Topic Model Translation (TMT), a method for transferring topic models across languages without requiring metadata, embeddings, or aligned corpora.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for training topic models in a multilingual environment face challenges due to limited data, lack of developer knowledge of the target language, and difficulties in acquiring topic-aligned corpora.

Method: Developed Topic Model Translation (TMT), a technique that transfers topic models like LDA between languages without metadata, embeddings, or reliance on aligned corpora.

Result: Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations show TMT produces semantically coherent and consistent translations of topics across languages.

Conclusion: TMT effectively enables reuse of topic models in data-sparse multilingual scenarios, offering a robust solution where aligned corpora or manual translations are unavailable.

Abstract: The training of topic models for a multilingual environment is a challenging
task, requiring the use of sophisticated algorithms, topic-aligned corpora, and
manual evaluation. These difficulties are further exacerbated when the
developer lacks knowledge of the target language or is working in an
environment with limited data, where only small or unusable multilingual
corpora are available.
  Considering these challenges, we introduce Topic Model Translation (TMT), a
novel, robust and transparent technique designed to transfer topic models
(e.g., Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) based topic models) from one language
to another, without the need for metadata, embeddings, or aligned corpora. TMT
enables the reuse of topic models across languages, making it especially
suitable for scenarios where large corpora in the target language are
unavailable or manual translation is infeasible. Furthermore, we evaluate TMT
extensively using both quantitative and qualitative methods, demonstrating that
it produces semantically coherent and consistent topic translations.

### [138] [Top-H Decoding: Adapting the Creativity and Coherence with Bounded Entropy in Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02510)
*Erfan Baghaei Potraghloo,Seyedarmin Azizi,Souvik Kundu,Massoud Pedram*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces top-H decoding, a new sampling method for open-ended text generation that outperforms current methods in balancing creativity and logical coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) struggle to balance creativity and coherence in text generation, and existing sampling techniques inadequately incorporate the model's confidence.

Method: The authors propose a new decoding method called top-H, based on solving an entropy-constrained mass maximization problem, which optimizes the trade-off between creativity and coherence.

Result: Extensive evaluations show that top-H decoding achieves up to 25.63% improvement on creative writing tasks compared to min-p sampling, while maintaining strong performance in question-answering benchmarks.

Conclusion: Top-H decoding sets a new state-of-the-art for open-ended text generation, demonstrating superior creativity and coherence, and can be effectively applied to creative writing tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite their impressive performance across a
wide range of tasks, often struggle to balance two competing objectives in
open-ended text generation: fostering diversity and creativity while preserving
logical coherence. Existing truncated sampling techniques, including
temperature scaling, top-\$p\$ (nucleus) sampling, and min-\$p\$ sampling, aim
to manage this trade-off. However, they exhibit limitations, particularly in
the effective incorporation of the confidence of the model into the
corresponding sampling strategy. For example, min-\$p\$ sampling relies on a
single top token as a heuristic for confidence, eventually underutilizing the
information of the probability distribution. Toward effective incorporation of
the confidence of the model, in this paper, we present **top-H** decoding. We
first establish the theoretical foundation of the interplay between creativity
and coherence in truncated sampling by formulating an **entropy-constrained
minimum divergence** problem. We then prove this minimization problem to be
equivalent to an **entropy-constrained mass maximization** (ECMM) problem,
which is NP-hard. Finally, we present top-H decoding, a computationally
efficient greedy algorithm to solve the ECMM problem. Extensive empirical
evaluations demonstrate that top-H outperforms the state-of-the-art (SoTA)
alternative of min-\$p\$ sampling by up to **25.63%** on creative writing
benchmarks, while maintaining robustness on question-answering datasets such as
GPQA, GSM8K, and MT-Bench. Additionally, an *LLM-as-judge* evaluation confirms
that top-H indeed produces coherent outputs even at higher temperatures, where
creativity is especially critical. In summary, top-H advances SoTA in
open-ended text generation and can be *easily integrated* into creative writing
applications. The code is available at
https://github.com/ErfanBaghaei/Top-H-Decoding.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses evaluation challenges for generative AI-based dialogue systems in DSTC-12, using both LM prompting and encoder-based models to predict dimension-specific scores. LM prompting performed modestly, while encoder models excelled in validation but underperformed on test due to dataset score range differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop effective evaluation methods for generative AI-based dialogue systems under constraints of using relatively small models.

Method: The methods include prompting language models as evaluators and training encoder-based classification and regression models to predict dialogue-level scores.

Result: LM prompting achieved modest correlation with human judgment and ranked second in performance on the test set. Encoder-based models showed high correlations in validation but struggled on the test set due to differing score ranges in annotations.

Conclusion: Under constraints of model size, combining LM prompting and encoder-based approaches offers potential for improving dialogue system evaluation, though performance variations across datasets must be addressed.

Abstract: The growing number of generative AI-based dialogue systems has made their
evaluation a crucial challenge. This paper presents our contribution to this
important problem through the Dialogue System Technology Challenge (DSTC-12,
Track 1), where we developed models to predict dialogue-level,
dimension-specific scores. Given the constraint of using relatively small
models (i.e. fewer than 13 billion parameters) our work follows two main
strategies: employing Language Models (LMs) as evaluators through prompting,
and training encoder-based classification and regression models.
  Our results show that while LM prompting achieves only modest correlations
with human judgments, it still ranks second on the test set, outperformed only
by the baseline. The regression and classification models, with significantly
fewer parameters, demonstrate high correlation for some dimensions on the
validation set. Although their performance decreases on the test set, it is
important to note that the test set contains annotations with significantly
different score ranges for some of the dimensions with respect to the train and
validation sets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Multi-Granularity Hard-negative synthesis framework and an Anchor Token Aware pooling method to improve text embedding models' semantic learning capabilities using large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance text embedding model performance by improving how semantic distinctions are learned and encoded into vector representations.

Method: They use Multi-Granularity Hard-negative synthesis for generating diverse negative samples and propose Anchor Token Aware pooling to enhance token weighting during training.

Result: The proposed methods achieve state-of-the-art performance on the MTEB benchmark, outperforming existing synthesis strategies.

Conclusion: The new strategies effectively advance the quality of text embeddings, showing that large language models can be leveraged for better semantic representation learning and pooling techniques.

Abstract: Text embedding models are essential for various natural language processing
tasks, enabling the effective encoding of semantic information into dense
vector representations. These models are typically optimized using triplets of
(query, positive, negative) data pairs for contrastive learning, where the
negative samples play a critical role in enhancing the model's ability to
discern subtle semantic distinctions. In this work, we introduce a
Multi-Granularity Hard-negative (MGH) synthesis framework that leverages large
language models (LLMs) to generate diverse negative samples with varying levels
of similarity with the query. This approach facilitates a coarse-to-fine
curriculum learning strategy during supervised training, allowing the embedding
model to progressively learn more nuanced semantic representations. Meanwhile,
we propose an Anchor Token Aware (ATA) pooling method that assigns higher
weights to anchor tokens based on aggregation patterns observed in LLMs,
improving text embedding accuracy without increasing model complexity.
Comprehensive experiments on the MTEB benchmark demonstrate that our methods
achieve state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing synthesis strategies
both with synthetic data and when combined with public retrieval datasets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates societal bias in Text-to-Image (TTI) models, focusing on occupational portrayals and the models' responsiveness to fairness-aware prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the amplification of harmful societal biases in TTI models and assess their demographic fairness.

Method: Five models (closed-source and open-source) are evaluated using neutral and fairness-aware prompts. Outputs are annotated for gender and race to analyze demographic diversity shifts.

Result: Results show varying responsiveness across models: some diversify demographic outputs, others overcorrect or show minimal change.

Conclusion: Prompting can influence bias but has limitations, requiring complementary interventions at the model-level. Transparency is prioritized through released code and data.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (TTI) models are powerful creative tools but risk amplifying
harmful social biases. We frame representational societal bias assessment as an
image curation and evaluation task and introduce a pilot benchmark of
occupational portrayals spanning five socially salient roles (CEO, Nurse,
Software Engineer, Teacher, Athlete). Using five state-of-the-art models:
closed-source (DALLE 3, Gemini Imagen 4.0) and open-source (FLUX.1-dev, Stable
Diffusion XL Turbo, Grok-2 Image), we compare neutral baseline prompts against
fairness-aware controlled prompts designed to encourage demographic diversity.
All outputs are annotated for gender (male, female) and race (Asian, Black,
White), enabling structured distributional analysis. Results show that
prompting can substantially shift demographic representations, but with highly
model-specific effects: some systems diversify effectively, others overcorrect
into unrealistic uniformity, and some show little responsiveness. These
findings highlight both the promise and the limitations of prompting as a
fairness intervention, underscoring the need for complementary model-level
strategies. We release all code and data for transparency and reproducibility

### [142] [Exploring and Mitigating Fawning Hallucinations in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00869)
*Zixuan Shangguan,Yanjie Dong,Lanjun Wang,Xiaoyi Fan,Victor C. M. Leung,Xiping Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses how large language models (LLMs) can produce deceptive outputs when aligning too closely with misleading prompts, termed 'fawning hallucinations.' It introduces a decoding method to mitigate this issue and improve response accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often generate responses that align with the input's perspective rather than prioritizing accuracy, leading to potential misinformation. Addressing this issue enhances the reliability of AI output.

Method: The study introduces Collaborative Contrastive Decoding (CCD), a technique that contrasts induced deceptive inputs against more neutral transformations to reduce reliance on misleading information, without additional model training.

Result: Extensive experiments showed that CCD effectively mitigates fawning hallucinations across various tasks and improves the factual accuracy of LLM-generated responses.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that CCD is a promising solution for handling deceptive and misleading prompts in LLMs, enhancing their capability to generate factually accurate responses without retraining the models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional proficiency in
language understanding. However, when LLMs align their outputs with deceptive
and/or misleading prompts, the generated responses could deviate from the de
facto information. Such observations are known as fawning hallucinations, where
the model prioritizes alignment with the input's implied perspective over
accuracy and truthfulness. In this work, we analyze fawning hallucinations in
various natural language processing tasks and tailor the so-termed contrastive
decoding method for fawning-hallucination mitigation. Specifically, we design
two paradigms to generate corresponding deceptive and/or misleading inputs for
the consistent fawning hallucinations induction. Then, we propose the
collaborative contrastive decoding (CCD) to handle the fawning hallucinations
across different tasks in LLMs. By contrasting the deviation in output
distribution between induced and transformed neutral inputs, the proposed CCD
can reduce reliance on deceptive and/or misleading information without
requiring additional training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed CCD can effectively mitigate fawning hallucinations and improve the
factuality of the generated responses over various tasks.

### [143] [EviNote-RAG: Enhancing RAG Models via Answer-Supportive Evidence Notes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00877)
*Yuqin Dai,Guoqing Wang,Yuan Wang,Kairan Dou,Kaichen Zhou,Zhanwei Zhang,Shuo Yang,Fei Tang,Jun Yin,Pengyu Zeng,Zhenzhe Ying,Can Yi,Changhua Meng,Yuchen Zhou,Yongliang Shen,Shuai Lu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EviNote-RAG is a new retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that uses a structured retrieve-note-answer approach to improve the accuracy and robustness of open-domain question answering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitations of low signal-to-noise ratio in retrieved evidence and error accumulation in multi-hop reasoning in traditional open-domain QA frameworks.

Method: EviNote-RAG introduces a structured pipeline where the model produces Supportive-Evidence Notes (SENs), focusing on answer-relevant information while highlighting uncertainties, reinforced by an Evidence Quality Reward (EQR) for logical consistency.

Result: EviNote-RAG outperforms traditional models in both in-domain and out-of-domain QA benchmarks with significant F1 gains, achieving state-of-the-art results while improving robustness and efficiency.

Conclusion: The structured retrieve-note-answer approach coupled with evidence quality reinforcement enables EviNote-RAG to achieve more accurate, generalizable, and stable open-domain QA performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) empowered with retrieval mechanisms have
achieved strong progress in open-domain question answering (QA). Yet, the
conventional retrieve--then--answer paradigm often suffers from two key
limitations: (1) low signal-to-noise ratio in retrieved evidence, where useful
information is buried under irrelevant content, and (2) error accumulation in
multi-hop reasoning when incomplete or noisy passages are involved. To address
these challenges, we present EviNote-RAG, an agentic RAG framework that
introduces a structured retrieve--note--answer pipeline. Instead of directly
reasoning over raw retrievals, the model is trained to compose
Supportive-Evidence Notes (SENs), concise, human-like notes that preserve only
answer-relevant information, highlight uncertainty, and explicitly state when
no useful evidence exists. This distillation process is further reinforced by
the Evidence Quality Reward (EQR), an entailment-based signal that evaluates
whether SENs logically support the final answer. Together, SENs and EQR guide
the model toward faithful and robust reasoning, while reducing the impact of
noise. Experiments on in-domain and out-of-domain QA benchmarks show that
EviNote-RAG consistently outperforms strong baselines in accuracy,
generalization, and training stability. In particular, it achieves
state-of-the-art results while enhancing robustness and efficiency, yielding
relative F1 gains of 20\% on HotpotQA (+0.093), 40\% on Bamboogle (+0.151), and
91\% on 2Wiki (+0.256) via denser rewards and reduced verbosity.

*Răzvan-Alexandru Smădu,Andreea Iuga,Dumitru-Clementin Cercel,Florin Pop*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SeLeRoSa, the first-ever sentence-level Romanian satire detection dataset, highlighting current model limitations in this task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of distinguishing satire from factual content in news reporting, particularly at a granular sentence level, where misinterpretation can occur.

Method: The authors created SeLeRoSa, a dataset of 13,873 manually annotated sentences across diverse topics, and used various LLMs and transformer-based models to evaluate satire detection in zero-shot and fine-tuning approaches.

Result: The analysis showed that current models face significant limitations in accurately performing sentence-level satire detection, despite advancements in LLMs.

Conclusion: The findings underscore the need for further exploration and improvement in satire detection, especially with the integration of LLMs, to enhance their performance in nuanced tasks like this one.

Abstract: Satire, irony, and sarcasm are techniques typically used to express humor and
critique, rather than deceive; however, they can occasionally be mistaken for
factual reporting, akin to fake news. These techniques can be applied at a more
granular level, allowing satirical information to be incorporated into news
articles. In this paper, we introduce the first sentence-level dataset for
Romanian satire detection for news articles, called SeLeRoSa. The dataset
comprises 13,873 manually annotated sentences spanning various domains,
including social issues, IT, science, and movies. With the rise and recent
progress of large language models (LLMs) in the natural language processing
literature, LLMs have demonstrated enhanced capabilities to tackle various
tasks in zero-shot settings. We evaluate multiple baseline models based on LLMs
in both zero-shot and fine-tuning settings, as well as baseline
transformer-based models. Our findings reveal the current limitations of these
models in the sentence-level satire detection task, paving the way for new
research directions.

### [145] [Supervised In-Context Fine-Tuning for Generative Sequence Labeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00921)
*David Dukić,Goran Glavaš,Jan Šnajder*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SIFT (Supervised In-Context Fine-Tuning) for generative sequence labeling (SL), demonstrating its efficacy over previous methods in various SL tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sequence labeling tasks are prevalent in NLP and traditionally tackled with encoder models. The authors aim to explore the potential of leveraging causal language models (LLMs) for generative SL due to their recent advancements and scalability.

Method: The authors propose SIFT, which combines in-context learning (ICL) from task demonstrations with supervised fine-tuning. This approach frames SL tasks as constrained response generative tasks, aligning with the inherent advantages of LLMs.

Result: SIFT outperforms ICL and decoder-as-encoder fine-tuning approaches on standard SL benchmarks. Mitigation strategies, like removing instructions, were found to further improve performance in long-context settings.

Conclusion: SIFT highlights the feasibility of using generative approaches for SL tasks with LLMs, addressing limitations like instruction-based performance drops and showing strong advantages over traditional methods.

Abstract: Sequence labeling (SL) tasks, where labels are assigned to tokens, are
abundant in NLP (e.g., named entity recognition and aspect-based sentiment
analysis). Owing to the intuition that they require bidirectional context, SL
tasks are commonly tackled with encoder-only models. Recent work also shows
that removing the causal mask in fine-tuning enables decoder-based LLMs to
become effective token classifiers. Less work, however, focused on (supervised)
generative SL, a more natural setting for causal LLMs. Due to their rapid
scaling, causal LLMs applied to SL are expected to outperform encoders, whose
own development has stagnated. In this work, we propose supervised in-context
fine-tuning (SIFT) for generative SL. SIFT casts SL tasks as constrained
response generation, natural to LLMs, combining (1) in-context learning (ICL)
from demonstrations with (2) supervised fine-tuning. SIFT considerably
outperforms both ICL and decoder-as-encoder fine-tuning baselines on a range of
standard SL tasks. We further find that although long context hinders the
performance of generative SL in both ICL and SIFT, this deficiency can be
mitigated by removing the instruction, as instructions are shown to be largely
unnecessary for achieving strong SL performance with SIFT. Our findings
highlight strengths and limitations of SL with LLMs, underscoring the
importance of a response-based generative task formulation for effective SL
performance.

*Md Shahidul Salim,Lian Fu,Arav Adikesh Ramakrishnan,Zonghai Yao,Hong Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MedCOD improves English-to-Spanish medical translation by combining structured medical knowledge and advanced LLM techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of improving domain-specific English-to-Spanish medical translations by leveraging structured medical knowledge with LLMs.

Method: MedCOD integrates structured knowledge from UMLS and LLM-KB, employs structured prompting, and applies LoRA-based fine-tuning to enhance medical translation.

Result: MedCOD outperforms baseline models like GPT-4o, achieving better BLEU, chrF++, and COMET scores across evaluated LLMs.

Conclusion: Structured knowledge integration, through MedCOD, significantly enhances medical translation quality, offering a promising approach for domain-specific tasks.

Abstract: We present MedCOD (Medical Chain-of-Dictionary), a hybrid framework designed
to improve English-to-Spanish medical translation by integrating
domain-specific structured knowledge into large language models (LLMs). MedCOD
integrates domain-specific knowledge from both the Unified Medical Language
System (UMLS) and the LLM-as-Knowledge-Base (LLM-KB) paradigm to enhance
structured prompting and fine-tuning. We constructed a parallel corpus of 2,999
English-Spanish MedlinePlus articles and a 100-sentence test set annotated with
structured medical contexts. Four open-source LLMs (Phi-4, Qwen2.5-14B,
Qwen2.5-7B, and LLaMA-3.1-8B) were evaluated using structured prompts that
incorporated multilingual variants, medical synonyms, and UMLS-derived
definitions, combined with LoRA-based fine-tuning. Experimental results
demonstrate that MedCOD significantly improves translation quality across all
models. For example, Phi-4 with MedCOD and fine-tuning achieved BLEU 44.23,
chrF++ 28.91, and COMET 0.863, surpassing strong baseline models like GPT-4o
and GPT-4o-mini. Ablation studies confirm that both MedCOD prompting and model
adaptation independently contribute to performance gains, with their
combination yielding the highest improvements. These findings highlight the
potential of structured knowledge integration to enhance LLMs for medical
translation tasks.

*Yihong Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores connections between structured (knowledge graphs) and unstructured paradigms (large language models) in NLP, proposing a new approach combining their strengths for creating general knowledge engines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between structured and unstructured paradigms in natural language processing and develop systems that are transparent, controllable, and adaptable.

Method: The paper identifies and leverages conceptual connections between structure (symbolic interactions) and destructure (embedding resets) and synthesizes them into a unified framework for knowledge engine development.

Result: The study finds that combining structured and unstructured approaches enhances model plasticity, generalization to unseen scenarios, and overall functionality of knowledge engines.

Conclusion: The integration of structured and unstructured paradigms creates a more robust foundation for general knowledge engines, benefiting the development of intelligent, adaptable systems.

Abstract: The making of knowledge engines in natural language processing has been
shaped by two seemingly distinct paradigms: one grounded in structure, the
other driven by massively available unstructured data. The structured paradigm
leverages predefined symbolic interactions, such as knowledge graphs, as priors
and designs models to capture them. In contrast, the unstructured paradigm
centers on scaling transformer architectures with increasingly vast data and
model sizes, as seen in modern large language models. Despite their divergence,
this thesis seeks to establish conceptual connections bridging these paradigms.
Two complementary forces, structure and destructure, emerge across both
paradigms: structure organizes seen symbolic interactions, while destructure,
through periodic embedding resets, improves model plasticity and generalization
to unseen scenarios. These connections form a new recipe for developing general
knowledge engines that can support transparent, controllable, and adaptable
intelligent systems.

*Chia-Hsuan Hsu,Jun-En Ding,Hsin-Ling Hsu,Feng Liu,Fang-Ming Hung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces RPRO, a framework that improves medical question answering by combining reinforcement learning and reasoning refinement to enhance reliability and clinical relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs lack factual accuracy and clinical reliability in reasoning chains for medical question answering, necessitating a method to enhance reasoning precision and reliability.

Method: RPRO uses task-adaptive reasoning templates, probabilistic evaluation, groupwise ranking optimization, and KL-divergence regularization to refine clinical reasoning chains.

Result: RPRO shows consistent improvements on PubMedQA and MedQA-USMLE datasets, with the 1.1B parameter model outperforming larger 7B-13B models, including those specialized in medicine.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that combining preference optimization with quality-driven refinement creates scalable, reliable, and clinically grounded medical LLMs.

Abstract: Medical question answering requires advanced reasoning that integrates domain
knowledge with logical inference. However, existing large language models
(LLMs) often generate reasoning chains that lack factual accuracy and clinical
reliability. We propose Ranked Preference Reinforcement Optimization (RPRO), a
novel framework that uniquely combines reinforcement learning with
preference-driven reasoning refinement to enhance clinical chain-of-thought
(CoT) performance. RPRO differentiates itself from prior approaches by
employing task-adaptive reasoning templates and a probabilistic evaluation
mechanism that aligns outputs with established clinical workflows, while
automatically identifying and correcting low-quality reasoning chains. Unlike
traditional pairwise preference methods, RPRO introduces a groupwise ranking
optimization based on the Bradley-Terry model and incorporates KL-divergence
regularization for stable training. Experiments on PubMedQA and MedQA-USMLE
show consistent improvements over strong baselines. Remarkably, our 1.1B
parameter model outperforms much larger 7B-13B models, including
medical-specialized variants. These findings demonstrate that combining
preference optimization with quality-driven refinement offers a scalable and
effective approach to building more reliable, clinically grounded medical LLMs.

TL;DR: The paper focuses on ranking Bangla words using graph-based ranking algorithms by representing them as word graphs. It employs preprocessing, applies algorithms, and evaluates performance using the F1 measure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the lack of a standard Bangla word database and to explore the effectiveness of graph-based ranking algorithms in ranking Bangla words.

Method: The authors use the Indian Language POS-tag Corpora to construct word graphs and apply several preprocessing methods. Various graph-based ranking algorithms are then implemented and compared using F1 measure accuracy.

Result: The experimental analysis on real data demonstrates the accuracy and performance of the evaluated ranking algorithms.

Conclusion: The paper successfully illustrates a comprehensive procedure to rank Bangla words leveraging graph-based methods and provides valuable insights into the performance of different algorithms.

Abstract: Ranking words is an important way to summarize a text or to retrieve
information. A word graph is a way to represent the words of a sentence or a
text as the vertices of a graph and to show the relationship among the words.
It is also useful to determine the relative importance of a word among the
words in the word-graph. In this research, the ranking of Bangla words are
calculated, representing Bangla words from a text in a word graph using various
graph based ranking algorithms. There is a lack of a standard Bangla word
database. In this research, the Indian Language POS-tag Corpora is used, which
has a rich collection of Bangla words in the form of sentences with their parts
of speech tags. For applying a word graph to various graph based ranking
algorithms, several standard procedures are applied. The preprocessing steps
are done in every word graph and then applied to graph based ranking algorithms
to make a comparison among these algorithms. This paper illustrate the entire
procedure of calculating the ranking of Bangla words, including the
construction of the word graph from text. Experimental result analysis on real
data reveals the accuracy of each ranking algorithm in terms of F1 measure.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the cultural limitations of large language models (LLMs) by introducing a benchmark called TaarofBench to evaluate their understanding of Persian taarof, a ritual politeness norm, and demonstrates improvement methods for cultural alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lack competence in culturally-specific communication norms, limiting their global applicability, specifically in understanding Persian taarof, a nuanced system of politeness that is under-researched in AI benchmarks.

Method: The authors introduced TaarofBench, a dataset with 450 role-play scenarios validated by native speakers, to assess LLM performance. They also utilized supervised fine-tuning and Direct Preference Optimization for model improvement.

Result: Findings reveal that LLMs are 40-48% less accurate than native speakers in cultural interactions and show variations across prompts, topics, and genders. By fine-tuning, cultural alignment improvements of 21.8% and 42.3% were achieved.

Conclusion: The framework highlights LLMs' gaps in cultural understanding and emphasizes the importance of expanding benchmarks and methods for culturally sensitive AI, setting a foundation for globally aware applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle to navigate culturally specific
communication norms, limiting their effectiveness in global contexts. We focus
on Persian taarof, a social norm in Iranian interactions, which is a
sophisticated system of ritual politeness that emphasizes deference, modesty,
and indirectness, yet remains absent from existing cultural benchmarks. We
introduce TaarofBench, the first benchmark for evaluating LLM understanding of
taarof, comprising 450 role-play scenarios covering 12 common social
interaction topics, validated by native speakers. Our evaluation of five
frontier LLMs reveals substantial gaps in cultural competence, with accuracy
rates 40-48% below native speakers when taarof is culturally appropriate.
Performance varies between interaction topics, improves with Persian-language
prompts, and exhibits gender-based asymmetries. We also show that responses
rated "polite" by standard metrics often violate taarof norms, indicating the
limitations of Western politeness frameworks. Through supervised fine-tuning
and Direct Preference Optimization, we achieve 21.8% and 42.3% improvement in
model alignment with cultural expectations. Our human study with 33
participants (11 native Persian, 11 heritage, and 11 non-Iranian speakers)
forms baselines in varying degrees of familiarity with Persian norms. This work
lays the foundation for developing diverse and culturally aware LLMs, enabling
applications that better navigate complex social interactions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for improving style consistency in automated crisis communication responses using language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of stylistic consistency in language model-generated responses for crisis communications, which can impact trust.

Method: Develop a novel metric for evaluating style consistency and a two-stage fusion-based generation approach to optimize response quality and reduce stylistic variation.

Result: Experimental evaluation shows that the proposed method outperforms baselines in response quality and uniformity across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach is effective for ensuring stylistically consistent, high-quality responses in crisis communication scenarios.

Abstract: In response to the urgent need for effective communication with
crisis-affected populations, automated responses driven by language models have
been proposed to assist in crisis communications. A critical yet often
overlooked factor is the consistency of response style, which could affect the
trust of affected individuals in responders. Despite its importance, few
studies have explored methods for maintaining stylistic consistency across
generated responses. To address this gap, we propose a novel metric for
evaluating style consistency and introduce a fusion-based generation approach
grounded in this metric. Our method employs a two-stage process: it first
assesses the style of candidate responses and then optimizes and integrates
them at the instance level through a fusion process. This enables the
generation of high-quality responses while significantly reducing stylistic
variation between instances. Experimental results across multiple datasets
demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms baselines in both
response quality and stylistic uniformity.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the spread of online health misinformation by proposing a method for generating tailored counterspeech to match audience health literacy levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing counterspeech methods tend to produce standardized responses, overlooking the diversity in audience health literacy, which impacts the effectiveness of the interventions.

Method: The authors introduce a Controlled-Literacy framework using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) combined with reinforcement learning (RL). The system customizes counterspeech through retrieved knowledge specific to health literacy levels and optimizes it using a reward function based on user preferences and readability.

Result: Experimental results indicate that the Controlled-Literacy framework outperforms other approaches by producing counterspeech that is both more accessible and more highly preferred by users.

Conclusion: The research highlights the importance of tailoring health misinformation counterspeech to different literacy levels for more effective public health communication, contributing to equitable and impactful interventions.

Abstract: Health misinformation spreading online poses a significant threat to public
health. Researchers have explored methods for automatically generating
counterspeech to health misinformation as a mitigation strategy. Existing
approaches often produce uniform responses, ignoring that the health literacy
level of the audience could affect the accessibility and effectiveness of
counterspeech. We propose a Controlled-Literacy framework using
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with reinforcement learning (RL) to
generate tailored counterspeech adapted to different health literacy levels. In
particular, we retrieve knowledge aligned with specific health literacy levels,
enabling accessible and factual information to support generation. We design a
reward function incorporating subjective user preferences and objective
readability-based rewards to optimize counterspeech to the target health
literacy level. Experiment results show that Controlled-Literacy outperforms
baselines by generating more accessible and user-preferred counterspeech. This
research contributes to more equitable and impactful public health
communication by improving the accessibility and comprehension of counterspeech
to health misinformation.

TL;DR: This study benchmarks the capabilities of seven LLMs in solving Islamic inheritance law problems, revealing a substantial performance gap, with some models achieving over 90% accuracy while others fall below 50%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the reasoning and domain-specific capabilities of LLMs in the structured legal reasoning context of Islamic inheritance law.

Method: The researchers used a benchmark of 1,000 multiple-choice questions on Islamic inheritance scenarios to test seven LLMs' understanding and ability to compute prescribed inheritance shares under Islamic law.

Result: The study found that models like o3 and Gemini 2.5 performed well (90%+ accuracy), while others like ALLaM, Fanar, LLaMA, and Mistral performed poorly (below 50%). Error patterns were identified in understanding, rule application, and domain knowledge.

Conclusion: The paper exposes LLM limitations in structured legal reasoning for Islamic laws and suggests areas for performance enhancement in legal AI systems.

Abstract: This paper evaluates the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of Large
Language Models in Islamic inheritance law, known as 'ilm al-mawarith. We
assess the performance of seven LLMs using a benchmark of 1,000 multiple-choice
questions covering diverse inheritance scenarios, designed to test models'
ability to understand the inheritance context and compute the distribution of
shares prescribed by Islamic jurisprudence. The results reveal a significant
performance gap: o3 and Gemini 2.5 achieved accuracies above 90%, whereas
ALLaM, Fanar, LLaMA, and Mistral scored below 50%. These disparities reflect
important differences in reasoning ability and domain adaptation. We conduct a
detailed error analysis to identify recurring failure patterns across models,
including misunderstandings of inheritance scenarios, incorrect application of
legal rules, and insufficient domain knowledge. Our findings highlight
limitations in handling structured legal reasoning and suggest directions for
improving performance in Islamic legal reasoning. Code:

*Farah Adeeba,Rajesh Bhatt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates why the perfective form of the -ya: kar construction in modern Urdu and Hindi is ungrammatical, despite being present in 19th-century literature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding why a previously grammatical verb-aspect construction (-ya: kar in its perfective form) became ungrammatical in modern Urdu and Hindi.

Method: The study used historical text analysis, a large-scale corpus study, and subjective evaluation tasks with native speakers to identify patterns and grammatical acceptability.

Result: The perfective form is absent in modern use, confirmed by historical and corpus data, and judged unnatural by native speakers.

Conclusion: The ungrammaticality arises from a morphosyntactic conflict between nominative subject requirements and ergative case assignment, leading to the form's functional replacement over time.

Abstract: In this paper, we document a paradigm gap in the combinatorial possibilities
of verbs and aspect in Urdu: the perfective form of the -ya: kar construction
(e.g. ro-ya: ki: cry-Pfv do.Pfv) is sharply ungrammatical in modern Urdu and
Hindi, despite being freely attested in 19th century literature. We investigate
this diachronic shift through historical text analysis, a large-scale corpus
study which confirms the stark absence of perfective forms and subjective
evaluation tasks with native speakers, who judge perfective examples as highly
unnatural. We argue that this gap arose from a fundamental morphosyntactic
conflict: the construction's requirement for a nominative subject and an
invariant participle clashes with the core grammatical rule that transitive
perfective assign ergative case. This conflict rendered the perfective form
unstable, and its functional replacement by other constructions allowed the gap
to become entrenched in the modern grammar.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DistilledPRAG addresses privacy concerns in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by translating documents into LoRA representations within a knowledge-distilled framework, enhancing efficiency and maintaining high accuracy without exposing plaintext documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG systems risk private data exposure by requiring plaintext document uploads to the cloud. Parametric RAG (PRAG) offers privacy but suffers from inefficiency and poor generalization. The motivation is to create a more efficient and generalizable privacy-preserving RAG system.

Method: The authors propose a method where QA pairs are synthesized from single and multi-documents, documents are token-masked and translated into LoRA via a parameter generator, and the generator is trained to match standard RAG's features using synthetic QA data.

Result: DistilledPRAG demonstrates superior accuracy over baselines and shows strong performance in out-of-distribution (OOD) data scenarios across four QA datasets.

Conclusion: DistilledPRAG achieves efficient and privacy-preserving RAG-style reasoning while maintaining alignment with standard RAG, providing improved performance and better generalization without exposure of raw document content.

Abstract: The current RAG system requires uploading plaintext documents to the cloud,
risking private data leakage. Parametric RAG (PRAG) addresses this by encoding
documents as LoRA within LLMs, enabling reasoning without exposing raw content.
However, it still faces two issues: (1) PRAG demands synthesizing QA pairs and
fine-tuning LLM for each individual document to create its corresponding LoRA,
leading to unacceptable inference latency. (2) The performance of PRAG relies
solely on synthetic QA data, lacking internal alignment with standard RAG,
resulting in poor generalization on out-of-distribution(OOD) inputs. Therefore,
achieving high-efficiency parameterization while maintaining RAG-level
performance remains a critical challenge for privacy-preserving reasoning. In
this paper, we propose DistilledPRAG, a generalizable knowledge-distilled
parametric RAG model aligned with standard RAG in document structure and
parameter activation. We first synthesize QA pairs from single and
multi-documents to enhance cross-document reasoning. Then, we mask the
plaintext documents with a special token and translate them to LoRA via a
parameter generator, maintaining the standard RAG document structure. Finally,
guided by synthetic QA data, we train the parameter generator to match standard
RAG's hidden states and output logits, enabling RAG-style reasoning without
original documents. Experiments on four QA datasets show that DistilledPRAG
outperforms baselines in accuracy and generalizes well on OOD data.

### [157] [REFRAG: Rethinking RAG based Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01092)
*Xiaoqiang Lin,Aritra Ghosh,Bryan Kian Hsiang Low,Anshumali Shrivastava,Vijai Mohan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces REFRAG, a decoding framework for LLMs in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). It improves processing efficiency and latency of long-context inputs by exploiting sparsity, achieving significant speedups without a loss of accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies of processing long-context inputs in LLMs during RAG tasks, particularly the latency and memory demands due to sparse and unaligned semantic structures in the retrieved context.

Method: REFRAG compresses, senses, and selectively expands the RAG context during decoding, leveraging the sparsity of retrieved passages and eliminating unnecessary computations.

Result: REFRAG achieves a 30.85x acceleration in time-to-first-token and extends LLMs' context size by 16x without increasing perplexity, consistently outperforming current state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: REFRAG significantly enhances the efficiency of LLMs in RAG applications, offering considerable reductions in latency and enabling effective processing of extended contexts while maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
leveraging extensive external knowledge to enhance responses in multi-turn and
agentic applications, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However,
processing long-context inputs introduces significant system latency and
demands substantial memory for the key-value cache, resulting in reduced
throughput and a fundamental trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system
efficiency. While minimizing latency for long-context inputs is a primary
objective for LLMs, we contend that RAG require specialized consideration. In
RAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated passages from retrieval,
with only a small subset directly relevant to the query. These passages often
exhibit low semantic similarity due to diversity or deduplication during
re-ranking, leading to block-diagonal attention patterns that differ from those
in standard LLM generation tasks. Based on this observation, we argue that most
computations over the RAG context during decoding are unnecessary and can be
eliminated with minimal impact on performance. To this end, we propose REFRAG,
an efficient decoding framework that compresses, senses, and expands to improve
latency in RAG applications. By exploiting the sparsity structure, we
demonstrate a 30.85 the time-to-first-token acceleration (3.75 improvement to
previous work) without loss in perplexity. In addition, our optimization
framework for large context enables REFRAG to extend the context size of LLMs
by 16. We provide rigorous validation of REFRAG across diverse long-context
tasks, including RAG, multi-turn conversations, and long document
summarization, spanning a wide range of datasets. Experimental results confirm
that REFRAG delivers substantial speedup with no loss in accuracy compared to
LLaMA models and other state-of-the-art baselines across various context sizes.

*Yulong Wu,Viktor Schlegel,Riza Batista-Navarro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines how changes in natural context paragraphs affect the performance of generative language models in question answering tasks, finding that performance declines as semantic similarity with pretraining materials decreases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how language model performance in QA tasks is impacted by natural evolution and human edits of context passages, especially as they deviate from pretrained material.

Method: The researchers curated semantically varied, human-edited versions of reading passages across six QA datasets. They tested eight LLMs using a framework that measures semantic similarity between original and modified passages, analyzing model performance accordingly.

Result: Performance of tested LLMs declined significantly as the passage's semantic similarity to the pretraining set decreased. For example, BoolQ dataset accuracy fell by over 30% from the highest to lowest similarity bins.

Conclusion: Language models struggle with naturally evolved edits in text even when key information remains present, highlighting a limitation in their generalization capabilities.

Abstract: How does the natural evolution of context paragraphs affect question
answering in generative Large Language Models (LLMs)? To investigate this, we
propose a framework for curating naturally evolved, human-edited variants of
reading passages from contemporary QA benchmarks and for analyzing LLM
performance across a range of semantic similarity scores, which quantify how
closely each variant aligns with content seen during pretraining. Using this
framework, we evaluate six QA datasets and eight LLMs with publicly available
training data. Our experiments reveal that LLM performance declines as reading
passages naturally diverge from the versions encountered during
pretraining-even when the question and all necessary information remains
present at inference time. For instance, average model accuracy on BoolQ drops
by over 30% from the highest to lowest similarity bins, with slopes exceeding
70 across several LLMs. These findings suggest that natural text evolution
poses a significant challenge to the language understanding capabilities of
LLMs.

TL;DR: Dream-Coder 7B is an open-source language model with flexible coding task capabilities, adapting decoding strategies using discrete diffusion techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the limitations of traditional autoregressive code models by enabling adaptive and task-specific code generation strategies.

Method: The model adapts a pretrained AR checkpoint to a discrete diffusion framework using a continuous-time weighted cross-entropy objective. Post-training involves supervised fine-tuning to address padding issues and reinforcement learning focused on high-quality prompts.

Result: Dream-Coder 7B achieves 21.4% pass@1 on LiveCodeBench and strong performance on benchmarks such as HumanEval, MBPP, and BigCodeBench.

Conclusion: Dream-Coder 7B represents a step forward in adaptive code generation with discrete diffusion, offering open-source tools for further development and reproducibility.

Abstract: We present Dream-Coder 7B, an open-source discrete diffusion language model
for code generation that exhibits emergent any-order generation capabilities.
Unlike traditional autoregressive (AR) models that decode strictly
left-to-right, Dream-Coder 7B adaptively determines its decoding strategy based
on the coding task: sketch-first generation for complex algorithms,
left-to-right generation for straightforward completions, and interleaved
reasoning generation for code understanding tasks. We adapt a pretrained AR
checkpoint to a discrete diffusion frameworks with a continuous-time weighted
cross-entropy objective. Our post-training recipe comprises (i) supervised
fine-tuning, where we mitigate padding pathologies via random truncation and a
padding penalty to improve sample efficiency and stabilize generation; and (ii)
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards over a curated high-quality
prompt set drawn from open-source datasets, using a tailored reinforcement
learning recipe for diffusion language models. The resulting Dream-Coder 7B
Instruct attains 21.4\% pass@1 on LiveCodeBench (2410--2505) and demonstrates
competitive performance on HumanEval, MBPP, BigCodeBench, and CRUXEval. We
release Dream-Coder-7B and Dream-Coder-7B-Instruct checkpoints, training
recipes, preprocessing pipelines, and inference code to facilitate
reproducibility and further research.

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in cross-lingual named entity recognition (CL-NER), proposing a novel method for improving performance on non-Latin script languages (NSL) like Chinese and Japanese.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance knowledge transfer from high-resource languages to low-resource languages, particularly for non-Latin script languages where performance degrades due to structural differences.

Method: The authors introduce an entity-aligned translation (EAT) approach that uses large language models (LLMs) and a dual-translation strategy to improve entity alignment.

Result: EAT improves cross-lingual named entity recognition performance for non-Latin script languages by aligning entities between NSL and English.

Conclusion: The proposed EAT approach contributes to better knowledge transfer and improved zero-shot CL-NER for structurally diverse languages.

Abstract: Cross-lingual Named Entity Recognition (CL-NER) aims to transfer knowledge
from high-resource languages to low-resource languages. However, existing
zero-shot CL-NER (ZCL-NER) approaches primarily focus on Latin script language
(LSL), where shared linguistic features facilitate effective knowledge
transfer. In contrast, for non-Latin script language (NSL), such as Chinese and
Japanese, performance often degrades due to deep structural differences. To
address these challenges, we propose an entity-aligned translation (EAT)
approach. Leveraging large language models (LLMs), EAT employs a
dual-translation strategy to align entities between NSL and English. In
addition, we fine-tune LLMs using multilingual Wikipedia data to enhance the
entity alignment from source to target languages.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Tea-MOELoRA, a framework for efficient Chinese information extraction spanning multiple tasks and eras, combining LoRA and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effective extraction across various tasks and temporal domains in Chinese documents without interference from heterogeneity in tasks and eras.

Method: The framework employs LoRA-based low-rank experts specialized for specific tasks and eras, paired with a dynamic router for adaptive expert allocation.

Result: Tea-MOELoRA outperforms single-task and joint LoRA baselines in extracting temporal and task-specific knowledge.

Conclusion: Tea-MOELoRA successfully enhances multi-task Chinese IE while addressing performance issues arising from task and era heterogeneity.

Abstract: Chinese information extraction (IE) involves multiple tasks across diverse
temporal domains, including Classical and Modern documents. Fine-tuning a
single model on heterogeneous tasks and across different eras may lead to
interference and reduced performance. Therefore, in this paper, we propose
Tea-MOELoRA, a parameter-efficient multi-task framework that combines LoRA with
a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design. Multiple low-rank LoRA experts specialize in
different IE tasks and eras, while a task-era-aware router mechanism
dynamically allocates expert contributions. Experiments show that Tea-MOELoRA
outperforms both single-task and joint LoRA baselines, demonstrating its
ability to leverage task and temporal knowledge effectively.

*Yu Liu,Yanan Cao,Xixun Lin,Yanmin Shang,Shi Wang,Shirui Pan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework called SAT for improving knowledge graph completion (KGC) by aligning graph embeddings and natural language spaces while simplifying task-specific instructions. It outperforms existing methods with significant improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KGC relies on reasoning from knowledge graphs, but challenges like inconsistent representation spaces between language and graphs and redundant instruction designs hinder progress.

Method: The SAT framework introduces hierarchical knowledge alignment with multi-task contrastive learning for embedding alignment. It also employs structural instruction tuning that unifies graph instructions via a lightweight knowledge adapter.

Result: SAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two KGC tasks and delivers a significant performance boost (8.7%-29.8%) in link prediction across four datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed SAT framework successfully addresses key challenges in KGC, showcasing superior reasoning capabilities and efficiency improvements over existing approaches.

Abstract: Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to infer new knowledge and make
predictions from knowledge graphs. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have
exhibited remarkable reasoning capabilities. LLM-enhanced KGC methods primarily
focus on designing task-specific instructions, achieving promising
advancements. However, there are still two critical challenges. First, existing
methods often ignore the inconsistent representation spaces between natural
language and graph structures. Second, most approaches design separate
instructions for different KGC tasks, leading to duplicate works and
time-consuming processes. To address these challenges, we propose SAT, a novel
framework that enhances LLMs for KGC via structure-aware alignment-tuning.
Specifically, we first introduce hierarchical knowledge alignment to align
graph embeddings with the natural language space through multi-task contrastive
learning. Then, we propose structural instruction tuning to guide LLMs in
performing structure-aware reasoning over KGs, using a unified graph
instruction combined with a lightweight knowledge adapter. Experimental results
on two KGC tasks across four benchmark datasets demonstrate that SAT
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in the link
prediction task with improvements ranging from 8.7% to 29.8%.

TL;DR: The paper presents a modular framework for generating synthetic long-context datasets using LLMs, addressing training and evaluation deficiencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to address the limitations in LLMs' ability to process long textual inputs by providing diverse and high-quality datasets.

Method: A modular framework leverages prompt-based interaction with LLMs, offering multiple data generation paradigms and alignment methods like SFT, DPO, and GRPO.

Result: The approach enables scalable and controllable data creation with enriched metadata tailored to enhance LLMs' long-context capabilities.

Conclusion: This modular framework contributes significantly to improving LLMs' performance in processing and reasoning over longer texts by overcoming data quality challenges.

Abstract: The ability of large language models (LLMs) to process and reason over long
textual inputs is critical for a wide range of real-world applications.
However, progress in this area is significantly constrained by the absence of
high-quality, diverse, and verifiable long-context datasets suitable for both
training and evaluation. This work introduces a modular, extensible framework
for synthetic long-context data generation via prompt-based interaction with
LLMs. The framework supports multiple training and alignment objectives,
including Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO),
and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). It encompasses four core
generation paradigms: multi-turn conversational dialogues, document-grounded
input-output pairs, verifiable instruction-response tasks, and long-context
reasoning examples. Through templated prompting, a model-agnostic architecture,
and metadata-enriched outputs, the proposed approach facilitates scalable,
controllable, and purpose-aligned dataset creation for advancing long-context
capabilities in LLMs.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of interpretive ambiguity in AI alignment systems and suggests a legal theory-inspired framework to manage it, achieving improvements in consistency using the proposed methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the underexplored challenge of interpretive ambiguity in AI systems reliant on natural language principles, which can lead to inconsistent or unstable behavior.

Method: The authors propose a computational framework inspired by legal mechanisms, including (1) a rule refinement pipeline to reduce ambiguity and (2) prompt-based interpretive constraints for consistency during application.

Result: Implemented on a subset of the WildChat dataset, the proposed framework significantly enhances judgment consistency among interpreters.

Conclusion: The paper presents a foundational step toward addressing interpretive ambiguity in AI alignment, making AI systems more robust and better at adhering to rule-based frameworks.

Abstract: AI systems are increasingly governed by natural language principles, yet a
key challenge arising from reliance on language remains underexplored:
interpretive ambiguity. As in legal systems, ambiguity arises both from how
these principles are written and how they are applied. But while legal systems
use institutional safeguards to manage such ambiguity, such as transparent
appellate review policing interpretive constraints, AI alignment pipelines
offer no comparable protections. Different interpretations of the same rule can
lead to inconsistent or unstable model behavior. Drawing on legal theory, we
identify key gaps in current alignment pipelines by examining how legal systems
constrain ambiguity at both the rule creation and rule application steps. We
then propose a computational framework that mirrors two legal mechanisms: (1) a
rule refinement pipeline that minimizes interpretive disagreement by revising
ambiguous rules (analogous to agency rulemaking or iterative legislative
action), and (2) prompt-based interpretive constraints that reduce
inconsistency in rule application (analogous to legal canons that guide
judicial discretion). We evaluate our framework on a 5,000-scenario subset of
the WildChat dataset and show that both interventions significantly improve
judgment consistency across a panel of reasonable interpreters. Our approach
offers a first step toward systematically managing interpretive ambiguity, an
essential step for building more robust, law-following AI systems.

Motivation: Addressing the challenge of balancing computational efficiency and high performance in real-world applications of LLMs.

Method: Introduces 'Zero-Shot Adjustable Acceleration,' a method to dynamically adjust hardware resources during inference without requiring additional fine-tuning.

Result: The method allows for extensive zero-shot hardware acceleration and delivers up to a remarkable 11x speedup over baseline methods.

Conclusion: The technique offers a practical solution for improving inference efficiency in LLMs while maintaining performance, with significant real-world applicability.

Abstract: Using Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications presents
significant challenges, particularly in balancing computational efficiency and

introduces Zero-Shot Adjustable Acceleration, a novel training and inference
method that dynamically adjusts hardware usage during inference without
requiring additional fine-tuning. The proposed approach is applied to newly

TL;DR: SimulMEGA introduces an unsupervised policy learning framework for optimizing real-time multilingual Simultaneous Speech Translation, achieving higher translation quality, lower latency, and improved semantic coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in balancing translation quality, latency, and coherence in multilingual real-time speech translation systems, which are currently hindered by divergent read and write policies.

Method: The authors propose SimulMEGA, an unsupervised framework that uses prefix-based training and a Mixture-of-Experts refiner, requiring minimal changes to transformer architectures to optimize read and write decisions effectively.

Result: SimulMEGA improved speech-to-text model performance, achieving under 7% BLEU degradation at 1.5s lag and under 3% at 3s lag for six language pairs while also demonstrating strong results in streaming text-to-speech tasks.

Conclusion: SimulMEGA effectively enhances multilingual Simultaneous Speech Translation and streaming TTS with superior quality-latency tradeoffs while remaining versatile and computationally efficient.

Abstract: Simultaneous Speech Translation (SimulST) enables real-time cross-lingual
communication by jointly optimizing speech recognition and machine translation
under strict latency constraints. Existing systems struggle to balance
translation quality, latency, and semantic coherence, particularly in
multilingual many-to-many scenarios where divergent read and write policies
hinder unified strategy learning. In this paper, we present SimulMEGA
(Simultaneous Generation by Mixture-of-Experts Gating), an unsupervised policy
learning framework that combines prefix-based training with a
Mixture-of-Experts refiner to learn effective read and write decisions in an
implicit manner, without adding inference-time overhead. Our design requires
only minimal modifications to standard transformer architectures and
generalizes across both speech-to-text and text-to-speech streaming tasks.
Through comprehensive evaluation on six language pairs, our 500M parameter
speech-to-text model outperforms the Seamless baseline, achieving under 7
percent BLEU degradation at 1.5 seconds average lag and under 3 percent at 3
seconds. We further demonstrate the versatility of SimulMEGA by extending it to
streaming TTS with a unidirectional backbone, yielding superior latency quality
tradeoffs.

*Ege Süalp,Mina Rezaei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether growth-based pretraining in large language models (LLMs) mitigates catastrophic forgetting during continual learning by leveraging smaller models in training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address catastrophic forgetting in LLMs during continual learning, a critical issue as it threatens their ability to retain prior knowledge while fine-tuning on new tasks.

Method: The authors used a growth-based pretraining strategy called Stack LLM, which employs transformer stacking, and evaluated its performance on tasks like domain knowledge, reasoning, reading comprehension, and bias relative to a baseline LLM.

Result: Both Stack LLM and the baseline model showed improvements in domain knowledge, but reasoning and reading comprehension tasks degraded over time due to catastrophic forgetting. However, Stack LLM exhibited less degradation, especially in reading comprehension. Bias evaluation showed differing patterns, with Stack LLM maintaining bias stability while the baseline LLM became more neutral.

Conclusion: Growth-based pretraining (Stack LLM) offers modest benefits in mitigating catastrophic forgetting and enhanced retention in certain tasks, but it also involves trade-offs in the form of bias handling challenges.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting is a significant challenge in continual learning, in
which a model loses prior knowledge when it is fine-tuned on new tasks. This
problem is particularly critical for large language models (LLMs) undergoing
continual learning, as retaining performance across diverse domains is
important for their general utility. In this paper, we explore model growth, a
promising strategy that leverages smaller models to expedite and structure the
training of larger ones for mitigating the catastrophic forgetting problem.
Although growth-based pretraining, particularly via transformer stacking, has
shown promise in accelerating convergence, its impact on forgetting remains
under-explored. Therefore, we evaluate whether growth-based models can retain
previously learned capabilities more effectively across a sequence of
fine-tuning tasks involving domain knowledge, reasoning, reading comprehension,
and bias. Our findings show that both models -- one trained with growth (Stack
LLM) and one without (LLM) -- exhibit improvements in domain knowledge.
However, reasoning and reading comprehension degrade over time, indicating
signs of catastrophic forgetting. Stack LLM consistently shows less
degradation, especially in reading comprehension, suggesting enhanced retention
capabilities. Interestingly, in bias evaluation, the baseline LLM becomes
progressively more neutral with continued fine-tuning, while Stack LLM
maintains a steady bias ratio around 60--61\%. These results indicate that
growth-based pretraining may deliver modest improvements in resisting
catastrophic forgetting, though trade-offs remain in handling social biases.

*Wei Huang,Huang Wei,Yinggui Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DaMoC, a framework for optimizing LLMs for domain-specific tasks by compressing data and models, improving selection and efficiency in fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs perform well in general tasks but often fail to address domain-specific ones effectively; selecting an optimal LLM for fine-tuning remains a challenge.

Method: The framework has two main components: 1) a data-level approach categorizing data filtering methodologies and enhancing text token density, and 2) a model-level approach using layer similarity scores and sparse merging for efficient compression.

Result: Experiments across four datasets demonstrate the approach's ability to identify optimal LLMs while achieving a 20-fold reduction in training time.

Conclusion: DaMoC provides a systematic way to efficiently optimize and select LLMs for domain-specific tasks, significantly improving resource utilization in model fine-tuning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in general tasks but struggle with
domain-specific ones, requiring fine-tuning with specific data. With many
open-source LLMs available, selecting the best model for fine-tuning downstream
tasks is challenging, primarily focusing on how to quickly identify the optimal
LLM. We introduce a Data and Model Compression Framework (DaMoC) that addresses
this challenge by: 1) Data Level: A systematic categorization of data filtering
methodologies for LLMs is first established, classifying them into three
distinct paradigms: (1) distribution-aware methods, (2) quality-aware methods,
and (3) hybrid approaches considering both dimensions. Further, we enhance the
density of key tokens in the text achieving token compression. Subsequently, we
use an LLM to iterative rewrite the text to optimize its expression. 2) Model
Level: We use layer similarity scores to assess each layer's importance and
remove those with lower importance. Then, we introduce a sparse merging
paradigm to preserve as much of the original model's capability as possible.
Extensive experiments on four datasets, medical Q&A, financial Q&A, general
Q&A, and reading comprehension, show that we can select the optimal LLM while
saving approximately 20-fold in training time.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores Chain-of-Thought reasoning in large language models, focusing on the interaction between in-context learning and pretrained priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how Chain-of-Thought reasoning operates, particularly its dual relationship with in-context learning and pretrained priors in large language models.

Method: Conducting lexical-level analysis, introducing noisy exemplars, and analyzing the effects of prompt engineering on reasoning behavior.

Result: The study reveals that models learn both reasoning structures and patterns, rely on pretrained priors, adopt in-context signals with sufficient exemplars, but show instability with misleading prompts, and longer prompts improve reasoning and task performance.

Conclusion: Chain-of-Thought reasoning is extensively influenced by pretrained priors, but careful design of prompts and exemplars can enhance reasoning capabilities in large language models.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought reasoning has emerged as a pivotal methodology for enhancing
model inference capabilities. Despite growing interest in Chain-of-Thought
reasoning, its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This paper explores the
working mechanisms of Chain-of-Thought reasoning from the perspective of the
dual relationship between in-context learning and pretrained priors. We first
conduct a fine-grained lexical-level analysis of rationales to examine the
model's reasoning behavior. Then, by incrementally introducing noisy exemplars,
we examine how the model balances pretrained priors against erroneous
in-context information. Finally, we investigate whether prompt engineering can
induce slow thinking in large language models. Our extensive experiments reveal
three key findings: (1) The model not only quickly learns the reasoning
structure at the lexical level but also grasps deeper logical reasoning
patterns, yet it heavily relies on pretrained priors. (2) Providing sufficient
exemplars shifts the model's decision-making from pretrained priors to
in-context signals, while misleading prompts introduce instability. (3) Long
Chain-of-Thought prompting can induce the model to generate longer reasoning
chains, thereby improving its performance on downstream tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores a unique evaluative approach to annotating emotion in text, leveraging language models to analyze disagreements and linguistic trends in collected annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emotion in textual manifestations remains an open subject, and this study introduces an underutilized evaluative framework to complement traditional approaches.

Method: Manual annotation of an industrial corpus based on an evaluative emotional framework; statistical trend analysis; training language models using these annotations.

Result: Significant annotation disagreements occur, but stable statistical patterns and predictive capabilities are revealed based on linguistic features.

Conclusion: Language models trained on evaluative annotations can model emotional labeling processes effectively and distinguish emotional scenarios based on underlying evaluative criteria.

Abstract: Emotion is a crucial phenomenon in the functioning of human beings in
society. However, it remains a widely open subject, particularly in its textual
manifestations. This paper examines an industrial corpus manually annotated
following an evaluative approach to emotion. This theoretical framework, which
is currently underutilized, offers a different perspective that complements
traditional approaches. Noting that the annotations we collected exhibit
significant disagreement, we hypothesized that they nonetheless follow stable
statistical trends. Using language models trained on these annotations, we
demonstrate that it is possible to model the labeling process and that
variability is driven by underlying linguistic features. Conversely, our
results indicate that language models seem capable of distinguishing emotional
situations based on evaluative criteria.

*Juhyun Oh,Inha Cha,Michael Saxon,Hyunseung Lim,Shaily Bhatt,Alice Oh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Current evaluation approaches for cultural alignment in language models are inadequate, as they simplify culture to trivia and ignore broader cultural assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the superficial nature of current evaluation paradigms that neglect the complexity and embedded cultural contexts in language models.

Method: The paper advocates for intentionally cultural evaluation, systematically analyzing cultural assumptions in evaluation processes and emphasizing inclusive methodologies.

Result: The authors characterize culturally contingent factors in evaluation settings and propose engaging diverse communities through participatory methods inspired by HCI.

Conclusion: A shift is needed towards inclusive and culturally aligned NLP evaluation frameworks, enabling discovery of unseen applications and fostering diverse community collaboration.

Abstract: The prevailing ``trivia-centered paradigm'' for evaluating the cultural
alignment of large language models (LLMs) is increasingly inadequate as these
models become more advanced and widely deployed. Existing approaches typically
reduce culture to static facts or values, testing models via multiple-choice or
short-answer questions that treat culture as isolated trivia. Such methods
neglect the pluralistic and interactive realities of culture, and overlook how
cultural assumptions permeate even ostensibly ``neutral'' evaluation settings.
In this position paper, we argue for \textbf{intentionally cultural
evaluation}: an approach that systematically examines the cultural assumptions
embedded in all aspects of evaluation, not just in explicitly cultural tasks.
We systematically characterize the what, how, and circumstances by which
culturally contingent considerations arise in evaluation, and emphasize the
importance of researcher positionality for fostering inclusive, culturally
aligned NLP research. Finally, we discuss implications and future directions
for moving beyond current benchmarking practices, discovering important
applications that we don't know exist, and involving communities in evaluation
design through HCI-inspired participatory methodologies.

### [172] [TableZoomer: A Collaborative Agent Framework for Large-scale Table Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01312)
*Sishi Xiong,Ziyang He,Zhongjiang He,Yu Zhao,Changzai Pan,Jie Zhang,Zhenhe Wu,Shuangyong Song,Yongxiang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces TableZoomer, a framework designed to enhance table question answering (TQA) performance using large language models (LLMs) by solving challenges such as structural heterogeneity and complex reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs face difficulties in industrial applications for TQA, including table structure inconsistencies, data localization, and reasoning bottlenecks.

Method: The framework employs structured table schema, query-aware table zooming for selective data localization, and a Program-of-Thoughts (PoT) strategy to transform queries into executable code. ReAct paradigm is integrated for iterative reasoning processes.

Result: TableZoomer achieves significant accuracy improvements: 19.34% in the large-scale DataBench dataset and 25% in the Fact Checking task of TableBench dataset.

Conclusion: The framework enhances usability, accuracy, and scalability in TQA tasks using LLM-powered approaches while addressing key limitations.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in the table question
answering (TQA) task through prompt engineering, they face challenges in
industrial applications, including structural heterogeneity, difficulties in
target data localization, and bottlenecks in complex reasoning. To address
these limitations, this paper presents TableZoomer, a novel LLM-powered,
programming-based agent framework. It introduces three key innovations: (1)
replacing the original fully verbalized table with structured table schema to
bridge the semantic gap and reduce computational complexity; (2) a query-aware
table zooming mechanism that dynamically generates sub-table schema through
column selection and entity linking, significantly improving target
localization efficiency; and (3) a Program-of-Thoughts (PoT) strategy that
transforms queries into executable code to mitigate numerical hallucination.
Additionally, we integrate the reasoning workflow with the ReAct paradigm to
enable iterative reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
framework maintains the usability advantages while substantially enhancing
performance and scalability across tables of varying scales. When implemented
with the Qwen3-8B-Instruct LLM, TableZoomer achieves accuracy improvements of
19.34% and 25% over conventional PoT methods on the large-scale DataBench
dataset and the small-scale Fact Checking task of TableBench dataset,
respectively.

### [173] [Can Smaller LLMs do better? Unlocking Cross-Domain Potential through Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for Text Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01314)
*Anum Afzal,Mehul Kumawat,Florian Matthes*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFTs) techniques to adapt large language models to low-resource domains, particularly for text summarization tasks, aiming at better performance without relying on extensive computational resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle to adapt effectively to low-resource domains due to limited labeled data and expensive fine-tuning requirements. Efficient adaptability solutions are needed to overcome these challenges.

Method: The study benchmarks six PEFT techniques using the Llama-3-8B-Instruct model across 14 datasets from diverse domains, focusing on a text summarization task. It evaluates domain adaptation using intra-domain and cross-domain adapter strategies.

Result: For low-resource domains, Within-Domain Adapters significantly outperform Few-Shot techniques and even surpass the performance of a much larger Llama-3-70B-Instruct model. Strategic combinations of adapters leveraging inter-domain linguistic similarities also show promise.

Conclusion: PEFT techniques offer an effective, efficient solution for domain adaptation in low-resource settings, with adapters enabling improved performance by leveraging linguistic commonalities across domains.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), being generic task solvers, are versatile.
However, despite the vast amount of data they are trained on, there are
speculations about their adaptation capabilities to a new domain. Additionally,
the simple fine-tuning of the model to incorporate knowledge of a new domain is
computationally expensive and time-consuming. This becomes more challenging
when the domain in question is also low-resource, and labeled data is
unavailable. We leverage parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques (PEFTs) on
high-resource datasets to address these challenges to improve performance on
unseen low-resource domains. Throughout our experiments, we evaluate whether
intrinsic linguistic commonalities between datasets can be leveraged for
efficient domain adaptation. We benchmark six PEFTs with
\texttt{Llama-3-8B-Instruct} on 14 training datasets from the Scientific,
Medical, Legal, and News domains for a Text Summarization task. Our experiments
show that for low-resource domains, inference using Within-Domain Adapters can
achieve better performance than Few-Shot as well as a much larger
\texttt{Llama-3-70B-Instruct}. Lastly, in the absence of Within-Domain
Adapters, we explore the concept of using Cross-Domain Adapters as well as the
strategic combinations of adapters to leverage intrinsic language similarities
across domains, facilitating better adaptability and performance in
low-resource settings.

*Jihyung Lee,Daehui Kim,Seonjeong Hwang,Hyounghun Kim,Gary Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces KoBLEX, a Korean benchmark for legal explainable QA, and proposes ParSeR, a method for provision-grounded legal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing legal benchmarks are inadequate for evaluating open-ended, provision-grounded, multi-hop legal reasoning in LLMs.

Method: KoBLEX was developed using a hybrid LLM-human expert pipeline with 226 QA instances. ParSeR employs parametric provisions and a three-stage retrieval process. LF-Eval is proposed for legal fidelity assessment.

Result: Experimental results show ParSeR outperforms strong baselines, achieving significant improvements in F1 score (+37.91) and LF-Eval (+30.81) compared to standard retrieval with GPT-4.

Conclusion: ParSeR enhances the ability of LLMs to handle complex legal QA tasks with consistent performance and strong alignment with legal reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) have achieved remarkable performances in general
domains and are now extending into the expert domain of law. Several benchmarks
have been proposed to evaluate LLMs' legal capabilities. However, these
benchmarks fail to evaluate open-ended and provision-grounded Question
Answering (QA). To address this, we introduce a Korean Benchmark for Legal
EXplainable QA (KoBLEX), designed to evaluate provision-grounded, multi-hop
legal reasoning. KoBLEX includes 226 scenario-based QA instances and their
supporting provisions, created using a hybrid LLM-human expert pipeline. We
also propose a method called Parametric provision-guided Selection Retrieval
(ParSeR), which uses LLM-generated parametric provisions to guide legally
grounded and reliable answers. ParSeR facilitates multi-hop reasoning on
complex legal questions by generating parametric provisions and employing a
three-stage sequential retrieval process. Furthermore, to better evaluate the
legal fidelity of the generated answers, we propose Legal Fidelity Evaluation
(LF-Eval). LF-Eval is an automatic metric that jointly considers the question,
answer, and supporting provisions and shows a high correlation with human
judgments. Experimental results show that ParSeR consistently outperforms
strong baselines, achieving the best results across multiple LLMs. Notably,
compared to standard retrieval with GPT-4o, ParSeR achieves +37.91 higher F1
and +30.81 higher LF-Eval. Further analyses reveal that ParSeR efficiently
delivers consistent performance across reasoning depths, with ablations
confirming the effectiveness of ParSeR.

*Wei Wang,Fuqing Bie,Junzhe Chen,Dan Zhang,Shiyu Huang,Evgeny Kharlamov,Jie Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to master complex card games and examines their learning capacity, ability to generalize, and retention of other capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore whether large language models (LLMs), which have shown remarkable performance in various tasks, can also succeed in mastering complex games, comparable to the success of specialized AI systems like AlphaGo and MuZero.

Method: The authors systematically evaluated LLMs on eight diverse card games, analyzing the effects of fine-tuning using high-quality gameplay data and investigating the balance between mastering games and retaining general capabilities.

Result: 1) Fine-tuned LLMs can perform close to strong game AIs, 2) LLMs can simultaneously master multiple similar card games but may face challenges for dissimilar ones, and 3) Mastering complex games leads to a reduction in general capabilities, though this can be mitigated with additional general instruction data.

Conclusion: The study highlights the strong learning potential and versatility of LLMs in mastering complex games, while addressing trade-offs between game-specific expertise and general ability.

Abstract: Complex games have long been an important benchmark for testing the progress
of artificial intelligence algorithms. AlphaGo, AlphaZero, and MuZero have
defeated top human players in Go and Chess, garnering widespread societal
attention towards artificial intelligence. Concurrently, large language models
(LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities across various tasks, raising the
question of whether LLMs can achieve similar success in complex games. In this
paper, we explore the potential of LLMs in mastering complex card games. We
systematically assess the learning capabilities of LLMs across eight diverse
card games, evaluating the impact of fine-tuning on high-quality gameplay data,
and examining the models' ability to retain general capabilities while
mastering these games. Our findings indicate that: (1) LLMs can approach the
performance of strong game AIs through supervised fine-tuning on high-quality
data, (2) LLMs can master multiple complex card games simultaneously, with
performance augmentation for games with similar rules and conflicts for
dissimilar ones, and (3) LLMs experience a decline in general capabilities when
mastering complex games, but this decline can be mitigated by integrating a
certain amount of general instruction data. The evaluation results demonstrate
strong learning ability and versatility of LLMs.

*Mohammad Zbeeb,Hasan Abed Al Kader Hammoud,Bernard Ghanem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a simple method to transfer reasoning abilities between large language models using a compact reasoning vector, derived from models fine-tuned via SFT and reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to reduce the costs associated with training large language models for complex reasoning tasks by enabling the transfer of reasoning capabilities through vector arithmetic.

Method: The authors derived a reasoning vector ($v_{reason}$) by subtracting the parameters of a supervised fine-tuned model (SFT) from a reinforcement learning fine-tuned model (GRPO). This vector is then added to other instruction-tuned models to enhance reasoning ability.

Result: Adding the reasoning vector improved model performance on diverse benchmarks like GSM8K (+4.9%), HumanEval (+4.3%), SciQ (+1.7%), and BigBenchHard (+12.3%), while subtracting it caused performance degradation (-11.8% on GSM8K).

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that reasoning capabilities can be extracted and transferred between models using simple arithmetic operations, offering a cost-effective way to enhance model reasoning skills.

Abstract: Large language models often require costly optimization, such as
reinforcement learning, to master complex reasoning tasks. This work
demonstrates that reasoning ability, once learned, can be extracted and
transferred between models as a compact task vector. We source two publicly
available, identically initialized Qwen2.5 models, one fine-tuned with
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and the other with group relative policy
optimization (GRPO) on the same dataset. From these, we extract a reasoning
vector: $v_{\text{reason}} = \theta_{\text{GRPO}} - \theta_{\text{SFT}}$. We
hypothesize that this vector captures the reasoning capability instilled by
reinforcement learning while factoring out shared knowledge from the SFT
process. When added to compatible instruction-tuned models through simple
arithmetic, this vector consistently improves performance across diverse
reasoning benchmarks: GSM8K (+4.9%), HumanEval (+4.3%), SciQ (+1.7%), and
BigBenchHard (+12.3% for the 1.5B model). The performance improvements persist
under adversarial conditions. Conversely, subtracting the vector causes
significant performance degradation (-11.8% on GSM8K), demonstrating the
vector's strong contribution to the model's reasoning abilities. This work
shows how reasoning capabilities, typically developed through expensive
training, can be extracted from existing open-source models and reused through
simple tensor arithmetic, offering a practical way to enhance models by
recycling prior computational investments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces WATCHED, an AI chatbot for aiding content moderators in identifying and explaining decisions on hate speech, surpassing existing methods with a macro F1 score of 0.91.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing issue of online harm, particularly hate speech, necessitates combining automated tools with human judgment to improve user safety and platform trust.

Method: The chatbot, powered by Large Language Models and a BERT-based classifier, employs comparisons of posts, slang translation, chain-of-thought reasoning, and policy alignment to evaluate and explain hate speech content.

Result: WATCHED outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches with a macro F1 score of 0.91.

Conclusion: WATCHED bridges AI and human collaboration to effectively mitigate hate speech, demonstrating both technical accuracy and usability for content moderators.

Abstract: Online harms are a growing problem in digital spaces, putting user safety at
risk and reducing trust in social media platforms. One of the most persistent
forms of harm is hate speech. To address this, we need tools that combine the
speed and scale of automated systems with the judgment and insight of human
moderators. These tools should not only find harmful content but also explain
their decisions clearly, helping to build trust and understanding. In this
paper, we present WATCHED, a chatbot designed to support content moderators in
tackling hate speech. The chatbot is built as an Artificial Intelligence Agent
system that uses Large Language Models along with several specialised tools. It
compares new posts with real examples of hate speech and neutral content, uses
a BERT-based classifier to help flag harmful messages, looks up slang and
informal language using sources like Urban Dictionary, generates
chain-of-thought reasoning, and checks platform guidelines to explain and
support its decisions. This combination allows the chatbot not only to detect
hate speech but to explain why content is considered harmful, grounded in both
precedent and policy. Experimental results show that our proposed method
surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods, reaching a macro F1 score of 0.91.
Designed for moderators, safety teams, and researchers, the tool helps reduce
online harms by supporting collaboration between AI and human oversight.

*Serwar Basch,Ilia Kuznetsov,Tom Hope,Iryna Gurevych*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a domain-agnostic framework for efficiently creating and evaluating datasets of cross-document links, involving semi-synthetic datasets, model evaluations, and human validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-document understanding is vital for various applications, but there is a lack of efficient methods to create datasets for training and evaluation.

Method: The authors designed a framework that generates semi-synthetic datasets, evaluates linking approaches automatically, and combines results with human evaluations.

Result: The framework demonstrated that integrating retrieval models with large language models (LLMs) achieved 78% link approval by human raters, significantly improving precision over retrievers alone.

Conclusion: The framework enables systematic exploration of cross-document relations and provides datasets that facilitate diverse applications such as media framing and peer review analysis.

Abstract: Understanding fine-grained relations between documents is crucial for many
application domains. However, the study of automated assistance is limited by
the lack of efficient methods to create training and evaluation datasets of
cross-document links. To address this, we introduce a new domain-agnostic
framework for selecting a best-performing approach and annotating
cross-document links in a new domain from scratch. We first generate and
validate semi-synthetic datasets of interconnected documents. This data is used
to perform automatic evaluation, producing a shortlist of best-performing
linking approaches. These approaches are then used in an extensive human
evaluation study, yielding performance estimates on natural text pairs. We
apply our framework in two distinct domains -- peer review and news -- and show
that combining retrieval models with LLMs achieves 78\% link approval from
human raters, more than doubling the precision of strong retrievers alone. Our
framework enables systematic study of cross-document understanding across
application scenarios, and the resulting novel datasets lay foundation for
numerous cross-document tasks like media framing and peer review. We make the
code, data, and annotation protocols openly available.

TL;DR: This study examines the statistical and linguistic properties of neural audio codecs (NACs) and their relationship to speech quality and intelligibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how NAC token-level properties align with linguistic statistical laws and impact semantic and acoustic preservation of speech.

Method: Analyzed NAC tokens for adherence to Zipf's and Heaps' laws, entropy, redundancy, and evaluated speech quality using error rates in ASR and UTMOS scores.

Result: Discovered that NAC tokens exhibit language-like statistical patterns, particularly 3-grams, and these properties correlate with better performance in speech-related tasks.

Conclusion: The study highlights the significance of statistical structures in NAC tokens for designing effective generative speech models.

Abstract: This study presents a comparative analysis of the statistical and linguistic
properties of neural audio codecs (NACs). We investigate discrete speech tokens
produced by various NAC models, examining their adherence to linguistic
statistical laws such as Zipf's law and Heaps' law, as well as their entropy
and redundancy. To assess how these token-level properties relate to semantic
and acoustic preservation in synthesized speech, we evaluate intelligibility
using error rates of automatic speech recognition, and quality using the UTMOS
score. Our results reveal that NAC tokens, particularly 3-grams, exhibit
language-like statistical patterns. Moreover, these properties, together with
measures of information content, are found to correlate with improved
performances in speech recognition and resynthesis tasks. These findings offer
insights into the structure of NAC token sequences and inform the design of
more effective generative speech models.

TL;DR: This paper highlights challenges in identifying the first error step in student solutions using Large Language Models (LLMs) and proposes an approach that generates intermediate corrected solutions to improve this ability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs excel at solving math word problems, but struggle with meta-reasoning tasks like pinpointing errors in stepwise student solutions.

Method: The authors experimented using error reasoning datasets, VtG and PRM800K, and proposed generating intermediate corrected student solutions to align closer with the original solution to enhance error detection.

Result: State-of-the-art LLMs showed difficulty in locating the first error step, but the intermediate solution generation method demonstrated improved performance.

Conclusion: The paper suggests that generating intermediate corrected solutions can help LLMs better locate errors in student stepwise problem-solving processes.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance on math word
problems, yet they have been shown to struggle with meta-reasoning tasks such
as identifying errors in student solutions. In this work, we investigate the
challenge of locating the first error step in stepwise solutions using two
error reasoning datasets: VtG and PRM800K. Our experiments show that
state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to locate the first error step in student
solutions even when given access to the reference solution. To that end, we
propose an approach that generates an intermediate corrected student solution,
aligning more closely with the original student's solution, which helps improve

TL;DR: Vis-CoT enhances reasoning transparency and reliability by transforming CoT text into visual, interactive graphs, allowing human oversight and achieving up to 24% accuracy improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the opacity in the reasoning process of LLMs during CoT prompting, which complicates verification, debugging, and control in critical use cases.

Method: The method introduces Vis-CoT, a framework that converts linear CoT outputs into reasoning graphs, enabling users to interact with and modify reasoning paths.

Result: Vis-CoT demonstrated up to a 24 percentage point increase in accuracy over traditional CoT approaches on datasets like GSM8K and StrategyQA, along with improved user trust and usability.

Conclusion: Vis-CoT establishes a practical framework for merging LLMs with human oversight to enable transparent, collaborative, and trustworthy reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show strong reasoning via chain-of-thought (CoT)
prompting, but the process is opaque, which makes verification, debugging, and
control difficult in high-stakes settings. We present Vis-CoT, a
human-in-the-loop framework that converts linear CoT text into an interactive
reasoning graph. Users can visualize the logical flow, identify flawed steps,
and intervene by pruning incorrect paths and grafting new, user-defined
premises. This shifts interaction from passive observation to active
collaboration, steering models toward more accurate and trustworthy
conclusions. Across GSM8K and StrategyQA, Vis-CoT improves final-answer
accuracy by up to 24 percentage points over non-interactive baselines. A user
study also shows large gains in perceived usability and trust. Vis-CoT points
to a practical path for more reliable, understandable, and collaborative
reasoning by combining LLMs with targeted human oversight.

### [182] [On the Alignment of Large Language Models with Global Human Opinion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01418)
*Yang Liu,Masahiro Kaneko,Chenhui Chu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study investigates how large language models (LLMs) align with human opinions across countries, languages, and historical periods, revealing alignment disparities and demonstrating effective steering using prompt languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current studies focus on opinion alignment in LLMs within limited demographic scopes, neglecting global, temporal, and language influence aspects. This paper aims to fill that gap.

Method: The researchers created an evaluation framework based on the World Values Survey (WVS). They analyzed LLM opinion alignment globally, across languages and over historical periods, and tested language-based steering techniques.

Result: The study found that LLMs align well with opinions of a few countries but under-align with most others. Changing the prompt’s language to match survey languages improved alignment with the corresponding country’s opinions. LLMs align more with contemporary views.

Conclusion: This is the first comprehensive analysis of how LLMs align with global and historical opinions, showing language as a key steering method for better opinion alignment.

Abstract: Today's large language models (LLMs) are capable of supporting multilingual
scenarios, allowing users to interact with LLMs in their native languages. When
LLMs respond to subjective questions posed by users, they are expected to align
with the views of specific demographic groups or historical periods, shaped by
the language in which the user interacts with the model. Existing studies
mainly focus on researching the opinions represented by LLMs among demographic
groups in the United States or a few countries, lacking worldwide country
samples and studies on human opinions in different historical periods, as well
as lacking discussion on using language to steer LLMs. Moreover, they also
overlook the potential influence of prompt language on the alignment of LLMs'
opinions. In this study, our goal is to fill these gaps. To this end, we create
an evaluation framework based on the World Values Survey (WVS) to
systematically assess the alignment of LLMs with human opinions across
different countries, languages, and historical periods around the world. We
find that LLMs appropriately or over-align the opinions with only a few
countries while under-aligning the opinions with most countries. Furthermore,
changing the language of the prompt to match the language used in the
questionnaire can effectively steer LLMs to align with the opinions of the
corresponding country more effectively than existing steering methods. At the
same time, LLMs are more aligned with the opinions of the contemporary
population. To our knowledge, our study is the first comprehensive
investigation of the topic of opinion alignment in LLMs across global,
language, and temporal dimensions. Our code and data are publicly available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces UniCR, a framework that improves decision reliability for language models, focusing on when to answer and when to abstain to enhance trustworthiness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of ensuring language models can accurately decide when to provide an answer or refuse due to uncertainty, critical for trustworthiness in diverse applications.

Method: The UniCR framework learns a lightweight calibration head and integrates various uncertainty signals, using techniques like conformal risk control and proper scoring to ensure calibrated and principled refusal under specified error budgets.

Result: Experiments show UniCR outperforms traditional and selective baselines on metrics like calibration, risk coverage, and maintaining high coverage even under error constraints, while improving user transparency through informative abstentions.

Conclusion: UniCR offers a general method to enhance model reliability across tasks without fine-tuning, combining evidence fusion, calibrated probabilities, and risk control to handle uncertainty effectively under distribution shifts.

Abstract: Deployed language models must decide not only what to answer but also when
not to answer. We present UniCR, a unified framework that turns heterogeneous
uncertainty evidence including sequence likelihoods, self-consistency
dispersion, retrieval compatibility, and tool or verifier feedback into a
calibrated probability of correctness and then enforces a user-specified error
budget via principled refusal. UniCR learns a lightweight calibration head with
temperature scaling and proper scoring, supports API-only models through
black-box features, and offers distribution-free guarantees using conformal
risk control. For long-form generation, we align confidence with semantic
fidelity by supervising on atomic factuality scores derived from retrieved
evidence, reducing confident hallucinations while preserving coverage.
Experiments on short-form QA, code generation with execution tests, and
retrieval-augmented long-form QA show consistent improvements in calibration
metrics, lower area under the risk-coverage curve, and higher coverage at fixed
risk compared to entropy or logit thresholds, post-hoc calibrators, and
end-to-end selective baselines. Analyses reveal that evidence contradiction,
semantic dispersion, and tool inconsistency are the dominant drivers of
abstention, yielding informative user-facing refusal messages. The result is a
portable recipe of evidence fusion to calibrated probability to risk-controlled
decision that improves trustworthiness without fine-tuning the base model and
remains valid under distribution shift.

*Yuchen Wu,Liang Ding,Li Shen,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents Reason-KE, a novel editing framework for large language models (LLMs) that integrates new knowledge efficiently while being resilient to distractions, achieving new state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static LLMs face challenges in integrating new or emerging facts because retraining is expensive. Current knowledge-editing solutions often fail under noisy or multi-hop conditions.

Method: Reason-KE introduces a reasoning-chain-based editing framework consisting of four structured stages: fact acknowledgment, relevance determination, selective application, and final reasoning, refining knowledge filters in a single pass.

Result: Reason-KE achieves 90.2% accuracy in multi-hop QA on the Qwen2.5-7B model, with minimal performance drops under heavy distraction or leaked answers.

Conclusion: Reason-KE offers an efficient, robust, and effective approach for updating LLM knowledge, setting a new benchmark for resilience and reliability in dynamic knowledge editing.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) encode vast amounts of world knowledge but
remain static once trained, making the timely integration of emerging facts
prohibitively expensive via full retraining. Knowledge-editing techniques have
thus emerged to inject or overwrite specific facts into LLMs, yet they either
over-rely on superficial cues or incur complex, iterative pipelines that
collapse under noisy, multi-hop conditions. We introduce Reason-KE, an
end-to-end reasoning-chain-based editing framework that steers a pretrained LLM
through four structured stages-fact acknowledgment, relevance determination,
selective application, and final reasoning-to filter distractors in a single
pass. Trained on MQuAKE-CF with up to four irrelevant facts, Reason-KE elevates
Qwen2.5-7B's multi-hop QA accuracy to 90.2% while suffering merely a 6.3% drop
under heavy distraction and <1% when answers are leaked. Our quantitative
analysis confirms Reason-KE's resilience and efficiency, establishing a new
state-of-the-art for reliable LLM knowledge updates.

*Youchao Zhou,Heyan Huang,Yicheng Liu,Rui Dai,Xinglin Wang,Xingchen Zhang,Shumin Shi,Yang Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the refusal capabilities of Retrieval-Augmented Language Models (RALMs). It finds that RALMs can show over-refusal behaviors and analyzes how tuning techniques influence this. A simple refusal method is proposed to improve overall model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the refusal capabilities of RALMs, which have not been sufficiently studied, and to address hallucinations in large language models through improved refusal mechanisms.

Method: The paper evaluates RALMs with respect to their calibration in different knowledge states. It examines Refusal-aware Instruction Tuning and In-Context Fine-tuning, as well as factors affecting model refusal behavior.

Result: The study discovers significant over-refusal behavior in RALMs. While In-Context Fine-tuning mitigates this problem, R-tuning exacerbates it. A trade-off is identified between refusal capability and answer quality.

Conclusion: The authors propose a simple method that balances refusal and correct answering ability, providing a nuanced understanding of the factors influencing RALM refusal mechanisms.

Abstract: Existing Large Language Models (LLMs) occasionally generate plausible yet
factually incorrect responses, known as hallucinations. Researchers are
primarily using two approaches to mitigate hallucinations, namely Retrieval
Augmented Language Models (RALMs) and refusal post-training. However, current
research predominantly emphasizes their individual effectiveness while
overlooking the evaluation of the refusal capability of RALMs. In this study,
we ask the fundamental question: Do RALMs know when they don't know?
Specifically, we ask three questions. First, are RALMs well-calibrated
regarding different internal and external knowledge states? We examine the
influence of various factors. Contrary to expectations, we find that LLMs
exhibit significant \textbf{over-refusal} behavior. Then, how does refusal
post-training affect the over-refusal issue? We investigate the Refusal-aware
Instruction Tuning and In-Context Fine-tuning methods. Our results show that
the over-refusal problem is mitigated by In-context fine-tuning. but magnified
by R-tuning. However, we also find that the refusal ability may conflict with
the quality of the answer. Finally, we develop a simple yet effective refusal
method for refusal post-trained models to improve their overall answer quality
in terms of refusal and correct answers. Our study provides a more
comprehensive understanding of the influence of important factors on RALM
systems.

### [186] [MeVe: A Modular System for Memory Verification and Effective Context Control in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01514)
*Andreas Ottem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces MeVe, a modular architecture refining Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems by enhancing context efficiency and accuracy through a five-phase design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address RAG's shortcomings, specifically its inability to filter redundant or irrelevant information effectively during semantic search processes.

Method: The paper implements MeVe, a five-phase modular system that separates retrieval and context composition into independently tunable steps: retrieval, verification, fallback, prioritization, and token budgeting.

Result: MeVe achieves significant efficiency improvements, showing a 57% reduction in context size for Wikipedia data and 75% for HotpotQA compared to traditional RAG setups.

Conclusion: MeVe provides a scalable, reliable architecture for LLMs, offering improved grounding and factual accuracy by refining and distilling contextual content.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems typically face constraints
because of their inherent mechanism: a simple top-k semantic search [1]. The
approach often leads to the incorporation of irrelevant or redundant
information in the context, degrading performance and efficiency [10][11]. This
paper presents MeVe, a novel modular architecture intended for Memory
Verification and smart context composition. MeVe rethinks the RAG paradigm by
proposing a five-phase modular design that distinctly breaks down the retrieval
and context composition process into distinct, auditable, and independently
tunable phases: initial retrieval, relevance verification, fallback retrieval,
context prioritization, and token budgeting. This architecture enables
fine-grained control of what knowledge is made available to an LLM, enabling
task-dependent filtering and adaptation. We release a reference implementation
of MeVe as a proof of concept and evaluate its performance on knowledge-heavy
QA tasks over a subset of English Wikipedia [22]. Our results demonstrate that
by actively verifying information before composition, MeVe significantly
improves context efficiency, achieving a 57% reduction on the Wikipedia dataset
and a 75% reduction on the more complex HotpotQA dataset compared to standard
RAG implementations [25]. This work provides a framework for more scalable and
reliable LLM applications. By refining and distilling contextual information,
MeVe offers a path toward better grounding and more accurate factual support
[16].

### [187] [Service, Solidarity, and Self-Help: A Comparative Topic Modeling Analysis of Community Unionism in the Boot and Shoe Union and Unite Community](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01529)
*Thomas Compton*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper compares community unionism in two different periods (1920s and 2010s-2020s) using advanced NLP techniques and finds significant differences in discourse themes between the two contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze variations in community unionism (CU) discourse across time and organizational settings, focusing on whether the concept has universal applications or evolves contextually.

Method: The study employs BERTopic for thematic modeling, cTF-IDF weighting, and word frequency analysis to examine the discourse of two unions and their alignment with CU principles like coalition-building and grassroots engagement.

Result: Unite Community (2010s-2020s) aligns with outward-facing, social justice themes, while the National Boot and Shoe Union (B&S) from the 1920s focuses on internal administration, industrial relations, and member services.

Conclusion: Community unionism practices differ significantly across historical and organizational boundaries, suggesting its content and priorities are shaped by context rather than being universally uniform.

Abstract: This paper presents a comparative analysis of community unionism (CU) in two
distinct historical and organizational contexts: the National Boot and Shoe
Union (B\&S) in the 1920s and Unite Community in the 2010s--2020s. Using
BERTopic for thematic modeling and cTF-IDF weighting, alongside word frequency
analysis, the study examines the extent to which each union's discourse aligns
with key features of CU -- such as coalition-building, grassroots engagement,
and action beyond the workplace. The results reveal significant differences in
thematic focus and discursive coherence. While Unite Community demonstrates
stronger alignment with outward-facing, social justice-oriented themes, the
B\&S corpus emphasizes internal administration, industrial relations, and
member services -- reflecting a more traditional, servicing-oriented union
model. The analysis also highlights methodological insights, demonstrating how
modern NLP techniques can enhance the study of historical labor archives.
Ultimately, the findings suggest that while both unions engage with
community-related themes, their underlying models of engagement diverge
significantly, challenging assumptions about the continuity and universality of
community unionism across time and sector.

### [188] [CAT: Causal Attention Tuning For Injecting Fine-grained Causal Knowledge into Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01535)
*Kairong Han,Wenshuo Zhao,Ziyu Zhao,JunJian Ye,Lujia Pan,Kun Kuang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces "Causal Attention Tuning" (CAT), a method for training large language models (LLMs) to use causal knowledge effectively, overcoming issues of spurious correlations and out-of-distribution (OOD) performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often capture spurious correlations instead of true causal relationships, resulting in poor performance in OOD settings. Thus, there’s a need to equip LLMs with robust causal reasoning abilities.

Method: The authors propose Causal Attention Tuning (CAT), which uses an automated pipeline to generate token-level causal signals based on human priors. It also introduces a Re-Attention mechanism to guide training, ensuring the focus on causal structures while reducing noise and biases.

Result: Experiments on the Spurious Token Game (STG) benchmark and various tasks show that CAT improves predictive performance, particularly in OOD scenarios, by leveraging causal knowledge more effectively.

Conclusion: CAT demonstrates its ability to enhance LLMs by focusing on true causal structures, offering more robust performance in diverse scenarios, including out-of-distribution cases.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various
domains. However, a fundamental question remains: Can LLMs effectively utilize
causal knowledge for prediction and generation? Through empirical studies, we
find that LLMs trained directly on large-scale data often capture spurious
correlations rather than true causal relationships, leading to suboptimal
performance, especially in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. To address this
challenge, we propose Causal Attention Tuning (CAT), a novel approach that
injects fine-grained causal knowledge into the attention mechanism. We propose
an automated pipeline that leverages human priors to automatically generate
token-level causal signals and introduce the Re-Attention mechanism to guide
training, helping the model focus on causal structures while mitigating noise
and biases in attention scores. Experimental results on our proposed Spurious
Token Game (STG) benchmark and multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that our
approach effectively leverages causal knowledge for prediction and remains
robust in OOD scenarios. Implementation details can be found at

### [189] [In-N-Out: A Parameter-Level API Graph Dataset for Tool Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01560)
*Seungkyu Lee,Nalim Kim,Yohan Jo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of improving LLM-based agents' use of APIs for complex tasks by introducing a structured API graph and a novel dataset called In-N-Out. This approach enhances performance significantly in tasks involving multiple tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable LLM-based agents to execute complex real-world tasks effectively by better understanding and utilizing API dependencies and relationships.

Method: The authors introduced a structured API graph generated from API documentation and built a novel expert-annotated dataset called In-N-Out. They fine-tuned models on this dataset to improve comprehension of API functionality and parameter dependencies.

Result: Using In-N-Out led to a nearly twofold improvement in tool retrieval and compositional API query generation. Models fine-tuned on this dataset achieved 90% of the performance improvement gap.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the significant advantage of using explicit API graphs for tool agents, and the In-N-Out dataset serves as an important resource for advancing this area. The dataset and code will be publicly available.

Abstract: Tool agents -- LLM-based systems that interact with external APIs -- offer a
way to execute real-world tasks. However, as tasks become increasingly complex,
these agents struggle to identify and call the correct APIs in the proper
order. To tackle this problem, we investigate converting API documentation into
a structured API graph that captures API dependencies and leveraging it for
multi-tool queries that require compositional API calls. To support this, we
introduce In-N-Out, the first expert-annotated dataset of API graphs built from
two real-world API benchmarks and their documentation. Using In-N-Out
significantly improves performance on both tool retrieval and multi-tool query
generation, nearly doubling that of LLMs using documentation alone. Moreover,
graphs generated by models fine-tuned on In-N-Out close 90% of this gap,
showing that our dataset helps models learn to comprehend API documentation and
parameter relationships. Our findings highlight the promise of using explicit
API graphs for tool agents and the utility of In-N-Out as a valuable resource.
We will release the dataset and code publicly.

### [190] [Enhancing Uncertainty Estimation in LLMs with Expectation of Aggregated Internal Belief](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01564)
*Zeguan Xiao,Diyang Dou,Boya Xiong,Yun Chen,Guanhua Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EAGLE is introduced as a novel self-evaluation calibration method to improve confidence scores of LLMs by leveraging intermediate hidden layer beliefs instead of final output.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often show overconfidence and generate misleading answers, especially after reinforcement learning from human feedback, which challenges safe deployment and reliable uncertainty estimation.

Method: The method extracts internal beliefs from multiple intermediate layers within LLMs and uses aggregated self-evaluation to refine confidence scores.

Result: Experiments on various datasets and LLMs show EAGLE outperforms existing calibration methods by producing more accurate confidence scores.

Conclusion: EAGLE enhances model calibration, mitigates overconfidence issues in LLMs, and deepens understanding via detailed layer-wise and prompt-based analyses.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide
range of natural language tasks, but often exhibit overconfidence and generate
plausible yet incorrect answers. This overconfidence, especially in models
undergone Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), poses significant
challenges for reliable uncertainty estimation and safe deployment. In this
paper, we propose EAGLE (Expectation of AGgregated internaL bEief), a novel
self-evaluation-based calibration method that leverages the internal hidden
states of LLMs to derive more accurate confidence scores. Instead of relying on
the model's final output, our approach extracts internal beliefs from multiple
intermediate layers during self-evaluation. By aggregating these layer-wise
beliefs and calculating the expectation over the resulting confidence score
distribution, EAGLE produces a refined confidence score that more faithfully
reflects the model's internal certainty. Extensive experiments on diverse
datasets and LLMs demonstrate that EAGLE significantly improves calibration
performance over existing baselines. We also provide an in-depth analysis of
EAGLE, including a layer-wise examination of uncertainty patterns, a study of
the impact of self-evaluation prompts, and an analysis of the effect of
self-evaluation score range.

### [191] [Testing the assumptions about the geometry of sentence embedding spaces: the cosine measure need not apply](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01606)
*Vivi Nastase,Paola Merlo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores the relationship between sentence embeddings' geometrical closeness and their task performance, concluding that geometric proximity is not predictive of task efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether the geometry of sentence embeddings (closeness in embedding space) is indicative of performance in linguistic tasks.

Method: The study computes sentence embeddings using three methods: averaging token embeddings, using the [CLS] token embedding, and leveraging a random token's embedding. Correlations between embedding space distances and task performance are examined.

Result: Cosine similarity reflects superficial commonalities among embeddings but fails to predict task-specific performance. Dimensional weighted combinations encode linguistic information rather than geometry.

Conclusion: Geometrical proximity in sentence embeddings does not reliably map to shared properties or task performance, highlighting shallow utility in examining dimensions independently.

Abstract: Transformer models learn to encode and decode an input text, and produce
contextual token embeddings as a side-effect. The mapping from language into
the embedding space maps words expressing similar concepts onto points that are
close in the space. In practice, the reverse implication is also assumed: words
corresponding to close points in this space are similar or related, those that
are further are not.
  Does closeness in the embedding space extend to shared properties for
sentence embeddings? We present an investigation of sentence embeddings and
show that the geometry of their embedding space is not predictive of their
relative performances on a variety of tasks.
  We compute sentence embeddings in three ways: as averaged token embeddings,
as the embedding of the special [CLS] token, and as the embedding of a random
token from the sentence. We explore whether there is a correlation between the
distance between sentence embedding variations and their performance on
linguistic tasks, and whether despite their distances, they do encode the same
information in the same manner.
  The results show that the cosine similarity -- which treats dimensions
shallowly -- captures (shallow) commonalities or differences between sentence
embeddings, which are not predictive of their performance on specific tasks.
Linguistic information is rather encoded in weighted combinations of different
dimensions, which are not reflected in the geometry of the sentence embedding
space.

### [192] [Benchmarking the Detection of LLMs-Generated Modern Chinese Poetry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01620)
*Shanshan Wang,Junchao Wu,Fengying Ye,Jingming Yao,Lidia S. Chao,Derek F. Wong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmark for detecting AI-generated modern Chinese poetry, revealing that current detectors struggle to reliably differentiate between human and AI-generated poems, especially in terms of style.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-generated modern Chinese poetry disrupts the poetry ecosystem, and current detection tools are ineffective due to the unique features of this poetic form.

Method: The researchers created a dataset of 800 human-written poems and 41,600 AI-generated poems, and evaluated six detection tools for their effectiveness.

Result: Results show that existing detectors fail to consistently identify AI-generated modern Chinese poetry, particularly in detecting intrinsic poetic qualities.

Conclusion: The benchmark validates its necessity, offering foundational insights for advancing detection methods of AI-generated poetry.

Abstract: The rapid development of advanced large language models (LLMs) has made
AI-generated text indistinguishable from human-written text. Previous work on
detecting AI-generated text has made effective progress, but has not involved
modern Chinese poetry. Due to the distinctive characteristics of modern Chinese
poetry, it is difficult to identify whether a poem originated from humans or
AI. The proliferation of AI-generated modern Chinese poetry has significantly
disrupted the poetry ecosystem. Based on the urgency of identifying
AI-generated poetry in the real Chinese world, this paper proposes a novel
benchmark for detecting LLMs-generated modern Chinese poetry. We first
construct a high-quality dataset, which includes both 800 poems written by six
professional poets and 41,600 poems generated by four mainstream LLMs.
Subsequently, we conduct systematic performance assessments of six detectors on
this dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that current detectors cannot be
used as reliable tools to detect modern Chinese poems generated by LLMs. The
most difficult poetic features to detect are intrinsic qualities, especially
style. The detection results verify the effectiveness and necessity of our
proposed benchmark. Our work lays a foundation for future detection of
AI-generated poetry.

*Hind Aljuaid,Areej Alhothali,Ohoud Al-Zamzami,Hussein Assalahi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study introduces TransGAT, an advanced method for Automated Essay Scoring (AES) that combines Transformers and Graph Neural Networks for improved analytic scoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual essay scoring is labor-intensive, inconsistent, and current AES methods struggle with contextual language understanding and overlook specific writing aspects.

Method: TransGAT integrates fine-tuned Transformers with Graph Attention Networks for two-stream scoring: essay-level predictions and token-level insights based on syntactic dependencies.

Result: TransGAT achieved superior performance on the ELLIPSE dataset, with an average Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) of 0.854 across various scoring dimensions.

Conclusion: TransGAT demonstrates the capability to enhance AES systems, addressing key limitations and achieving analytic scoring excellence.

Abstract: Essay writing is a critical component of student assessment, yet manual
scoring is labor-intensive and inconsistent. Automated Essay Scoring (AES)
offers a promising alternative, but current approaches face limitations. Recent
studies have incorporated Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) into AES using static
word embeddings that fail to capture contextual meaning, especially for
polysemous words. Additionally, many methods rely on holistic scoring,
overlooking specific writing aspects such as grammar, vocabulary, and cohesion.
To address these challenges, this study proposes TransGAT, a novel approach
that integrates fine-tuned Transformer models with GNNs for analytic scoring.
TransGAT combines the contextual understanding of Transformers with the
relational modeling strength of Graph Attention Networks (GAT). It performs
two-stream predictions by pairing each fine-tuned Transformer (BERT, RoBERTa,
and DeBERTaV3) with a separate GAT. In each pair, the first stream generates
essay-level predictions, while the second applies GAT to Transformer token
embeddings, with edges constructed from syntactic dependencies. The model then
fuses predictions from both streams to produce the final analytic score.
Experiments on the ELLIPSE dataset show that TransGAT outperforms baseline
models, achieving an average Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) of 0.854 across all
analytic scoring dimensions. These findings highlight the potential of TransGAT
to advance AES systems.

*Dominic Plein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a phonetic word similarity computation method using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, implemented and parallelized in Rust, with applications in language phonetic analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a method to efficiently calculate similarity between words based on their pronunciation to analyze phonetic structures.

Method: The approach uses the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, implemented in Rust and parallelized on CPU and GPU with CUDA and cudarc, followed by graph construction and clustering of phonetic similarity.

Result: The method successfully constructs a phonetically-based graph and demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of analyzing phonetic language structures.

Conclusion: The proposed method opens avenues for analyzing phonetic structures and can be expanded for broader linguistic applications across languages.

Abstract: We present a method to calculate the similarity between words based on their
phonetic transcription (their pronunciation) using the Needleman-Wunsch
algorithm. We implement this algorithm in Rust and parallelize it on both CPU
and GPU to handle large datasets efficiently. The GPU implementation leverages
CUDA and the cudarc Rust library to achieve significant performance
improvements. We validate our approach by constructing a fully-connected graph
where nodes represent words and edges have weights according to the similarity
between the words. This graph is then analyzed using clustering algorithms to
identify groups of phonetically similar words. Our results demonstrate the
feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method in analyzing the phonetic
structure of languages. It might be easily expanded to other languages.

### [195] [Bridging Thoughts and Words: Graph-Based Intent-Semantic Joint Learning for Fake News Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01660)
*Zhengjia Wang,Qiang Sheng,Danding Wang,Beizhe Hu,Juan Cao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach for detecting fake news by incorporating intent analysis alongside semantic cues, using graph-based modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fake news detection methods relying on semantic clues fail in dynamic environments, limiting their effectiveness. There is a need for understanding deeper intentions behind news deception.

Method: The authors propose InSide, a Graph-based Intent-Semantic Joint Modeling approach, to fuse semantic and intent signals using heterogeneous graph structures. They further employ a dynamic pathway-based graph alignment strategy for better integration.

Result: Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets show that InSide outperforms state-of-the-art methods in fake news detection.

Conclusion: Integrating intent signals with semantic clues using graph-based modeling improves fake news detection performance and builds a deeper understanding of deception mechanics.

Abstract: Fake news detection is an important and challenging task for defending online
information integrity. Existing state-of-the-art approaches typically extract
news semantic clues, such as writing patterns that include emotional words,
stylistic features, etc. However, detectors tuned solely to such semantic clues
can easily fall into surface detection patterns, which can shift rapidly in
dynamic environments, leading to limited performance in the evolving news
landscape. To address this issue, this paper investigates a novel perspective
by incorporating news intent into fake news detection, bridging intents and
semantics together. The core insight is that by considering news intents, one
can deeply understand the inherent thoughts behind news deception, rather than
the surface patterns within words alone. To achieve this goal, we propose
Graph-based Intent-Semantic Joint Modeling (InSide) for fake news detection,
which models deception clues from both semantic and intent signals via
graph-based joint learning. Specifically, InSide reformulates news semantic and
intent signals into heterogeneous graph structures, enabling long-range context
interaction through entity guidance and capturing both holistic and
implementation-level intent via coarse-to-fine intent modeling. To achieve
better alignment between semantics and intents, we further develop a dynamic
pathway-based graph alignment strategy for effective message passing and
aggregation across these signals by establishing a common space. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed InSide compared to state-of-the-art methods.

*Abdelkrime Aries*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces chDzDT, a character-level pre-trained language model designed for Algerian dialect, addressing challenges like complex morphology and code-switching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap due to limited NLP models for the Algerian dialect, which is challenging due to its complex morphology, code-switching, and multilingual scripts.

Method: They created a character-level pre-trained language model (chDzDT) trained on isolated words using a dataset from diverse sources, enabling the model to focus on morphological patterns rather than token sequences.

Result: The chDzDT model effectively encoded Algerian morphology and performed well in downstream tasks while addressing the challenges of low-resource dialect modeling.

Conclusion: Character-level modeling is effective for morphologically rich, low-resource dialects, opening pathways for more inclusive and adaptable NLP systems.

Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have substantially advanced natural
language processing by providing context-sensitive text representations.
However, the Algerian dialect remains under-represented, with few dedicated
models available. Processing this dialect is challenging due to its complex
morphology, frequent code-switching, multiple scripts, and strong lexical
influences from other languages. These characteristics complicate tokenization
and reduce the effectiveness of conventional word- or subword-level approaches.
  To address this gap, we introduce chDzDT, a character-level pre-trained
language model tailored for Algerian morphology. Unlike conventional PLMs that
rely on token sequences, chDzDT is trained on isolated words. This design
allows the model to encode morphological patterns robustly, without depending
on token boundaries or standardized orthography. The training corpus draws from
diverse sources, including YouTube comments, French, English, and Berber
Wikipedia, as well as the Tatoeba project. It covers multiple scripts and
linguistic varieties, resulting in a substantial pre-training workload.
  Our contributions are threefold: (i) a detailed morphological analysis of
Algerian dialect using YouTube comments; (ii) the construction of a
multilingual Algerian lexicon dataset; and (iii) the development and extensive
evaluation of a character-level PLM as a morphology-focused encoder for
downstream tasks. The proposed approach demonstrates the potential of
character-level modeling for morphologically rich, low-resource dialects and
lays a foundation for more inclusive and adaptable NLP systems.

### [197] [Flaw or Artifact? Rethinking Prompt Sensitivity in Evaluating LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01790)
*Andong Hua,Kenan Tang,Chenhe Gu,Jindong Gu,Eric Wong,Yao Qin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper argues that prompt sensitivity in large language models (LLMs) is largely an artifact of existing evaluation methods rather than an inherent limitation of the models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt sensitivity has been widely criticized as a major limitation of LLMs, but the accuracy and origin of this issue remain underexplored, particularly regarding whether it stems from the models themselves or the evaluation methods used.

Method: The authors conducted a systematic evaluation of 7 LLMs across 6 benchmarks, covering multiple-choice and open-ended tasks using 12 diverse prompt templates, and compared heuristic and LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation methods.

Result: The study found that heuristic evaluation methods lead to incorrect perceptions of high prompt sensitivity due to their inability to account for semantically correct alternative phrasings. Using LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations resulted in reduced performance variance and more consistent model rankings.

Conclusion: Modern LLMs are more robust to prompt phrasing variability than previously believed, and prompt sensitivity issues are largely caused by flawed evaluation methods rather than the inherent capabilities of the models.

Abstract: Prompt sensitivity, referring to the phenomenon where paraphrasing (i.e.,
repeating something written or spoken using different words) leads to
significant changes in large language model (LLM) performance, has been widely
accepted as a core limitation of LLMs. In this work, we revisit this issue and
ask: Is the widely reported high prompt sensitivity truly an inherent weakness
of LLMs, or is it largely an artifact of evaluation processes? To answer this
question, we systematically evaluate 7 LLMs (e.g., GPT and Gemini family)
across 6 benchmarks, including both multiple-choice and open-ended tasks on 12
diverse prompt templates. We find that much of the prompt sensitivity stems
from heuristic evaluation methods, including log-likelihood scoring and rigid
answer matching, which often overlook semantically correct responses expressed
through alternative phrasings, such as synonyms or paraphrases. When we adopt
LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations, we observe a substantial reduction in performance
variance and a consistently higher correlation in model rankings across
prompts. Our findings suggest that modern LLMs are more robust to prompt
templates than previously believed, and that prompt sensitivity may be more an
artifact of evaluation than a flaw in the models.

TL;DR: The paper explores the effectiveness and limitations of AI interviewers compared to Interactive Voice Response systems for data collection in research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess AI interviewers' readiness and suitability for quantitative and qualitative data collection by comparing them to IVR systems.

Method: The study evaluates AI interviewers on input/output performance (speech recognition, recording, emotion handling) and verbal reasoning (ability to probe, clarify, handle logic).

Result: Field studies show that AI interviewers outperform IVR systems, but face limitations like transcription errors, weak emotional detection, and inconsistent follow-up.

Conclusion: Current AI interviewer technology is promising but context-dependent, especially for qualitative research, due to its limitations in handling certain data collection nuances.

Abstract: Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have paved the way for "AI
interviewers" that can administer voice-based surveys with respondents in
real-time. This position paper reviews emerging evidence to understand when
such AI interviewing systems are fit for purpose for collecting data within
quantitative and qualitative research contexts. We evaluate the capabilities of
AI interviewers as well as current Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems
across two dimensions: input/output performance (i.e., speech recognition,
answer recording, emotion handling) and verbal reasoning (i.e., ability to
probe, clarify, and handle branching logic). Field studies suggest that AI
interviewers already exceed IVR capabilities for both quantitative and
qualitative data collection, but real-time transcription error rates, limited
emotion detection abilities, and uneven follow-up quality indicate that the
utility, use and adoption of current AI interviewer technology may be
context-dependent for qualitative data collection efforts.

*Zhimeng Luo,Abhibha Gupta,Adam Frisch,Daqing He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel method to extract the OPQRST assessment from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) using Large Language Models (LLMs), reframing the task from sequence labeling to text generation for better interpretability and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extracting critical patient information from EHRs is challenging due to their unstructured and complex nature. Traditional machine learning approaches lack efficiency in capturing relevant details effectively for clinical use.

Method: The task of extracting OPQRST assessment is reframed as a text generation problem instead of sequence labeling by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). The method includes reasoning steps and integrates semantic similarity measures like BERT Score for enhanced evaluation.

Result: The paper demonstrates improved accuracy and usability for extracting critical patient information from EHRs, showing LLMs' potential to align generated text with clinical intent via semantic similarity measures.

Conclusion: This approach offers a scalable and interpretable solution for better information extraction from EHRs, assisting clinicians in decision-making and improving patient care outcomes.

Abstract: The extraction of critical patient information from Electronic Health Records
(EHRs) poses significant challenges due to the complexity and unstructured
nature of the data. Traditional machine learning approaches often fail to
capture pertinent details efficiently, making it difficult for clinicians to
utilize these tools effectively in patient care. This paper introduces a novel
approach to extracting the OPQRST assessment from EHRs by leveraging the
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). We propose to reframe the task
from sequence labeling to text generation, enabling the models to provide
reasoning steps that mimic a physician's cognitive processes. This approach
enhances interpretability and adapts to the limited availability of labeled
data in healthcare settings. Furthermore, we address the challenge of
evaluating the accuracy of machine-generated text in clinical contexts by
proposing a modification to traditional Named Entity Recognition (NER) metrics.
This includes the integration of semantic similarity measures, such as the BERT
Score, to assess the alignment between generated text and the clinical intent
of the original records. Our contributions demonstrate a significant
advancement in the use of AI in healthcare, offering a scalable solution that
improves the accuracy and usability of information extraction from EHRs,
thereby aiding clinicians in making more informed decisions and enhancing
patient care outcomes.

*Zhimeng Luo,Zhendong Wang,Rui Meng,Diyang Xue,Adam Frisch,Daqing He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a methodology to extract and link entities in chief complaint records without human annotation, using weak supervision and a BERT-based model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chief complaint records are inconsistent in medical notations, making it hard to standardize them for record-keeping and text mining. This study aims to derive a method to handle this issue effectively and automatically.

Method: The authors utilize a split-and-match algorithm to generate weak annotations on entity spans and class labels, training a BERT-based model on 1.2 million de-identified records to match entities to a predefined ontology.

Result: Experiments reveal that the proposed method, Weakly Supervised Entity Extraction and Linking, outperforms previous techniques in extracting and linking entities without the need for human labeling.

Conclusion: The methodology successfully automates and standardizes chief complaint entity handling, making it a valuable tool for medical data management without requiring human-generated annotations.

Abstract: A Chief complaint (CC) is the reason for the medical visit as stated in the
patient's own words. It helps medical professionals to quickly understand a
patient's situation, and also serves as a short summary for medical text
mining. However, chief complaint records often take a variety of entering
methods, resulting in a wide variation of medical notations, which makes it
difficult to standardize across different medical institutions for record
keeping or text mining. In this study, we propose a weakly supervised method to
automatically extract and link entities in chief complaints in the absence of
human annotation. We first adopt a split-and-match algorithm to produce weak
annotations, including entity mention spans and class labels, on 1.2 million
real-world de-identified and IRB approved chief complaint records. Then we
train a BERT-based model with generated weak labels to locate entity mentions
in chief complaint text and link them to a pre-defined ontology. We conducted
extensive experiments, and the results showed that our Weakly Supervised Entity
Extraction and Linking (\ours) method produced superior performance over
previous methods without any human annotation.

### [201] [DRAssist: Dispute Resolution Assistance using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01962)
*Sachin Pawar,Manoj Apte,Girish K. Palshikar,Basit Ali,Nitin Ramrakhiyani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores using large language models (LLMs) to assist human judges in resolving disputes. The approach focuses on summarizing disputes into structured formats and using LLMs for decision-making tasks in automobile insurance and domain name disputes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance dispute resolution processes (e.g., in consumer courts) by leveraging LLMs' capabilities to identify key elements, summarize disputes, and assist judges in making fair decisions.

Method: The DRAssist system is designed to: 1) identify structural components of disputes, 2) summarize unstructured descriptions into structured summaries, and 3) use LLMs prompted at three levels (stronger party, demand acceptance, argument evaluation). The paper tests multiple LLM prompting strategies and evaluates their effectiveness in two specific domains.

Result: The LLMs' performance was evaluated using tailored metrics, and they showed promise in resolving disputes through structured summaries and decision-support tasks.

Conclusion: LLMs can proficiently assist in dispute resolution by summarizing cases and analyzing disputes at different levels, suggesting potential to augment human judges' decision-making capabilities in specific domains.

Abstract: Disputes between two parties occur in almost all domains such as taxation,
insurance, banking, healthcare, etc. The disputes are generally resolved in a
specific forum (e.g., consumer court) where facts are presented, points of
disagreement are discussed, arguments as well as specific demands of the
parties are heard, and finally a human judge resolves the dispute by often
favouring one of the two parties. In this paper, we explore the use of large
language models (LLMs) as assistants for the human judge to resolve such
disputes, as part of our DRAssist system. We focus on disputes from two
specific domains -- automobile insurance and domain name disputes. DRAssist
identifies certain key structural elements (e.g., facts, aspects or
disagreement, arguments) of the disputes and summarizes the unstructured
dispute descriptions to produce a structured summary for each dispute. We then
explore multiple prompting strategies with multiple LLMs for their ability to
assist in resolving the disputes in these domains. In DRAssist, these LLMs are
prompted to produce the resolution output at three different levels -- (i)
identifying an overall stronger party in a dispute, (ii) decide whether each
specific demand of each contesting party can be accepted or not, (iii) evaluate
whether each argument by each contesting party is strong or weak. We evaluate
the performance of LLMs on all these tasks by comparing them with relevant
baselines using suitable evaluation metrics.

### [202] [StructCoh: Structured Contrastive Learning for Context-Aware Text Semantic Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02033)
*Chao Xue,Ziyuan Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: StructCoh is a graph-enhanced contrastive learning framework for text semantic matching that combines structural reasoning with representation optimization, achieving significant improvements in legal and plagiarism detection datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-trained language models struggle with capturing hierarchical structural patterns and fine-grained semantic distinctions in text semantic matching, prompting the need for a more nuanced approach.

Method: StructCoh employs a dual-graph encoder that uses dependency parsing and topic modeling to construct semantic graphs. Graph isomorphism networks propagate structural features, while a hierarchical contrastive objective enforces consistency across node and graph levels.

Result: StructCoh demonstrated significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, achieving an 86.7% F1-score (+6.2% absolute gain) in legal statute matching, excelling in identifying argument structure similarities.

Conclusion: The proposed StructCoh framework effectively combines structural reasoning and contrastive learning to address semantic matching challenges, proving its efficacy on diverse datasets and achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Text semantic matching requires nuanced understanding of both structural
relationships and fine-grained semantic distinctions. While pre-trained
language models excel at capturing token-level interactions, they often
overlook hierarchical structural patterns and struggle with subtle semantic
discrimination. In this paper, we proposed StructCoh, a graph-enhanced
contrastive learning framework that synergistically combines structural
reasoning with representation space optimization. Our approach features two key
innovations: (1) A dual-graph encoder constructs semantic graphs via dependency
parsing and topic modeling, then employs graph isomorphism networks to
propagate structural features across syntactic dependencies and cross-document
concept nodes. (2) A hierarchical contrastive objective enforces consistency at
multiple granularities: node-level contrastive regularization preserves core
semantic units, while graph-aware contrastive learning aligns inter-document
structural semantics through both explicit and implicit negative sampling
strategies. Experiments on three legal document matching benchmarks and
academic plagiarism detection datasets demonstrate significant improvements
over state-of-the-art methods. Notably, StructCoh achieves 86.7% F1-score
(+6.2% absolute gain) on legal statute matching by effectively identifying
argument structure similarities.

TL;DR: The study evaluated four state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on their ability to analyze longitudinal dental case vignettes and found DeepSeek as the best performer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the ability of LLMs to interpret longitudinal patient narratives in dentistry, leveraging structured clinical data for rigorous evaluation.

Method: The authors tested four LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash, Copilot, and DeepSeek V3) using 34 standardized periodontal cases (258 QA pairs), measuring performance through automated metrics and blinded evaluations by licensed dentists.

Result: DeepSeek outperformed other models, achieving superior faithfulness (median score = 0.528) and higher expert ratings (4.5/5), without compromising readability.

Conclusion: DeepSeek stands as the leading LLM for dental case analysis, with potential applications in medical education, research, and as a domain-specific tool.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold transformative potential in healthcare, yet
their capacity to interpret longitudinal patient narratives remains
inadequately explored. Dentistry, with its rich repository of structured
clinical data, presents a unique opportunity to rigorously assess LLMs'
reasoning abilities. While several commercial LLMs already exist, DeepSeek, a
model that gained significant attention earlier this year, has also joined the
competition. This study evaluated four state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini
2.0 Flash, Copilot, and DeepSeek V3) on their ability to analyze longitudinal
dental case vignettes through open-ended clinical tasks. Using 34 standardized
longitudinal periodontal cases (comprising 258 question-answer pairs), we
assessed model performance via automated metrics and blinded evaluations by
licensed dentists. DeepSeek emerged as the top performer, demonstrating
superior faithfulness (median score = 0.528 vs. 0.367-0.457) and higher expert
ratings (median = 4.5/5 vs. 4.0/5), without significantly compromising
readability. Our study positions DeepSeek as the leading LLM for case analysis,
endorses its integration as an adjunct tool in both medical education and
research, and highlights its potential as a domain-specific agent.

*Guangzeng Han,Weisi Liu,Xiaolei Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Genetic Prompt, a framework that uses genetic algorithms and LLMs to generate diverse and high-quality synthetic data for NLP tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Synthetic data from LLMs often lacks diversity and quality, limiting its applicability for real-world scenarios.

Method: The framework combines genetic algorithms with LLMs, treating text attributes as gene sequences, and employs crossover, mutation, and an active learning scheme for parent selection.

Result: Experiments show Genetic Prompt outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks, scales well, and enhances downstream model performance, especially in imbalanced data scenarios.

Conclusion: Genetic Prompt effectively generates high-quality and diverse synthetic data that improves NLP model robustness and performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at generating synthetic data, but ensuring
its quality and diversity remains challenging. We propose Genetic Prompt, a
novel framework that combines genetic algorithms with LLMs to augment synthetic
data generation. Our approach treats semantic text attributes as gene sequences
and leverages the LLM to simulate crossover and mutation operations. This
genetic process enhances data quality and diversity by creating novel attribute
combinations, yielding synthetic distributions closer to real-world data. To
optimize parent selection, we also integrate an active learning scheme that
expands the offspring search space. Our experiments on multiple NLP tasks
reveal several key findings: Genetic Prompt not only significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines but also shows robust performance across various
generator model sizes and scales. Moreover, we demonstrate that fusing our
synthetic data with the original training set significantly boosts downstream
model performance, particularly for class-imbalanced scenarios. Our findings
validate that Genetic Prompt is an effective method for producing high-quality
synthetic data for a wide range of NLP applications.

*Elisabetta Rocchetti,Alfio Ferrara*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate text with precise length constraints and compares foundation models with instruction-tuned models in English and Italian.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to assess how instruction-tuning impacts the effectiveness of LLMs in handling length-controlled text generation across different languages.

Method: The study evaluates performance and internal contributions through Cumulative Weighted Attribution, a metric based on Direct Logit Attribution, analyzing deep layers of models.

Result: Instruction-tuning enhances length control by specializing components in deeper model layers. In English, late-layer attention heads contribute positively, while in Italian, final-layer MLPs offer compensations.

Conclusion: Instruction-tuning reconfigures deeper model layers to improve adherence to task-specific requirements, with component-level strategies adapting to different linguistic contexts.

Abstract: Adhering to explicit length constraints, such as generating text with a
precise word count, remains a significant challenge for Large Language Models
(LLMs). This study aims at investigating the differences between foundation
models and their instruction-tuned counterparts, on length-controlled text
generation in English and Italian. We analyze both performance and internal
component contributions using Cumulative Weighted Attribution, a metric derived
from Direct Logit Attribution. Our findings reveal that instruction-tuning
substantially improves length control, primarily by specializing components in
deeper model layers. Specifically, attention heads in later layers of IT models
show increasingly positive contributions, particularly in English. In Italian,
while attention contributions are more attenuated, final-layer MLPs exhibit a
stronger positive role, suggesting a compensatory mechanism. These results
indicate that instruction-tuning reconfigures later layers for task adherence,
with component-level strategies potentially adapting to linguistic context.

*Juhyeon Lee,Wonduk Seo,Hyunjin An,Seunghyun Lee,Yi Bu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Contrastive Reasoning Prompt Optimization (CRPO), a framework to enhance prompt generation in Large Language Models (LLMs) using contrastive reasoning and retrieval-augmented strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy and utility of prompts for LLMs by leveraging their reasoning capabilities, especially by analyzing contrasting examples, instead of relying solely on prompt refinement or fine-tuning.

Method: The proposed CRPO framework retrieves top k reference prompts from the HelpSteer2 dataset and employs two strategies: (1) Tiered contrastive reasoning, comparing prompts of varying quality tiers for reflective reasoning, and (2) Multi-metric contrastive reasoning, analyzing high-performing prompts across multiple evaluation dimensions to integrate their strengths into optimized prompts.

Result: Experimental results on the HelpSteer2 benchmark show that CRPO significantly outperforms baseline methods, demonstrating its effectiveness for prompt optimization.

Conclusion: CRPO highlights the potential of contrastive, retrieval-augmented reasoning in enhancing prompt optimization, making it both robust and interpretable. The approach shows promise for further advancements in the field.

Abstract: Automatic prompt optimization has recently emerged as a strategy for
improving the quality of prompts used in Large Language Models (LLMs), with the
goal of generating more accurate and useful responses. However, most prior work
focuses on direct prompt refinement or model fine-tuning, overlooking the
potential of leveraging LLMs' inherent reasoning capability to learn from
contrasting examples. In this paper, we present Contrastive Reasoning Prompt
Optimization (CRPO), a novel framework that formulates prompt optimization as a
retrieval augmented reasoning process. Our approach retrieves top k reference
prompts from the HelpSteer2 dataset, an open-source collection annotated for
helpfulness, correctness, coherence, complexity, and verbosity, and constructs
two complementary optimization paradigms: (1) tiered contrastive reasoning,
where the LLM compares high, medium, and low quality prompts to refine its own
generation through reflective reasoning, and (2) multi-metric contrastive
reasoning, where the LLM analyzes the best prompts along each evaluation
dimension and integrates their strengths into an optimized prompt. By
explicitly contrasting high and low quality exemplars, CRPO enables the model
to deduce why certain prompts succeed while others fail, thereby achieving more
robust and interpretable optimization. Experimental results on the HelpSteer2
benchmark demonstrate that CRPO significantly outperforms baselines. Our
findings highlight the promise of contrastive, retrieval-augmented reasoning
for advancing automatic prompt optimization.

*Zhichao Shi,Xuhui Jiang,Chengjin Xu,Cangli Yao,Zhenxin Huang,Shengjie Ma,Yinghan Shen,Yuanzhuo Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces JudgeAgent, a dynamic evaluation framework for Large Language Models (LLMs) that overcomes limitations of traditional evaluation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate LLMs with higher precision, overcoming challenges like insufficient interaction, difficulty control, and verification issues in existing paradigms.

Method: Introducing JudgeAgent, an interviewer-style framework, combining benchmark grading, interactive extension, and feedback-based analysis. It employs knowledge-driven data synthesis and adaptive difficulty adjustment.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of JudgeAgent in accurately gauging LLM capabilities and validating evaluation methods.

Conclusion: JudgeAgent provides a robust framework for dynamic, adaptive, and accurate performance evaluation of LLMs compared to traditional approaches.

Abstract: Evaluating the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) is an essential
step to ensure the successful application of LLMs across various domains. The
current evaluation of LLMs is based on a paradigm that involves querying them
with predefined question sets and assessing their outputs. This paradigm offers
controllable processes and simplicity, but faces challenges such as limited
interaction with targets, insufficient difficulty control, and difficulties in
verifying the validity of evaluation results, making it hard to precisely
determine the knowledge and capability boundaries of target models. To address
these challenges, we propose JudgeAgent, a knowledge-target adaptive dynamic
evaluation framework based on a new interviewer-style evaluation paradigm.
JudgeAgent employs a comprehensive evaluation approach consisting of benchmark
grading, interactive extension, and evaluation feedback. It utilizes
knowledge-driven data synthesis and target-adaptive difficulty adjustment
methods to conduct extended testing, providing accurate and effective
evaluation results. We also introduce a novel insight into validating
evaluation methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of JudgeAgent and its
dynamic evaluation paradigm through extensive experiments.

### [209] [CMRAG: Co-modality-based document retrieval and visual question answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02123)
*Wang Chen,Guanqiang Qi,Weikang Li,Yang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a co-modality-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (CMRAG) framework that utilizes both text and images for enhanced document question answering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods in document question answering struggle with multimodal documents as they either over-rely on text or visuals, failing to integrate the advantages of both effectively.

Method: The proposed CMRAG approach first parses documents to create co-modality representations of text and images. Using these representations, it retrieves evidence from text and images independently and integrates them at a cross-modal level before generating a response using visual language models (VLMs).

Result: Experiments reveal that CMRAG significantly improves the performance over methods relying solely on vision-based RAG for visual document question answering.

Conclusion: Integrating co-modality information in a unified Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework effectively enhances the accuracy and quality of answers in complex visual document question answering tasks.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a core paradigm in document
question answering tasks. However, existing methods have limitations when
dealing with multimodal documents: one category of methods relies on layout
analysis and text extraction, which can only utilize explicit text information
and struggle to capture images or unstructured content; the other category
treats document segmentation as visual input and directly passes it to visual
language models (VLMs) for processing, yet it ignores the semantic advantages
of text, leading to suboptimal generation results. This paper proposes
co-modality-based RAG (CMRAG), which can simultaneously leverage text and
images for efficient retrieval and generation. Specifically, we first perform
structured parsing on documents to obtain co-modality representations of text
segments and image regions. Subsequently, in response to user queries, we
retrieve candidate evidence from text and image channels, respectively, and
aggregate the results at the cross-modal retrieval level. Finally, we prompt
the VLM to generate the final response based on the co-modality retrieval
results. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
pure-vision-based RAG in visual document question answering tasks. The findings
of this paper show that integrating co-modality information into the RAG
framework in a unified manner is an effective approach to improving the
performance of complex document visual question-answering (VQA) systems.

*Snehasis Mukhopadhyay,Aryan Kasat,Shivam Dubey,Rahul Karthikeyan,Dhruv Sood,Vinija Jain,Aman Chadha,Amitava Das*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces AMBEDKAR, a framework that mitigates caste and religious biases in Indian context present in Large Language Models (LLMs). It employs a Constitution-Aware Decoding Layer inspired by Dr. B. R. Ambedkar's principles, achieving significant bias reduction without retraining base models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often inherit societal biases, which can lead to harmful outputs, particularly in the Indian context related to caste and religion. Existing methods fail to address these biases adequately due to their Western-centric focus.

Method: The framework uses a Constitution-Aware Decoding Layer that applies bias mitigation during inference without affecting base model parameters. It incorporates speculative decoding, where a Small Language Model generates outputs and a constitutionally guided LLM verifies them for fairness.

Result: The approach achieves an absolute reduction of bias up to 26.41 percent compared to baseline, demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing casteist and communal bias.

Conclusion: AMBEDKAR provides an efficient and cost-effective solution for bias mitigation in LLMs, ensuring fairness, neutrality, and inclusivity in outputs tailored for the Indian context. The framework can be integrated without retraining models, thus reducing implementation barriers.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can inadvertently reflect societal biases
present in their training data, leading to harmful or prejudiced outputs. In
the Indian context, our empirical evaluations across a suite of models reveal
that biases around caste and religion are particularly salient. Yet, most
existing mitigation strategies are Western-centric and fail to address these
local nuances. We propose AMBEDKAR, a framework inspired by the egalitarian
vision of Dr B. R. Ambedkar, architect of the Indian Constitution, to guide LLM
outputs toward fairness, neutrality, and inclusion in line with Articles 14 to
17. Our approach introduces a Constitution-Aware Decoding Layer, guided by the
AI Constitution of India and applied only at inference time, without any
parameter updates to the base model. We incorporate a speculative decoding
algorithm that proactively reduces casteist and communal bias during
generation. This mitigation layer operates directly within the decoding
process, avoiding changes to model internals and lowering the computational and
infrastructural costs associated with retraining. We reinterpret speculative
decoding not merely as an efficiency tool but as a mechanism for fairness. In
this framework, a Small Language Model (SLM) acts as a potentially biased
generator, while a constitutionally guided Large Language Model (LLM) serves as
the verifier. Rather than accelerating generation, the LLM enforces bias-robust
trajectories in the SLM outputs. This inversion of roles gives rise to a
fairness-by-speculation paradigm. Our approach yields an absolute reduction of
bias up to 26.41 percent compared to baseline. Our source code, datasets, and
results are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/AMBEDKAR-983B/

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores using small decoder LMs with meta-learning for NER tasks in low-resource languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of training NER models for low-resource languages in memory- or latency-constrained settings.

Method: Utilize first-order MAML during pretraining and evaluate on languages like Tagalog and Cebuano.

Result: MAML improved zero-shot micro-F1 scores by 2-6 pp under head-only tuning, 1-3 pp after full tuning, and reduced convergence time by up to 8%.

Conclusion: Meta-learning and surface anchors like specific language markers are crucial for effective zero-shot and fast adaptation in low-resource language NER.

Abstract: Named-entity recognition (NER) in low-resource languages is usually tackled
by finetuning very large multilingual LMs, an option that is often infeasible
in memory- or latency-constrained settings. We ask whether small decoder LMs
can be pretrained so that they adapt quickly and transfer zero-shot to
languages unseen during pretraining. To this end we replace part of the
autoregressive objective with first-order model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML).
Tagalog and Cebuano are typologically similar yet structurally different in
their actor/non-actor voice systems, and hence serve as a challenging test-bed.
Across four model sizes (11 M - 570 M) MAML lifts zero-shot micro-F1 by 2-6 pp
under head-only tuning and 1-3 pp after full tuning, while cutting convergence
time by up to 8%. Gains are largest for single-token person entities that
co-occur with Tagalog case particles si/ni, highlighting the importance of
surface anchors.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Avoidance Decoding, a strategy to enhance creative diversity in outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs). It penalizes similarities between outputs to encourage novel story generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often create repetitive and monotonous outputs, limiting creative diversity, particularly in story generation tasks.

Method: The strategy employs an adaptive penalty system adjusting token logits based on two similarity measures: Concept-level Similarity for initial diversity and Narrative-level Similarity for plot development.

Result: Avoidance Decoding achieved up to 2.6x higher diversity and reduced repetition by 30%, outperforming baselines and activating wider model creativity with broader neuron engagement.

Conclusion: The proposed method significantly improves diversity and creativity in LLM outputs while mitigating issues of text degeneration, leveraging the model's inherent capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate repetitive and monotonous
outputs, especially in tasks like story generation, due to limited creative
diversity when given the same input prompt. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel decoding strategy, Avoidance Decoding, that modifies token
logits by penalizing similarity to previously generated outputs, thereby
encouraging more diverse multi-branch stories. This penalty adaptively balances
two similarity measures: (1) Concept-level Similarity Penalty, which is
prioritized in early stages to diversify initial story concepts, and (2)
Narrative-level Similarity Penalty, which is increasingly emphasized later to
ensure natural yet diverse plot development. Notably, our method achieves up to
2.6 times higher output diversity and reduces repetition by an average of 30%
compared to strong baselines, while effectively mitigating text degeneration.
Furthermore, we reveal that our method activates a broader range of neurons,
demonstrating that it leverages the model's intrinsic creativity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models often struggle with factual accuracy in specialized domains like medicine, necessitating reliable benchmarks and tools for hallucination mitigation.

Method: The authors propose a benchmark called FActBench and employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting and Natural Language Inference (NLI) for fact-checking against domain-specific tasks.

Result: Unanimous voting using the fact-checking techniques demonstrated strong correlation with evaluations made by domain experts.

Conclusion: The benchmark and methodology outlined in the paper are effective at improving and evaluating the factuality of LLMs in specialized domains like medicine.

Abstract: Large Language Models tend to struggle when dealing with specialized domains.
While all aspects of evaluation hold importance, factuality is the most
critical one. Similarly, reliable fact-checking tools and data sources are
essential for hallucination mitigation. We address these issues by providing a
comprehensive Fact-checking Benchmark FActBench covering four generation tasks
and six state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) for the Medical domain.
We use two state-of-the-art Fact-checking techniques: Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
Prompting and Natural Language Inference (NLI). Our experiments show that the
fact-checking scores acquired through the Unanimous Voting of both techniques
correlate best with Domain Expert Evaluation.

*Jaime Collado-Montañez,L. Alfonso Ureña-López,Arturo Montejo-Ráez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Fundamental Language Model (FLM) paradigm, arguing for smaller, linguistically competent models supplemented by external tools for factual retrieval, as opposed to monolithic models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of large language models, such as hallucinations, biases, privacy issues, and computational inefficiency, by decoupling linguistic competence from factual retrieval.

Method: Empirically evaluate models (135M to 32B parameters) on linguistic competence, external factual knowledge, and internal factual knowledge. Analyze scaling of these characteristics.

Result: Linguistic competence and factual knowledge both improve with scale, but internal factual memorization grows disproportionately compared to core language capability.

Conclusion: A modular approach to language modeling (using smaller models for linguistic tasks and external tools for factual retrieval) is more efficient, interpretable, and sustainable.

Abstract: Large Language Models offer impressive language capabilities but suffer from
well-known limitations, including hallucinations, biases, privacy concerns, and
high computational costs. These issues are largely driven by the combination of
linguistic competence and factual memorization within a single monolithic
model. This paper introduces and empirically supports the Fundamental Language
Model (FLM) paradigm, which advocates for smaller, linguistically competent
models that offload factual retrieval to external tools. We evaluate models
ranging from 135M to 32B parameters across three dimensions: linguistic
competence, external factual knowledge, and internal factual knowledge. Our
findings reveal that while both linguistic competence and factual knowledge
improve with scale, internal factual knowledge grows significantly faster,
suggesting that model size is more closely tied to memorization than to core
language ability. These results support a modular approach to language
modeling, where compact, linguistically proficient models serve as the
foundation for tool-augmented systems. The FLM paradigm offers a path toward
more efficient, interpretable, and sustainable NLP solutions.

Method: A two-step framework: (1) LLMs annotate shared mental model elements from dialogues, and (2) a secondary LLM assesses discrepancies by comparing generated annotations against human labels.

Result: LLMs performed well on straightforward tasks but struggled with spatial reasoning and interpreting prosodic cues.

Conclusion: While LLMs show promise in analyzing team dialogues, their limitations in complex reasoning tasks must be overcome for broader applicability.

Abstract: What if large language models could not only infer human mindsets but also
expose every blind spot in team dialogue such as discrepancies in the team
members' joint understanding? We present a novel, two-step framework that
leverages large language models (LLMs) both as human-style annotators of team
dialogues to track the team's shared mental models (SMMs) and as automated
discrepancy detectors among individuals' mental states. In the first step, an
LLM generates annotations by identifying SMM elements within task-oriented
dialogues from the Cooperative Remote Search Task (CReST) corpus. Then, a
secondary LLM compares these LLM-derived annotations and human annotations
against gold-standard labels to detect and characterize divergences. We define
an SMM coherence evaluation framework for this use case and apply it to six
CReST dialogues, ultimately producing: (1) a dataset of human and LLM
annotations; (2) a reproducible evaluation framework for SMM coherence; and (3)
an empirical assessment of LLM-based discrepancy detection. Our results reveal
that, although LLMs exhibit apparent coherence on straightforward
natural-language annotation tasks, they systematically err in scenarios
requiring spatial reasoning or disambiguation of prosodic cues.

### [216] [DCPO: Dynamic Clipping Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02333)
*Shihui Yang,Chengfeng Dou,Peidong Guo,Kai Lu,Qiang Ju,Fei Deng,Rihui Xin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dynamic Clipping Policy Optimization (DCPO), a reinforcement learning approach that improves token-level exploration and response utilization for large language models. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, significantly surpassing existing methods like GRPO and DAPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reinforcement learning methods like GRPO suffer from challenges such as zero gradients, fixed clipping bounds, and poor utilization of generated responses, leading to inefficient training of large language models.

Method: DCPO employs a dynamic clipping strategy to adjust token-specific prior probabilities and a smooth advantage standardization technique to enhance training effectiveness across cumulative steps.

Result: DCPO outperforms competitors on multiple benchmarks, achieving higher accuracy, doubling training efficiency over DAPO, reducing token clipping ratios significantly, and delivering a 28% improvement in nonzero advantage compared to GRPO.

Conclusion: DCPO demonstrates significant advancements in reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards, offering superior token-level exploration, improved training efficiency, and effective data utilization for large language models.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
promising framework for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models. However, existing approaches such as GRPO often suffer from zero
gradients. This problem arises primarily due to fixed clipping bounds for
token-level probability ratios and the standardization of identical rewards,
which can lead to ineffective gradient updates and underutilization of
generated responses. In this work, we propose Dynamic Clipping Policy
Optimization (DCPO), which introduces a dynamic clipping strategy that
adaptively adjusts the clipping bounds based on token-specific prior
probabilities to enhance token-level exploration, and a smooth advantage
standardization technique that standardizes rewards across cumulative training
steps to improve the response-level effective utilization of generated
responses. DCPO achieved state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks based
on four different models. In particular, DCPO achieved an Avg@1 of 46.7 under
greedy decoding and an Avg@32 of 38.8 under 32 times sampling on the AIME24
benchmark, surpassing both DAPO (36.7/31.6) and GRPO (36.7/32.1) on the
Qwen2.5-Math-7B model. On the AIME25 benchmark based on Qwen2.5-14B, DCPO
achieves a performance of (23.3/19.0), surpassing GRPO (13.3/10.5) and DAPO
(20.0/15.3). Furthermore, DCPO achieved an average 28% improvement in the
nonzero advantage over GRPO in four models, doubled the training efficiency
over DAPO, and significantly reduced the token clipping ratio by an order of
magnitude compared to both GRPO and DAPO, while achieving superior performance.
These results highlight DCPO's effectiveness in leveraging generated data more
efficiently for reinforcement learning in large language models.

*Jindong Li,Yali Fu,Li Fan,Jiahong Liu,Yao Shu,Chengwei Qin,Menglin Yang,Irwin King,Rex Ying*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper surveys implicit reasoning mechanisms in large language models (LLMs), proposing a taxonomy to classify internal computation strategies into three paradigms: latent optimization, signal-guided control, and layer-recurrent execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Implicit reasoning in LLMs offers advantages like reduced generation cost and faster inference but lacks thorough examination on a mechanism level. The paper aims to address this gap by presenting a taxonomy focusing on computational strategies.

Method: The authors classify implicit reasoning methods into three execution paradigms, review evidence supporting its presence in LLMs, and organize benchmarks and metrics used in prior studies.

Result: Three computational paradigms for implicit reasoning are identified: latent optimization, signal-guided control, and layer-recurrent execution, along with insights into their evidence and evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: Implicit reasoning in LLMs holds promise for efficient problem-solving, and the proposed taxonomy provides a structured understanding of internal computation strategies and evaluation methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization across a
wide range of tasks. Reasoning with LLMs is central to solving multi-step
problems and complex decision-making. To support efficient reasoning, recent
studies have shifted attention from explicit chain-of-thought prompting toward
implicit reasoning, where reasoning occurs silently via latent structures
without emitting intermediate textual steps. Implicit reasoning brings
advantages such as lower generation cost, faster inference, and better
alignment with internal computation. Although prior surveys have discussed
latent representations in the context of reasoning, a dedicated and
mechanism-level examination of how reasoning unfolds internally within LLMs
remains absent. This survey fills that gap by introducing a taxonomy centered
on execution paradigms, shifting the focus from representational forms to
computational strategies. We organize existing methods into three execution
paradigms based on \textbf{\textit{how and where internal computation
unfolds}}: latent optimization, signal-guided control, and layer-recurrent
execution. We also review structural, behavioral and representation-based
evidence that supports the presence of implicit reasoning in LLMs. We further
provide a structured overview of the evaluation metrics and benchmarks used in
existing works to assess the effectiveness and reliability of implicit
reasoning.We maintain a continuously updated project at:

*Gaurav Negi,Atul Kr. Ojha,Omnia Zayed,Paul Buitelaar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a scalable method using LLMs for constructing a time-aware opinion knowledge base, aimed at enhancing text analysis applications such as forecasting and timeline summarization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methodologies for temporal opinion analysis lack fine-grained, time-aligned annotations, limiting their potential for applications like forecasting and trend analysis.

Method: The researchers integrate opinion mining frameworks into an LLM-driven annotation pipeline, employing structured data models without requiring manual prompt engineering. Their process involves quantitative evaluation and measurement of inter-annotator agreement.

Result: Using two distinct LLMs, the pipeline generates a structured, time-aligned opinion knowledge base evaluated against human-annotated samples. The models achieve label-wise agreement comparable to human protocols.

Conclusion: This knowledge base supports downstream applications such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation, temporal question answering, and summarization, demonstrating utility in improving scalability and accuracy of opinion-driven tasks.

Abstract: We propose a scalable method for constructing a temporal opinion knowledge
base with large language models (LLMs) as automated annotators. Despite the
demonstrated utility of time-series opinion analysis of text for downstream
applications such as forecasting and trend analysis, existing methodologies
underexploit this potential due to the absence of temporally grounded
fine-grained annotations. Our approach addresses this gap by integrating
well-established opinion mining formulations into a declarative LLM annotation
pipeline, enabling structured opinion extraction without manual prompt
engineering. We define three data models grounded in sentiment and opinion
mining literature, serving as schemas for structured representation. We perform
rigorous quantitative evaluation of our pipeline using human-annotated test
samples. We carry out the final annotations using two separate LLMs, and
inter-annotator agreement is computed label-wise across the fine-grained
opinion dimensions, analogous to human annotation protocols. The resulting
knowledge base encapsulates time-aligned, structured opinions and is compatible
with applications in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), temporal question
answering, and timeline summarisation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study integrates Arabic text preprocessing with transformer models for disease classification, achieving an 80.56% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve disease classification in Arabic social telehealth data using advanced techniques like LLMs and transformers.

Method: The study employs Arabic text preprocessing methods (summarization, refinement, and NER), fine-tuned transformer models, and a majority voting ensemble.

Result: The approach achieved a disease classification accuracy of 80.56%.

Conclusion: This is the first work to combine LLM-based preprocessing, transformer models, and ensemble learning for Arabic social telehealth data, showing promise in medical text understanding.

Abstract: Social telehealth has made remarkable progress in healthcare by allowing
patients to post symptoms and participate in medical consultations remotely.
Users frequently post symptoms on social media and online health platforms,
creating a huge repository of medical data that can be leveraged for disease
classification. Large language models (LLMs) such as LLAMA3 and GPT-3.5, along
with transformer-based models like BERT, have demonstrated strong capabilities
in processing complex medical text. In this study, we evaluate three Arabic
medical text preprocessing methods such as summarization, refinement, and Named
Entity Recognition (NER) before applying fine-tuned Arabic transformer models
(CAMeLBERT, AraBERT, and AsafayaBERT). To enhance robustness, we adopt a
majority voting ensemble that combines predictions from original and
preprocessed text representations. This approach achieved the best
classification accuracy of 80.56%, thus showing its effectiveness in leveraging
various text representations and model predictions to improve the understanding
of medical texts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that
integrates LLM-based preprocessing with fine-tuned Arabic transformer models
and ensemble learning for disease classification in Arabic social telehealth
data.

*Lingzhi Shen,Xiaohao Cai,Yunfei Long,Imran Razzak,Guanming Chen,Shoaib Jameel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces EmoPerso, a self-supervised framework for personality detection leveraging emotion-aware modeling to overcome limitations of existing methods reliant on large datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current systems for personality detection require large annotated datasets and typically fail to account for the interdependence between emotion and personality, limiting overall performance.

Method: EmoPerso employs synthetic data augmentation, multi-task learning with pseudo-labeled emotion features, and a cross-attention module. It incrementally improves reasoning using a self-taught strategy.

Result: Extensive tests on benchmark datasets show EmoPerso outperforms cutting-edge models, offering improved accuracy in personality detection.

Conclusion: EmoPerso is an effective method for emotion-aware personality detection, presenting a robust self-supervised approach to address existing bottlenecks in the field.

Abstract: Personality detection from text is commonly performed by analysing users'
social media posts. However, existing methods heavily rely on large-scale
annotated datasets, making it challenging to obtain high-quality personality
labels. Moreover, most studies treat emotion and personality as independent
variables, overlooking their interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel
self-supervised framework, EmoPerso, which improves personality detection
through emotion-aware modelling. EmoPerso first leverages generative mechanisms
for synthetic data augmentation and rich representation learning. It then
extracts pseudo-labeled emotion features and jointly optimizes them with
personality prediction via multi-task learning. A cross-attention module is
employed to capture fine-grained interactions between personality traits and
the inferred emotional representations. To further refine relational reasoning,
EmoPerso adopts a self-taught strategy to enhance the model's reasoning
capabilities iteratively. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets
demonstrate that EmoPerso surpasses state-of-the-art models. The source code is

*Seyedali Mohammadi,Bhaskara Hanuma Vedula,Hemank Lamba,Edward Raff,Ponnurangam Kumaraguru,Francis Ferraro,Manas Gaur*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies how large language models (LLMs) incorporate or rely on external definitions versus their parametric knowledge for task solving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether LLMs depend on external label definitions or prioritize their internalized knowledge for completing tasks.

Method: Controlled experiments were conducted across various explanation benchmark datasets, utilizing different label definition conditions such as expert-curated, LLM-generated, perturbed, and swapped definitions.

Result: Explicit label definitions can sometimes improve accuracy and explainability, but LLMs inconsistently integrate them, often defaulting to their internalized representations—especially in general tasks. Domain-specific tasks benefit more from explicit definitions.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the necessity of understanding how LLMs balance external knowledge with their internalized capabilities, emphasizing the inconsistency in how definitions influence task performance.

Abstract: Do LLMs genuinely incorporate external definitions, or do they primarily rely
on their parametric knowledge? To address these questions, we conduct
controlled experiments across multiple explanation benchmark datasets (general
and domain-specific) and label definition conditions, including expert-curated,
LLM-generated, perturbed, and swapped definitions. Our results reveal that
while explicit label definitions can enhance accuracy and explainability, their
integration into an LLM's task-solving processes is neither guaranteed nor
consistent, suggesting reliance on internalized representations in many cases.
Models often default to their internal representations, particularly in general
tasks, whereas domain-specific tasks benefit more from explicit definitions.
These findings underscore the need for a deeper understanding of how LLMs
process external knowledge alongside their pre-existing capabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an automated framework to audit foundation models against developer behavioral guidelines, revealing systemic inconsistencies in adherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of systematic auditing of foundation models against their developers' published behavioral guidelines.

Method: Developed a framework to parse behavioral statements, generate targeted prompts, and use developer models to judge adherence to their own specifications.

Result: Analyzed 16 models from six developers across 100+ behavioral statements, identifying compliance gaps of up to 20%.

Conclusion: Foundation models often fail to consistently adhere to their developers' published behavioral guidelines, emphasizing the importance of systematic auditing.

Abstract: Companies that develop foundation models publish behavioral guidelines they
pledge their models will follow, but it remains unclear if models actually do
so. While providers such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google have published
detailed specifications describing both desired safety constraints and
qualitative traits for their models, there has been no systematic audit of
adherence to these guidelines. We introduce an automated framework that audits
models against their providers specifications by parsing behavioral statements,
generating targeted prompts, and using models to judge adherence. Our central
focus is on three way consistency between a provider specification, its model
outputs, and its own models as judges; an extension of prior two way generator
validator consistency. This establishes a necessary baseline: at minimum, a
foundation model should consistently satisfy the developer behavioral
specifications when judged by the developer evaluator models. We apply our
framework to 16 models from six developers across more than 100 behavioral
statements, finding systematic inconsistencies including compliance gaps of up
to 20 percent across providers.

TL;DR: The paper proposes GRAM-R$^2$, a generative reward model that uses self-training on unlabeled data to enhance reward reasoning, outperforming current baselines in various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges in reward modeling that rely heavily on large-scale labeled preference data and to introduce explicit reasoning into the reward models.

Method: Developed a self-training approach leveraging unlabeled data for reward reasoning and introduced GRAM-R$^2$ to produce both preference labels and reward rationales.

Result: GRAM-R$^2$ showed strong performance in response ranking, task adaptation, and reinforcement learning from human feedback, surpassing existing models.

Conclusion: GRAM-R$^2$ can function as a versatile foundation model for reward reasoning, extending its application to various tasks with minimal fine-tuning.

Abstract: Significant progress in reward modeling over recent years has been driven by
a paradigm shift from task-specific designs towards generalist reward models.
Despite this trend, developing effective reward models remains a fundamental
challenge: the heavy reliance on large-scale labeled preference data.
Pre-training on abundant unlabeled data offers a promising direction, but
existing approaches fall short of instilling explicit reasoning into reward
models. To bridge this gap, we propose a self-training approach that leverages
unlabeled data to elicit reward reasoning in reward models. Based on this
approach, we develop GRAM-R$^2$, a generative reward model trained to produce
not only preference labels but also accompanying reward rationales. GRAM-R$^2$
can serve as a foundation model for reward reasoning and can be applied to a
wide range of tasks with minimal or no additional fine-tuning. It can support
downstream applications such as response ranking and task-specific reward
tuning. Experiments on response ranking, task adaptation, and reinforcement
learning from human feedback demonstrate that GRAM-R$^2$ consistently delivers
strong performance, outperforming several strong discriminative and generative
baselines.

*Junxi Wu,Jinpeng Wang,Zheng Liu,Bin Chen,Dongjian Hu,Hao Wu,Shu-Tao Xiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Mixture of Stylistic Experts (MoSEs) framework to improve AI-generated text detection by incorporating stylistics-aware modeling, achieving performance improvements, especially in low-resource scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Public concerns regarding the misuse of large language models necessitate reliable systems for detecting AI-generated text. Existing detection methods lack stylistic modeling and rely on static thresholds, leading to limited efficacy.

Method: The MoSEs framework comprises three components: Stylistics Reference Repository (SRR), Stylistics-Aware Router (SAR), and Conditional Threshold Estimator (CTE). SRR activates relevant reference data, and CTE dynamically determines the optimal detection threshold by modeling linguistic and semantic properties.

Result: MoSEs outperformed baseline AI text detection methods with an 11.34% average improvement in detection performance and a 39.15% improvement in low-resource cases.

Conclusion: The proposed MoSEs framework represents a significant advancement in AI-generated text detection, especially in low-resource contexts, emphasizing the importance of stylistics-aware modeling.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models has intensified public
concerns about the potential misuse. Therefore, it is important to build
trustworthy AI-generated text detection systems. Existing methods neglect
stylistic modeling and mostly rely on static thresholds, which greatly limits
the detection performance. In this paper, we propose the Mixture of Stylistic
Experts (MoSEs) framework that enables stylistics-aware uncertainty
quantification through conditional threshold estimation. MoSEs contain three
core components, namely, the Stylistics Reference Repository (SRR), the
Stylistics-Aware Router (SAR), and the Conditional Threshold Estimator (CTE).
For input text, SRR can activate the appropriate reference data in SRR and
provide them to CTE. Subsequently, CTE jointly models the linguistic
statistical properties and semantic features to dynamically determine the
optimal threshold. With a discrimination score, MoSEs yields prediction labels
with the corresponding confidence level. Our framework achieves an average
improvement 11.34% in detection performance compared to baselines. More
inspiringly, MoSEs shows a more evident improvement 39.15% in the low-resource
case. Our code is available at https://github.com/creator-xi/MoSEs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmark dataset for evaluating semantic understanding in low-resource Indic languages using various sentence transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic evaluation in Indic languages is challenging due to limited resources and benchmarks. The paper addresses this gap by creating a benchmarking dataset.

Method: The authors developed the L3Cube-IndicHeadline-ID dataset with 20,000 news articles per language and tested sentence transformers using cosine similarity to evaluate their performance.

Result: Multilingual sentence transformers showed consistent performance while language-specific models had varying outcomes. The dataset's versatility extends to multiple NLP tasks.

Conclusion: The dataset is a valuable resource for improving semantic understanding in low-resource Indic languages and can support a range of NLP tasks, benefiting RAG pipelines and other applications.

Abstract: Semantic evaluation in low-resource languages remains a major challenge in
NLP. While sentence transformers have shown strong performance in high-resource
settings, their effectiveness in Indic languages is underexplored due to a lack
of high-quality benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we introduce
L3Cube-IndicHeadline-ID, a curated headline identification dataset spanning ten
low-resource Indic languages: Marathi, Hindi, Tamil, Gujarati, Odia, Kannada,
Malayalam, Punjabi, Telugu, Bengali and English. Each language includes 20,000
news articles paired with four headline variants: the original, a semantically
similar version, a lexically similar version, and an unrelated one, designed to
test fine-grained semantic understanding. The task requires selecting the
correct headline from the options using article-headline similarity. We
benchmark several sentence transformers, including multilingual and
language-specific models, using cosine similarity. Results show that
multilingual models consistently perform well, while language-specific models
vary in effectiveness. Given the rising use of similarity models in
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, this dataset also serves as a
valuable resource for evaluating and improving semantic understanding in such
applications. Additionally, the dataset can be repurposed for multiple-choice
question answering, headline classification, or other task-specific evaluations
of LLMs, making it a versatile benchmark for Indic NLP. The dataset is shared

*Jean-Marie Le Ray*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study revisits Federico Pucci’s 1929 mechanical translation system, leveraging AI to validate and extend its functionality nearly a century later.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to confirm the historical significance of Federico Pucci's mechanical translation system and explore its potential application using modern AI.

Method: AI was employed to replicate Pucci’s method by re-translating excerpts from Dante and Voltaire and expanding translations into other languages.

Result: AI-generated translations closely matched Pucci’s original results from 1931, demonstrating consistency across additional languages and modern texts.

Conclusion: Pucci’s methods are validated by AI, reestablishing his contribution to machine translation history and opening doors for experimentation with his system in modern contexts.

Abstract: A pioneering rule-based mechanical translation system (precursor of modern
RBMTs) was first presented in December 1929 by its inventor, Federico Pucci,
who later published the full method in a book titled "Il traduttore meccanico
ed il metodo per corrispondersi fra Europei conoscendo ciascuno solo la propria
lingua: Parte I", in Salerno (Italy), in 1931. This study illustrates how AI
breathes new life into the system of international keys and ideograms devised
by Pucci to translate from/into any Romance language (at least as a first
step). The methodology involves having the AIs retranslate, following Pucci's
method, the two text excerpts originally translated in 1931 and clearly
documented in his publication: a passage from Dante's La Vita Nuova, translated
from Italian into French, and a passage from Voltaire's Zadig, translated from
French into Italian. The result is notable: the two texts, translated 94 years
apart using the same method--by Pucci in 1931 and by AIs in 2025--show a low
average difference, with only minor variations observed. With Pucci's system
thus validated, it became feasible to have the AIs reproduce the excerpts in
English, Spanish, and German according to his method. The results were
consistent, and Pucci--via Artificial Intelligence--was tasked with translating
more modern and technical texts, thereby reviving, nearly a century later, an
invention that had remained almost entirely unknown and never applied beyond
its creator, now brought to wider attention and opened to possible
experimentation. Such a demonstration would not only affirm Pucci's historical
status but also place him among the precursors and intellectual contributors to
machine translation, whose work merits examination alongside figures such as
Troyanskij, Booth, and Weaver, with possible consequences for how the history
of the field is understood.

TL;DR: This study evaluates the performance of different models for Named Entity Recognition (NER) in Hindi-English (Hinglish) code-mixed text. Code-mixed models like HingRoBERTa outperform others, though zero-shot large language models such as Google Gemini show strong generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of NER in Hinglish due to its informal structure, transliteration, and frequent language switching, and to evaluate the relative performance of specialized code-mixed models versus generalized multilingual and generative models.

Method: Experimental comparison of code-mixed fine-tuned models (HingBERT, HingMBERT, HingRoBERTa), non-code-mixed multilingual models (BERT Base Cased, IndicBERT, RoBERTa, MuRIL), and zero-shot Google Gemini on a benchmark Hinglish NER dataset using Precision, Recall, and F1-score metrics.

Result: Code-mixed models, especially HingRoBERTa and HingBERT, achieve the best performance. Non-code-mixed models show reasonable but limited adaptability. Google Gemini demonstrates competitive zero-shot performance, highlighting the generalization of modern LLMs.

Conclusion: Specialized code-mixed models outperform generic models for Hinglish NER tasks due to domain-specific pretraining, while general generative models like Google Gemini provide strong baseline capabilities in zero-shot scenarios.

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) in code-mixed text, particularly Hindi-English
(Hinglish), presents unique challenges due to informal structure,
transliteration, and frequent language switching. This study conducts a
comparative evaluation of code-mixed fine-tuned models and non-code-mixed
multilingual models, along with zero-shot generative large language models
(LLMs). Specifically, we evaluate HingBERT, HingMBERT, and HingRoBERTa (trained
on code-mixed data), and BERT Base Cased, IndicBERT, RoBERTa and MuRIL (trained
on non-code-mixed multilingual data). We also assess the performance of Google
Gemini in a zero-shot setting using a modified version of the dataset with NER
tags removed. All models are tested on a benchmark Hinglish NER dataset using
Precision, Recall, and F1-score. Results show that code-mixed models,
particularly HingRoBERTa and HingBERT-based fine-tuned models, outperform
others - including closed-source LLMs like Google Gemini - due to
domain-specific pretraining. Non-code-mixed models perform reasonably but show
limited adaptability. Notably, Google Gemini exhibits competitive zero-shot
performance, underlining the generalization strength of modern LLMs. This study
provides key insights into the effectiveness of specialized versus generalized
models for code-mixed NER tasks.

*Jiaming Li,Longze Chen,Ze Gong,Yukun Chen,Lu Wang,Wanwei He,Run Luo,Min Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PACS, a supervised learning framework reformulating the Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) paradigm for improved reasoning tasks, specifically targeting sparse reward signals and policy gradient instabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLVR methods exhibit issues like sparse reward signals and unstable policy updates, limiting their effectiveness in guiding large language models for challenging reasoning tasks.

Method: PACS transforms RLVR into a supervised learning task using a score function optimized via cross-entropy loss, implicitly coupling actor-critic roles and eliminating the need for classical RL-based policy updates.

Result: PACS significantly outperformed baselines like PPO and GRPO in mathematical reasoning tasks, e.g., achieving 59.78% pass@256 in AIME 2025, with improvements of 13.32 and 14.36 points over the baselines.

Conclusion: PACS provides a stable and efficient RLVR alternative, advancing reasoning capabilities in LLMs while simplifying post-training dynamics with verifiable rewards.

Abstract: Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) have
empowered large language models (LLMs) to tackle challenging reasoning tasks
such as mathematics and programming. RLVR leverages verifiable outcome rewards
to guide policy optimization, enabling LLMs to progressively improve output
quality in a grounded and reliable manner. Despite its promise, the RLVR
paradigm poses significant challenges, as existing methods often suffer from
sparse reward signals and unstable policy gradient updates, particularly in
RL-based approaches. To address the challenges, we propose $\textbf{PACS}$, a
novel RLVR framework that achieves im$\textbf{P}$licit $\textbf{A}$ctor
$\textbf{C}$ritic coupling via a $\textbf{S}$upervised learning framework. By
treating the outcome reward as a predictable label, we reformulate the RLVR
problem into a supervised learning task over a score function parameterized by
the policy model and optimized using cross-entropy loss. A detailed gradient
analysis shows that this supervised formulation inherently recovers the
classical policy gradient update while implicitly coupling actor and critic
roles, yielding more stable and efficient training. Benchmarking on challenging
mathematical reasoning tasks, PACS outperforms strong RLVR baselines, such as
PPO and GRPO, achieving superior reasoning performance. For instance, PACS
achieves 59.78\% at pass@256 on AIME 2025, representing improvements of 13.32
and 14.36 points over PPO and GRPO. This simple yet powerful framework offers a
promising avenue for LLMs post-training with verifiable rewards. Our code and
data are available as open source at https://github.com/ritzz-ai/PACS.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Moonshine, small monolingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) models that outperform multilingual counterparts and existing models of comparable or larger sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of enabling accurate ASR for underrepresented languages with models that are both small and efficient, overcoming current performance limitations.

Method: Developed monolingual ASR models with 27M parameters, leveraging a mix of high-quality human-labeled, pseudo-labeled, and synthetic data for training.

Result: Moonshine models achieved error rates 48% lower than Whisper Tiny, outperformed the 9x larger Whisper Small, and often matched or surpassed the 28x larger Whisper Medium.

Conclusion: Moonshine models set a new state of the art for their size class, enabling accessible and accurate ASR for languages with limited representation, with open-source availability for specific languages.

Abstract: We present the Flavors of Moonshine, a suite of tiny automatic speech
recognition (ASR) models specialized for a range of underrepresented languages.
Prevailing wisdom suggests that multilingual ASR models outperform monolingual
counterparts by exploiting cross-lingual phonetic similarities. We challenge
this assumption, showing that for sufficiently small models (27M parameters),
training monolingual systems on a carefully balanced mix of high-quality
human-labeled, pseudo-labeled, and synthetic data yields substantially superior
performance. On average, our models achieve error rates 48% lower than the
comparably sized Whisper Tiny model, outperform the 9x larger Whisper Small
model, and in most cases match or outperform the 28x larger Whisper Medium
model. These results advance the state of the art for models of this size,
enabling accurate on-device ASR for languages that previously had limited
support. We release Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Ukrainian, and
Vietnamese Moonshine models under a permissive open-source license.

### [230] [Jointly Reinforcing Diversity and Quality in Language Model Generations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02534)
*Tianjian Li,Yiming Zhang,Ping Yu,Swarnadeep Saha,Daniel Khashabi,Jason Weston,Jack Lanchantin,Tianlu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DARLING, a framework combining response quality and semantic diversity in language model outputs for creative and exploratory tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post-training of language models often decreases diversity of responses, which limits their capability in creative and exploratory tasks.

Method: DARLING uses a learned partition function to measure semantic diversity and combines this with quality rewards during online reinforcement learning.

Result: DARLING improves six benchmarks in both creative and verifiable tasks, showing better quality and diversity compared to quality-only reinforcement learning baselines.

Conclusion: Optimizing for diversity alongside quality catalyzes exploration and boosts output quality in language models.

Abstract: Post-training of Large Language Models (LMs) often prioritizes accuracy and
helpfulness at the expense of diversity. This creates a tension: while
post-training improves response quality, it also sharpens output distributions
and reduces the range of ideas, limiting the usefulness of LMs in creative and
exploratory tasks such as brainstorming, storytelling, or problem solving. We
address this challenge with Diversity-Aware Reinforcement Learning (DARLING), a
framework that jointly optimizes for response quality and semantic diversity.
At its core, DARLING introduces a learned partition function to measure
diversity beyond surface-level lexical variations. This diversity signal is
then combined with a quality reward during online reinforcement learning,
encouraging models to generate outputs that are both high-quality and distinct.
Experiments across multiple model families and sizes show that DARLING
generalizes to two regimes: non-verifiable tasks (instruction following and
creative writing) and verifiable tasks (competition math). On five benchmarks
in the first setting, DARLING consistently outperforms quality-only RL
baselines, producing outputs that are simultaneously of higher quality and
novelty. In the second setting, DARLING achieves higher pass@1 (solution
quality) and pass@k (solution variety). Most strikingly, explicitly optimizing
for diversity catalyzes exploration in online RL, which manifests itself as
higher-quality responses.

### [231] [PalmX 2025: The First Shared Task on Benchmarking LLMs on Arabic and Islamic Culture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02550)
*Fakhraddin Alwajih,Abdellah El Mekki,Hamdy Mubarak,Majd Hawasly,Abubakr Mohamed,Muhammad Abdul-Mageed*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PalmX 2025 introduced a shared benchmarking task to assess Large Language Models' understanding of Arabic and Islamic cultures, using Modern Standard Arabic MCQs. Top-performing models demonstrated improved accuracies via fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the lack of cultural competence in Large Language Models, particularly concerning Arabic and Islamic knowledge, due to the bias in their training data sourced largely from high-resourced languages and cultures.

Method: PalmX 2025 utilized two subtasks with multiple-choice questions focused on Arabic and Islamic cultural topics. Models were fine-tuned specifically for these domains, and approaches such as parameter-efficient fine-tuning and data augmentation were evaluated.

Result: Fine-tuning showed significant improvement in model performance, with top accuracies of 72.15% on Arabic culture and 84.22% on Islamic knowledge. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning stood out as the most effective method.

Conclusion: The study highlights that task-specific fine-tuning can considerably enhance LLMs' cultural competence, but the efficacy of methods like data augmentation varies by domain.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) inherently reflect the vast data distributions
they encounter during their pre-training phase. As this data is predominantly
sourced from the web, there is a high chance it will be skewed towards
high-resourced languages and cultures, such as those of the West. Consequently,
LLMs often exhibit a diminished understanding of certain communities, a gap
that is particularly evident in their knowledge of Arabic and Islamic cultures.
This issue becomes even more pronounced with increasingly under-represented
topics. To address this critical challenge, we introduce PalmX 2025, the first
shared task designed to benchmark the cultural competence of LLMs in these
specific domains. The task is composed of two subtasks featuring
multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA): General
Arabic Culture and General Islamic Culture. These subtasks cover a wide range
of topics, including traditions, food, history, religious practices, and
language expressions from across 22 Arab countries. The initiative drew
considerable interest, with 26 teams registering for Subtask 1 and 19 for
Subtask 2, culminating in nine and six valid submissions, respectively. Our
findings reveal that task-specific fine-tuning substantially boosts performance
over baseline models. The top-performing systems achieved an accuracy of 72.15%
on cultural questions and 84.22% on Islamic knowledge. Parameter-efficient
fine-tuning emerged as the predominant and most effective approach among
participants, while the utility of data augmentation was found to be
domain-dependent.

### [233] [AMMKD: Adaptive Multimodal Multi-teacher Distillation for Lightweight Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00039)
*Yuqi Li,Chuanguang Yang,Junhao Dong,Zhengtao Yao,Haoyan Xu,Zeyu Dong,Hansheng Zeng,Zhulin An,Yingli Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces AMMKD, a new method that uses multi-modal feature fusion, multi-teacher distillation, and adaptive optimization to create lightweight models for image-text retrieval tasks on mobile devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying large-scale visual language pretraining models on mobile devices is challenging due to their large size and computational complexity.

Method: Combining a feature fusion network, multi-teacher knowledge distillation with pre-trained CLIP models, KL scatter for distribution alignment, and adaptive dynamic weighting for optimization.

Result: AMMKD delivers superior performance on benchmark datasets while significantly lowering model complexity.

Conclusion: AMMKD proves effective and flexible for lightweight image-text retrieval tasks suitable for mobile devices.

Abstract: The success of large-scale visual language pretraining (VLP) models has
driven widespread adoption of image-text retrieval tasks. However, their
deployment on mobile devices remains limited due to large model sizes and
computational complexity. We propose Adaptive Multi-Modal Multi-Teacher
Knowledge Distillation (AMMKD), a novel framework that integrates multi-modal
feature fusion, multi-teacher distillation, and adaptive optimization to
deliver lightweight yet effective retrieval models. Specifically, our method
begins with a feature fusion network that extracts and merges discriminative
features from both the image and text modalities. To reduce model parameters
and further improve performance, we design a multi-teacher knowledge
distillation framework to pre-train two CLIP teacher models. We decouple
modalities by pre-computing and storing text features as class vectors via the
teacher text encoder to enhance efficiency. To better align teacher and student
outputs, we apply KL scatter for probability distribution matching. Finally, we
design an adaptive dynamic weighting scheme that treats multi-teacher
distillation as a multi-objective optimization problem. By leveraging gradient
space diversity, we dynamically adjust the influence of each teacher, reducing
conflicts and guiding the student toward more optimal learning directions.
Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that AMMKD
achieves superior performance while significantly reducing model complexity,
validating its effectiveness and flexibility.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a sustainability evaluation system to balance deep learning performance and energy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address high carbon emissions from deep learning training and balance performance with energy efficiency.

Method: Developed two metrics: the sustainable harmonic mean (FMS) and the area under the sustainability curve (ASC) for evaluating energy efficiency and performance.

Result: Validated the framework with benchmarks across various multimodal tasks, showing its capability in quantitative evaluation of algorithms.

Conclusion: The framework promotes practical applications of green AI research and supports industry in setting energy efficiency standards for algorithms.

Abstract: This work focuses on the high carbon emissions generated by deep learning
model training, specifically addressing the core challenge of balancing
algorithm performance and energy consumption. It proposes an innovative
two-dimensional sustainability evaluation system. Different from the
traditional single performance-oriented evaluation paradigm, this study
pioneered two quantitative indicators that integrate energy efficiency ratio
and accuracy: the sustainable harmonic mean (FMS) integrates accumulated energy
consumption and performance parameters through the harmonic mean to reveal the
algorithm performance under unit energy consumption; the area under the
sustainability curve (ASC) constructs a performance-power consumption curve to
characterize the energy efficiency characteristics of the algorithm throughout
the cycle. To verify the universality of the indicator system, the study
constructed benchmarks in various multimodal tasks, including image
classification, segmentation, pose estimation, and batch and online learning.
Experiments demonstrate that the system can provide a quantitative basis for
evaluating cross-task algorithms and promote the transition of green AI
research from theory to practice. Our sustainability evaluation framework code
can be found here, providing methodological support for the industry to
establish algorithm energy efficiency standards.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods fail to capture the subtle and fleeting nature of micro-expressions effectively, necessitating better input modalities and recognition networks.

Method: Proposing MESTI, a spatio-temporal image as a novel input modality, and MEGANet, which uses Gradient Attention blocks to enhance motion feature extraction. Evaluations are done with various CNN architectures and datasets.

Result: Combining MESTI and MEGANet achieves the highest accuracy on benchmarks and consistent performance improvements in MER tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed MESTI and MEGANet set a new benchmark in micro-expression recognition, proving to be more effective than existing methods and showcasing potential for applications.

Abstract: Micro-expression recognition (MER) is a challenging task due to the subtle
and fleeting nature of micro-expressions. Traditional input modalities, such as
Apex Frame, Optical Flow, and Dynamic Image, often fail to adequately capture
these brief facial movements, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this
study, we introduce the Micro-expression Spatio-Temporal Image (MESTI), a novel
dynamic input modality that transforms a video sequence into a single image
while preserving the essential characteristics of micro-movements.
Additionally, we present the Micro-expression Gradient Attention Network
(MEGANet), which incorporates a novel Gradient Attention block to enhance the
extraction of fine-grained motion features from micro-expressions. By combining
MESTI and MEGANet, we aim to establish a more effective approach to MER.
Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of MESTI,
comparing it with existing input modalities across three CNN architectures
(VGG19, ResNet50, and EfficientNetB0). Moreover, we demonstrate that replacing
the input of previously published MER networks with MESTI leads to consistent
performance improvements. The performance of MEGANet, both with MESTI and
Dynamic Image, is also evaluated, showing that our proposed network achieves
state-of-the-art results on the CASMEII and SAMM datasets. The combination of
MEGANet and MESTI achieves the highest accuracy reported to date, setting a new
benchmark for micro-expression recognition. These findings underscore the
potential of MESTI as a superior input modality and MEGANet as an advanced
recognition network, paving the way for more effective MER systems in a variety
of applications.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Scaffold Diffusion, a method for generating realistic sparse 3D voxel structures using discrete diffusion language modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address challenges in 3D voxel generation, such as high memory requirements and the class imbalance caused by sparsity.

Method: They propose treating voxels as tokens and employing a discrete diffusion language model to create sparse multi-category 3D voxel structures.

Result: The method demonstrates the ability to produce realistic and coherent Minecraft house structures on the 3D-Craft dataset, even with data that is over 98% sparse.

Conclusion: Scaffold Diffusion shows promise as a framework for generating sparse 3D voxel structures, extending discrete diffusion language models to non-sequential, spatial domains.

Abstract: Generating realistic sparse multi-category 3D voxel structures is difficult
due to the cubic memory scaling of voxel structures and moreover the
significant class imbalance caused by sparsity. We introduce Scaffold
Diffusion, a generative model designed for sparse multi-category 3D voxel
structures. By treating voxels as tokens, Scaffold Diffusion uses a discrete
diffusion language model to generate 3D voxel structures. We show that discrete
diffusion language models can be extended beyond inherently sequential domains
such as text to generate spatially coherent 3D structures. We evaluate on
Minecraft house structures from the 3D-Craft dataset and demonstrate that,
unlike prior baselines and an auto-regressive formulation, Scaffold Diffusion
produces realistic and coherent structures even when trained on data with over
98% sparsity. We provide an interactive viewer where readers can visualize
generated samples and the generation process. Our results highlight discrete
diffusion as a promising framework for 3D sparse voxel generative modeling.

### [238] [Dual-Stage Global and Local Feature Framework for Image Dehazing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00108)
*Anas M. Ali,Anis Koubaa,Bilel Benjdira*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Streamlined Global and Local Features Combinator (SGLC), a framework aimed at overcoming performance degradation in high-resolution image dehazing by effectively merging global contextual data with fine-grained details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address performance issues in dehazing high-resolution images, where current methods struggle to balance global and local feature integration, causing degraded image quality.

Method: The proposed SGLC framework consists of two components: the Global Features Generator (GFG) for initial dehazing using global scene information, and the Local Features Enhancer (LFE) for refining pixel-level details to enhance image quality.

Result: Integrating SGLC with the Uformer architecture led to notable improvements in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) on high-resolution datasets, showcasing its effectiveness.

Conclusion: SGLC significantly enhances visual fidelity in high-resolution image dehazing and is model-agnostic, offering utility across various dehazing networks to integrate global and local features.

Abstract: Addressing the challenge of removing atmospheric fog or haze from digital
images, known as image dehazing, has recently gained significant traction in
the computer vision community. Although contemporary dehazing models have
demonstrated promising performance, few have thoroughly investigated
high-resolution imagery. In such scenarios, practitioners often resort to
downsampling the input image or processing it in smaller patches, which leads
to a notable performance degradation. This drop is primarily linked to the
difficulty of effectively combining global contextual information with
localized, fine-grained details as the spatial resolution grows. In this
chapter, we propose a novel framework, termed the Streamlined Global and Local
Features Combinator (SGLC), to bridge this gap and enable robust dehazing for
high-resolution inputs. Our approach is composed of two principal components:
the Global Features Generator (GFG) and the Local Features Enhancer (LFE). The
GFG produces an initial dehazed output by focusing on broad contextual
understanding of the scene. Subsequently, the LFE refines this preliminary
output by enhancing localized details and pixel-level features, thereby
capturing the interplay between global appearance and local structure. To
evaluate the effectiveness of SGLC, we integrated it with the Uformer
architecture, a state-of-the-art dehazing model. Experimental results on
high-resolution datasets reveal a considerable improvement in peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) when employing SGLC, indicating its potency in
addressing haze in large-scale imagery. Moreover, the SGLC design is
model-agnostic, allowing any dehazing network to be augmented with the proposed
global-and-local feature fusion mechanism. Through this strategy, practitioners
can harness both scene-level cues and granular details, significantly improving
visual fidelity in high-resolution environments.

*Ivan Slootweg,Natalia P. García-De-La-Puente,Geert Litjens,Salma Dammak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a self-supervised kidney abnormality detection model to enhance preclinical drug safety studies by reducing costs and time required for analyzing whole-slide images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current kidney abnormality detection in drug safety studies is time-intensive and expensive due to the need to examine numerous whole-slide images, most of which are normal.

Method: The researchers used features extracted from the UNI foundation model and applied self-supervised learning techniques to improve the detection of kidney abnormalities, testing the approach on data from 158 drug compounds.

Result: A self-supervised model demonstrated better-than-chance performance with an AUC of 0.62 and a high negative predictive value of 89%, outperforming a k-nearest neighbor classifier using just FM features.

Conclusion: This framework has potential to streamline drug safety assessment by identifying normal slides, thus saving time and reducing costs in preclinical drug development studies.

Abstract: Kidney abnormality detection is required for all preclinical drug
development. It involves a time-consuming and costly examination of hundreds to
thousands of whole-slide images per drug safety study, most of which are
normal, to detect any subtle changes indicating toxic effects. In this study,
we present the first large-scale self-supervised abnormality detection model
for kidney toxicologic pathology, spanning drug safety assessment studies from
158 compounds. We explore the complexity of kidney abnormality detection on
this scale using features extracted from the UNI foundation model (FM) and show
that a simple k-nearest neighbor classifier on these features performs at
chance, demonstrating that the FM-generated features alone are insufficient for
detecting abnormalities. We then demonstrate that a self-supervised method
applied to the same features can achieve better-than-chance performance, with
an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.62 and a
negative predictive value of 89%. With further development, such a model can be
used to rule out normal slides in drug safety assessment studies, reducing the
costs and time associated with drug development.

Motivation: There is limited understanding of how Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) perform in cluttered and complex environments with deformed objects.

Method: The authors create a novel dataset for waste classification in real-world complex scenarios and propose an evaluation framework to rigorously analyze VLLMs’ performance.

Result: The study shows that existing VLLMs struggle in complex and deformed object environments, revealing critical gaps in robustness.

Conclusion: Further advancements are needed in VLLMs to handle challenging real-world scenarios, and the dataset and code make this research repeatable for the community.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have paved the way for
Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) capable of performing a wide range of
visual understanding tasks. While LLMs have demonstrated impressive performance
on standard natural images, their capabilities have not been thoroughly
explored in cluttered datasets where there is complex environment having
deformed shaped objects. In this work, we introduce a novel dataset
specifically designed for waste classification in real-world scenarios,
characterized by complex environments and deformed shaped objects. Along with
this dataset, we present an in-depth evaluation approach to rigorously assess
the robustness and accuracy of VLLMs. The introduced dataset and comprehensive
analysis provide valuable insights into the performance of VLLMs under

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a text-to-image retrieval system that converts text queries into visual queries using a generative diffusion model for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Examine the limitations of vision-and-language models (like CLIP) for text-to-image retrieval due to the modality gap in their representation spaces.

Method: Two-step approach: First, convert text queries into visual queries using a generative diffusion model; second, compute image-to-image similarity using a vision model. Incorporates an aggregation network to combine multiple generated representations and fuse similarity scores.

Result: The proposed method outperforms conventional text-query-only retrieval techniques on various benchmarks.

Conclusion: Transformation of text queries into visual representations significantly boosts retrieval accuracy, demonstrating the potential of fusing textual and visual modalities for improved performance.

Abstract: This work explores text-to-image retrieval for queries that specify or
describe a semantic category. While vision-and-language models (VLMs) like CLIP
offer a straightforward open-vocabulary solution, they map text and images to
distant regions in the representation space, limiting retrieval performance. To
bridge this modality gap, we propose a two-step approach. First, we transform
the text query into a visual query using a generative diffusion model. Then, we
estimate image-to-image similarity with a vision model. Additionally, we
introduce an aggregation network that combines multiple generated images into a
single vector representation and fuses similarity scores across both query
modalities. Our approach leverages advancements in vision encoders, VLMs, and
text-to-image generation models. Extensive evaluations show that it
consistently outperforms retrieval methods relying solely on text queries.

### [243] [Safe-LLaVA: A Privacy-Preserving Vision-Language Dataset and Benchmark for Biometric Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00192)
*Younggun Kim,Sirnam Swetha,Fazil Kagdi,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a benchmark (PRISM) to evaluate privacy concerns in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and a privacy-preserving dataset (Safe-LLaVA) for training MLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the absence of publicly available datasets or benchmarks to evaluate and mitigate biometric leakage in multimodal large language models, which pose significant privacy concerns in real-world settings.

Method: The authors created PRISM, a benchmark to evaluate MLLMs' refusal of biometric-related queries and implicit biometric leakage in responses, while also constructing Safe-LLaVA, a dataset stripped of biometric information.

Result: Evaluations using PRISM exposed significant biometric leakage in existing MLLMs, and fine-tuning a model on Safe-LLaVA demonstrated a substantial reduction in these privacy violations.

Conclusion: PRISM and Safe-LLaVA collectively establish a new standard for privacy-conscious development and evaluation of MLLMs, addressing critical privacy concerns in their deployment.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in vision-language tasks. However, these models often infer and
reveal sensitive biometric attributes - such as race, gender, age, body weight,
and eye color - even when such information is not explicitly requested. This
raises critical concerns, particularly in real-world applications and
socially-sensitive domains. Despite increasing awareness, no publicly available
dataset or benchmark exists to comprehensively evaluate or mitigate biometric
leakage in MLLMs. To address this gap, we introduce PRISM (Privacy-aware
Evaluation of Responses in Sensitive Modalities), a new benchmark designed to
assess MLLMs on two fronts: (1) refuse biometric-related queries and (2)
implicit biometric leakage in general responses while maintaining semantic
faithfulness. Further, we conduct a detailed audit of the widely used LLaVA
datasets and uncover extensive biometric leakage across pretraining and
instruction data. To address this, we present Safe-LLaVA dataset, the first
privacy-preserving MLLM training dataset constructed by systematically removing
explicit and implicit biometric information from LLaVA dataset. Our evaluations
on PRISM reveal biometric leakages across MLLMs for different attributes,
highlighting the detailed privacy-violations. We also fine-tune a model on
Safe-LLaVA dataset and show that it substantially reduces the biometric
leakages. Together, Safe-LLaVA & PRISM set a new standard for privacy-aligned
development and evaluation of MLLMs. The Safe-LLaVA dataset & PRISM benchmark
are publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/kyh9191/Safe-LLaVA,

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models lack human-like reasoning in dynamic tasks due to insufficient spatio-temporal modeling and physical world comprehension.

Method: VEME introduces a cross-modal alignment framework, a cognitive memory map activated by world embedding, and an instruction-based navigation and reasoning system.

Result: VEME improves accuracy and exploration efficiency by 1%-3% compared to traditional methods, tested on benchmarks VSI-Bench and VLN-CE.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates enhanced spatio-temporal reasoning and planning capabilities, tackling challenges of unseen scenes and improving embodied intelligence.

Abstract: Achieving human-like reasoning in deep learning models for complex tasks in
unknown environments remains a critical challenge in embodied intelligence.
While advanced vision-language models (VLMs) excel in static scene
understanding, their limitations in spatio-temporal reasoning and adaptation to
dynamic, open-set tasks like task-oriented navigation and embodied question
answering (EQA) persist due to inadequate modeling of fine-grained
spatio-temporal cues and physical world comprehension. To address this, we
propose VEME, a novel cross-modal alignment method that enhances generalization
in unseen scenes by learning an ego-centric, experience-centered world model.
Our framework integrates three key components: (1) a cross-modal alignment
framework bridging objects, spatial representations, and visual semantics with
spatio-temporal cues to enhance VLM in-context learning; (2) a dynamic,
implicit cognitive map activated by world embedding to enable task-relevant
geometric-semantic memory recall; and (3) an instruction-based navigation and
reasoning framework leveraging embodied priors for long-term planning and
efficient exploration. By embedding geometry-aware spatio-temporal episodic
experiences, our method significantly improves reasoning and planning in
dynamic environments. Experimental results on VSI-Bench and VLN-CE demonstrate
1%-3% accuracy and exploration efficiency improvement compared to traditional
approaches.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multimodal AI framework combining breast ultrasound images and clinical data to better differentiate phyllodes tumors from fibroadenomas, achieving high diagnostic accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of differentiating phyllodes tumors from fibroadenomas preoperatively, which often results in unnecessary surgeries due to their radiological similarities.

Method: A dual-branch neural network integrating ultrasound images and clinical metadata was developed, with class-aware sampling and 5-fold cross-validation applied to ensure data robustness.

Result: The multimodal approach outperformed unimodal methods. ConvNeXt and ResNet18 showed the best performance, achieving AUC-ROC scores of 0.9427 and 0.9349, respectively, and notable F1-scores.

Conclusion: The study shows the promise of multimodal AI as a non-invasive tool to aid in breast tumor diagnostics, potentially reducing unnecessary surgical procedures and supporting clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Phyllodes tumors (PTs) are rare fibroepithelial breast lesions that are
difficult to classify preoperatively due to their radiological similarity to
benign fibroadenomas. This often leads to unnecessary surgical excisions. To
address this, we propose a multimodal deep learning framework that integrates
breast ultrasound (BUS) images with structured clinical data to improve
diagnostic accuracy. We developed a dual-branch neural network that extracts
and fuses features from ultrasound images and patient metadata from 81 subjects
with confirmed PTs. Class-aware sampling and subject-stratified 5-fold
cross-validation were applied to prevent class imbalance and data leakage. The
results show that our proposed multimodal method outperforms unimodal baselines
in classifying benign versus borderline/malignant PTs. Among six image
encoders, ConvNeXt and ResNet18 achieved the best performance in the multimodal
setting, with AUC-ROC scores of 0.9427 and 0.9349, and F1-scores of 0.6720 and
0.7294, respectively. This study demonstrates the potential of multimodal AI to
serve as a non-invasive diagnostic tool, reducing unnecessary biopsies and
improving clinical decision-making in breast tumor management.

Motivation: To improve automated classification of gravitational lenses in preparation for LSST's discovery of ~100,000 lenses, enabling better insights into dark matter and cosmological parameters.

Method: The paper uses Vision Transformer (ViT) models and MLP-Mixer that are pretrained, fine-tuned, and compared against convolutional baselines. It explores transfer learning's impacts through various data and training strategies.

Result: Fine-tuned ten architectures were tested on datasets like HOLISMOKES VI and SuGOHI X, with insights on lens detectability, model complexity, and inference time provided.

Conclusion: GraViT demonstrates robust gravitational lens detection using advanced model architectures and training methods, offering potential advancements for automated LSST analyses.

Abstract: Gravitational lensing offers a powerful probe into the properties of dark
matter and is crucial to infer cosmological parameters. The Legacy Survey of
Space and Time (LSST) is predicted to find O(10^5) gravitational lenses over
the next decade, demanding automated classifiers. In this work, we introduce
GraViT, a PyTorch pipeline for gravitational lens detection that leverages
extensive pretraining of state-of-the-art Vision Transformer (ViT) models and
MLP-Mixer. We assess the impact of transfer learning on classification
performance by examining data quality (source and sample size), model
architecture (selection and fine-tuning), training strategies (augmentation,
normalization, and optimization), and ensemble predictions. This study
reproduces the experiments in a previous systematic comparison of neural
networks and provides insights into the detectability of strong gravitational
lenses on that common test sample. We fine-tune ten architectures using
datasets from HOLISMOKES VI and SuGOHI X, and benchmark them against
convolutional baselines, discussing complexity and inference-time analysis.

*Danil Kazimirov,Dmitry Nikolaev*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the $FHT2SP$ algorithm, a Hough Transform (HT) variant that achieves near-optimal computational complexity and constant-bounded approximation error using a superpixel-based approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the trade-off between computational complexity and accuracy in existing Hough Transform (HT) algorithms for image analysis.

Method: The authors build on the concept of superpixels from an older algorithm (Brady's), extend it to arbitrary shapes, and integrate it into the $FHT2DT$ algorithm to achieve their goals.

Result: The $FHT2SP$ algorithm achieves near-optimal complexity of $
obreak{O(wh \ln^3 w)}$ for images and maintains a constant-bounded error independent of image size, adjustable via a meta-parameter.

Conclusion: The proposed $FHT2SP$ algorithm balances computational efficiency with high accuracy, making it a significant advancement in Hough Transform algorithms for images of arbitrary sizes.

Abstract: The Hough transform (HT) is a fundamental tool across various domains, from
classical image analysis to neural networks and tomography. Two key aspects of
the algorithms for computing the HT are their computational complexity and
accuracy - the latter often defined as the error of approximation of continuous
lines by discrete ones within the image region. The fast HT (FHT) algorithms
with optimal linearithmic complexity - such as the Brady-Yong algorithm for
power-of-two-sized images - are well established. Generalizations like $FHT2DT$
extend this efficiency to arbitrary image sizes, but with reduced accuracy that
worsens with scale. Conversely, accurate HT algorithms achieve constant-bounded
error but require near-cubic computational cost. This paper introduces $FHT2SP$
algorithm - a fast and highly accurate HT algorithm. It builds on our
development of Brady's superpixel concept, extending it to arbitrary shapes
beyond the original power-of-two square constraint, and integrates it into the
$FHT2DT$ algorithm. With an appropriate choice of the superpixel's size, for an
image of shape $w \times h$, the $FHT2SP$ algorithm achieves near-optimal
computational complexity $\mathcal{O}(wh \ln^3 w)$, while keeping the
approximation error bounded by a constant independent of image size, and
controllable via a meta-parameter. We provide theoretical and experimental
analyses of the algorithm's complexity and accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a generative vision system using vision-language models for precise contour detection in manufacturing, significantly improving fidelity and edge alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial computer vision systems face limitations due to noise, material variability, and uncontrolled imaging conditions, which hinder the effectiveness of traditional approaches.

Method: The solution involves a three-stage system: data acquisition and preprocessing, contour generation using conditional GANs, and multimodal contour refinement with vision-language models guided by standardized human-in-the-loop prompts.

Result: The proposed system achieved better contour fidelity, improved edge continuity, and reduced manual tracing on FabTrack datasets. GPT-image-1 outperformed Gemini 2.0 Flash in structural accuracy and perceptual quality during refinement.

Conclusion: The study highlights the effectiveness of VLM-guided generative workflows in overcoming constraints of classical computer vision pipelines for industrial applications.

Abstract: Industrial computer vision systems often struggle with noise, material
variability, and uncontrolled imaging conditions, limiting the effectiveness of
classical edge detectors and handcrafted pipelines. In this work, we present a
language-guided generative vision system for remnant contour detection in
manufacturing, designed to achieve CAD-level precision. The system is organized
into three stages: data acquisition and preprocessing, contour generation using
a conditional GAN, and multimodal contour refinement through vision-language
modeling, where standardized prompts are crafted in a human-in-the-loop process
and applied through image-text guided synthesis. On proprietary FabTrack
datasets, the proposed system improved contour fidelity, enhancing edge
continuity and geometric alignment while reducing manual tracing. For the
refinement stage, we benchmarked several vision-language models, including
Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash, OpenAI's GPT-image-1 integrated within a VLM-guided
workflow, and open-source baselines. Under standardized conditions, GPT-image-1
consistently outperformed Gemini 2.0 Flash in both structural accuracy and
perceptual quality. These findings demonstrate the promise of VLM-guided
generative workflows for advancing industrial computer vision beyond the
limitations of classical pipelines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces LIMO, a new method for transductive few-shot learning using foundational vision-language models (VLMs), achieving significant performance improvements over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the gap in transductive few-shot learning research for vision-language models (VLMs) and develop methods tailored to this context.

Method: The paper proposes LIMO, a Language-aware Information Maximization loss that combines mutual information, KL divergence, and cross-entropy losses. It also explores parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategies.

Result: LIMO significantly outperforms recent transductive few-shot CLIP methods, as well as the best-performing inductive methods, in comprehensive evaluations.

Conclusion: LIMO demonstrates the potential of applying information-theoretic approaches and PEFT strategies in transductive few-shot VLMs, establishing new benchmarks in performance.

Abstract: Transductive few-shot learning has triggered an abundant literature focusing
on vision-only models, but is still at a nascent stage within the recent
context of foundational vision-language models (VLMs). Only a few recent
methods addressed the problem, pointing to the potential of tranduction in VLMs
and to the need for VLM-tailored methods. Building on this momentum, we
leverage information-theoretic concepts and recent progress in
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), developing a highly competitive
transductive few-shot CLIP method. Specifically, we introduce a novel
Language-aware Information MaximizatiOn (LIMO) loss integrating three
complementary terms: (i) the mutual information between the vision inputs and
the textual class descriptions; (ii) a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
penalizing deviation of the network's probabilistic outputs from the
text-driven zero-shot predictions; and (iii) a standard cross-entropy loss
based on the labeled shots. Furthermore, we challenge the commonly followed
fine-tuning practices in the context of transductive few-shot learning, and
explore PEFT strategies, completely overlooked in this context. Surprisingly,
we observe substantial boosts in performances, which points to the potential of
adapting a subset of the model's parameters in the transductive few-shot
setting. We report comprehensive evaluations, which show that LIMO outperforms
the very recent transductive few-shot CLIP methods by a large margin and yields
significant gains over the best-performing inductive methods. Our code is

*Hikmat Khan,Syed Farhan Alam Zaidi,Pir Masoom Shah,Kiruthika Balakrishnan,Rabia Khan,Muhammad Waqas,Jia Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MorphGen improves domain generalization in computational histopathology by focusing on biologically robust nuclear morphology and spatial organization within a supervised contrastive learning framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of domain generalization in histopathology, caused by variations across institutions in tissue preparation, staining, and imaging. It draws inspiration from the domain-invariant morphological cues pathologists rely on.

Method: MorphGen integrates histopathology images, augmentations, and nuclear segmentation masks into a supervised contrastive learning framework. It aligns latent representations of images and nuclear masks while incorporating stochastic weight averaging to improve robustness.

Result: MorphGen prioritizes diagnostic features over staining artifacts, demonstrates improved out-of-distribution generalization, and resilience to image corruptions and adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: The approach successfully enhances domain generalization and robustness of deep learning systems in digital pathology by focusing on biologically-informed features.

Abstract: Domain generalization in computational histopathology is hindered by
heterogeneity in whole slide images (WSIs), caused by variations in tissue
preparation, staining, and imaging conditions across institutions. Unlike
machine learning systems, pathologists rely on domain-invariant morphological
cues such as nuclear atypia (enlargement, irregular contours, hyperchromasia,
chromatin texture, spatial disorganization), structural atypia (abnormal
architecture and gland formation), and overall morphological atypia that remain
diagnostic across diverse settings. Motivated by this, we hypothesize that
explicitly modeling biologically robust nuclear morphology and spatial
organization will enable the learning of cancer representations that are
resilient to domain shifts. We propose MorphGen (Morphology-Guided
Generalization), a method that integrates histopathology images, augmentations,
and nuclear segmentation masks within a supervised contrastive learning
framework. By aligning latent representations of images and nuclear masks,
MorphGen prioritizes diagnostic features such as nuclear and morphological
atypia and spatial organization over staining artifacts and domain-specific
features. To further enhance out-of-distribution robustness, we incorporate
stochastic weight averaging (SWA), steering optimization toward flatter minima.
Attention map analyses revealed that MorphGen primarily relies on nuclear
morphology, cellular composition, and spatial cell organization within tumors
or normal regions for final classification. Finally, we demonstrate resilience
of the learned representations to image corruptions (such as staining
artifacts) and adversarial attacks, showcasing not only OOD generalization but
also addressing critical vulnerabilities in current deep learning systems for
digital pathology. Code, datasets, and trained models are available at:

*Hao Zhang,Mengsi Lyu,Chenrui He,Yulong Ao,Yonghua Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a visual token pruning strategy for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to significantly reduce computational and memory costs during inference while maintaining strong performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the computational and memory inefficiencies in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) caused by the high token count, focusing particularly on the redundancy in visual tokens.

Method: The paper introduces a mutual information-based token pruning strategy aimed at removing misaligned visual tokens to enhance cross-modal alignment and reducing redundant tokens by maximizing pairwise distances in the embedding space using a greedy algorithm.

Result: The proposed method reduces visual tokens by 88.9% while improving inference speed by 56.7%, with LMMs like LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-NEXT-7B maintaining strong performance.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that visual token pruning can effectively balance computational efficiency and model performance in LMMs, making it a viable approach for optimizing multimodal tasks.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved significant success across
various tasks. These models usually encode visual inputs into dense token
sequences, which are then concatenated with textual tokens and jointly
processed by a language model. However, the increased token count substantially
raises computational and memory costs during inference. Token pruning has
emerged as a promising approach to address this issue. Existing token pruning
methods often rely on costly calibration or suboptimal importance metrics,
leading to redundant retained tokens. In this paper, we analyze the redundancy
differences between visual and textual tokens and propose pruning exclusively
on visual tokens. Based on this, we propose a visual token pruning strategy
that explicitly preserves both cross-modal alignment and intra-modal
informational diversity. We introduce a mutual information-based token pruning
strategy that removes visual tokens semantically misaligned with textual
tokens, effectively preserving the alignment between the visual and textual
modalities. To further improve the representational quality of the retained
tokens, we additionally prune redundant visual tokens by maximizing the
expected pairwise distances in the embedding space, which is solved efficiently
with a greedy algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
maintains strong performance while reducing tokens by 88.9% on models such as
LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-NEXT-7B, resulting in a 56.7% improvement in inference
speed.

Result: Demonstrates faster inference times, higher verification accuracy, and resolution-independent performance compared to previous FHE-based approaches.

Conclusion: CryptoFace advances secure and efficient face recognition, offering robust privacy protection for biometric data and enabling practical applications.

Abstract: Face recognition is central to many authentication, security, and
personalized applications. Yet, it suffers from significant privacy risks,
particularly arising from unauthorized access to sensitive biometric data. This
paper introduces CryptoFace, the first end-to-end encrypted face recognition
system with fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). It enables secure processing of
facial data across all stages of a face-recognition process--feature
extraction, storage, and matching--without exposing raw images or features. We
introduce a mixture of shallow patch convolutional networks to support
higher-dimensional tensors via patch-based processing while reducing the
multiplicative depth and, thus, inference latency. Parallel FHE evaluation of
these networks ensures near-resolution-independent latency. On standard face
recognition benchmarks, CryptoFace significantly accelerates inference and
increases verification accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art FHE neural
networks adapted for face recognition. CryptoFace will facilitate secure face
recognition systems requiring robust and provable security. The code is

TL;DR: The paper introduces LUT-Fuse, a novel approach to infrared-visible image fusion focusing on extreme speed and applicability to real-time devices through learnable lookup tables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fusion research emphasizes performance but overlooks real-time processing suitability for practical devices, creating a gap for fast and efficient methods.

Method: The authors propose a learnable lookup table (LUT) structure combining low-order approximation encoding and high-level joint contextual scene encoding, enhanced by an LUT distillation strategy instead of traditional quantization for multi-modal image fusion.

Result: LUT-Fuse achieves significant efficiency improvements, being over 10 times faster than current lightweight state-of-the-art fusion algorithms, while maintaining high performance.

Conclusion: LUT-Fuse balances speed and performance, making advanced image fusion feasible for real-time applications, even on low-power devices, backed by extensive experiments.

Abstract: Current advanced research on infrared and visible image fusion primarily
focuses on improving fusion performance, often neglecting the applicability on
real-time fusion devices. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that
towards extremely fast fusion via distillation to learnable lookup tables
specifically designed for image fusion, termed as LUT-Fuse. Firstly, we develop
a look-up table structure that utilizing low-order approximation encoding and
high-level joint contextual scene encoding, which is well-suited for
multi-modal fusion. Moreover, given the lack of ground truth in multi-modal
image fusion, we naturally proposed the efficient LUT distillation strategy
instead of traditional quantization LUT methods. By integrating the performance
of the multi-modal fusion network (MM-Net) into the MM-LUT model, our method
achieves significant breakthroughs in efficiency and performance. It typically
requires less than one-tenth of the time compared to the current lightweight
SOTA fusion algorithms, ensuring high operational speed across various
scenarios, even in low-power mobile devices. Extensive experiments validate the
superiority, reliability, and stability of our fusion approach. The code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper tackles Single Domain Generalization (SDG) by using textual descriptions of target domains to improve model generalization in unseen environments. They propose the TO-SDG framework and introduce the STAR module to use these descriptions effectively, achieving strong experimental results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models often fail when applied to data distributions that differ from their training data. Existing solutions for SDG lack the utilization of textual metadata about target environments, which is both practical and often overlooked.

Method: The paper introduces TO-SDG and the STAR module. STAR re-centers image features toward a target domain described in text using VLMs like CLIP, employs spectral projection to retain target-relevant information, and uses vision-language distillation and feature-space Mixup for better alignment and smooth generalization.

Result: The proposed STAR module demonstrates superior performance in multiple benchmarks, showing its effectiveness in addressing SDG with minimal textual metadata.

Conclusion: This work highlights the untapped potential of using textual metadata for generalization, providing a novel, practical approach for robust model deployment in unseen target environments.

Abstract: Deep models trained on a single source domain often fail catastrophically
under distribution shifts, a critical challenge in Single Domain Generalization
(SDG). While existing methods focus on augmenting source data or learning
invariant features, they neglect a readily available resource: textual
descriptions of the target deployment environment. We propose Target-Oriented
Single Domain Generalization (TO-SDG), a novel problem setup that leverages the
textual description of the target domain, without requiring any target data, to
guide model generalization. To address TO-SDG, we introduce Spectral TARget
Alignment (STAR), a lightweight module that injects target semantics into
source features by exploiting visual-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP. STAR
uses a target-anchored subspace derived from the text embedding of the target
description to recenter image features toward the deployment domain, then
utilizes spectral projection to retain directions aligned with target cues
while discarding source-specific noise. Moreover, we use a vision-language
distillation to align backbone features with VLM's semantic geometry. STAR
further employs feature-space Mixup to ensure smooth transitions between source
and target-oriented representations. Experiments across various image
classification and object detection benchmarks demonstrate STAR's superiority.
This work establishes that minimal textual metadata, which is a practical and
often overlooked resource, significantly enhances generalization under severe
data constraints, opening new avenues for deploying robust models in target
environments with unseen data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ILRNet, an iterative low-rank network for hyperspectral image denoising, combining model-driven rank minimization with the data-driven U-Net architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve hyperspectral image denoising by leveraging their low-rank and sparse representation properties while preserving image details.

Method: The method integrates a rank minimization module (RMM) into a U-Net architecture, applies singular value thresholding in the wavelet domain, and uses an iterative refinement approach.

Result: ILRNet achieves state-of-the-art results in both synthetic and real-world hyperspectral image noise removal tasks.

Conclusion: ILRNet effectively balances denoising and detail preservation, providing a powerful solution for hyperspectral image processing.

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising is a crucial preprocessing step for
subsequent tasks. The clean HSI usually reside in a low-dimensional subspace,
which can be captured by low-rank and sparse representation, known as the
physical prior of HSI. It is generally challenging to adequately use such
physical properties for effective denoising while preserving image details.
This paper introduces a novel iterative low-rank network (ILRNet) to address
these challenges. ILRNet integrates the strengths of model-driven and
data-driven approaches by embedding a rank minimization module (RMM) within a
U-Net architecture. This module transforms feature maps into the wavelet domain
and applies singular value thresholding (SVT) to the low-frequency components
during the forward pass, leveraging the spectral low-rankness of HSIs in the
feature domain. The parameter, closely related to the hyperparameter of the
singular vector thresholding algorithm, is adaptively learned from the data,
allowing for flexible and effective capture of low-rankness across different
scenarios. Additionally, ILRNet features an iterative refinement process that
adaptively combines intermediate denoised HSIs with noisy inputs. This manner
ensures progressive enhancement and superior preservation of image details.
Experimental results demonstrate that ILRNet achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both synthetic and real-world noise removal tasks.

Result: Achieved significant improvements across diverse surgical video understanding tasks like captioning, VQA, and temporal VQA.

Conclusion: SurgLLM is effective for versatile surgical video understanding, outperforming state-of-the-art methods and offering a comprehensive solution for CAS systems.

Abstract: Surgical video understanding is crucial for facilitating Computer-Assisted
Surgery (CAS) systems. Despite significant progress in existing studies, two
major limitations persist, including inadequate visual content perception and
insufficient temporal awareness in surgical videos, and hinder the development
of versatile CAS solutions. In this work, we propose the SurgLLM framework, an
effective large multimodal model tailored for versatile surgical video
understanding tasks with enhanced spatial focus and temporal awareness.
Specifically, to empower the spatial focus of surgical videos, we first devise
Surgical Context-aware Multimodal Pretraining (Surg-Pretrain) for the video
encoder of SurgLLM, by performing instrument-centric Masked Video
Reconstruction (MV-Recon) and subsequent multimodal alignment. To incorporate
surgical temporal knowledge into SurgLLM, we further propose Temporal-aware
Multimodal Tuning (TM-Tuning) to enhance temporal reasoning with interleaved
multimodal embeddings. Moreover, to accommodate various understanding tasks of
surgical videos without conflicts, we devise a Surgical Task Dynamic Ensemble
to efficiently triage a query with optimal learnable parameters in our SurgLLM.
Extensive experiments performed on diverse surgical video understanding tasks,
including captioning, general VQA, and temporal VQA, demonstrate significant
improvements over the state-of-the-art approaches, validating the effectiveness
of our SurgLLM in versatile surgical video understanding. The source code is

TL;DR: Object detection in Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) faces challenges related to scalability, adaptability, and privacy when relying on centralized approaches. Instead, this paper examines Federated Learning (FL) for privacy-preserving and collaborative training under real-world constraints like non-IID data, limited computing resources, and environmental variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of centralized training for object detection in CAVs, notably scalability, adaptability, and privacy. FL appears as a promising alternative but faces challenges in deployment under practical conditions.

Method: The study conducts a deployment-oriented evaluation of FL-based object detection models using state-of-the-art detectors (YOLOv5, YOLOv8, YOLOv11, and Deformable DETR) tested on datasets such as KITTI, BDD100K, and nuScenes. Metrics include detection accuracy, computational cost, resource usage, and client participation under varied environmental and system conditions.

Result: The evaluation highlights trade-offs between model performance, resource demands, and environmental robustness across different object detection architectures and training configurations. It offers insights into the limitations and potential of FL for real-world CAV applications.

Conclusion: This holistic evaluation provides a foundation for deploying FL-based object detection in CAVs while balancing computational demands, adaptability to environmental conditions, and privacy concerns, ensuring robust and scalable performance.

Abstract: Object detection is crucial for Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) to
perceive their surroundings and make safe driving decisions. Centralized
training of object detection models often achieves promising accuracy, fast
convergence, and simplified training process, but it falls short in
scalability, adaptability, and privacy-preservation. Federated learning (FL),
by contrast, enables collaborative, privacy-preserving, and continuous training
across naturally distributed CAV fleets. However, deploying FL in real-world
CAVs remains challenging due to the substantial computational demands of
training and inference, coupled with highly diverse operating conditions.
Practical deployment must address three critical factors: (i) heterogeneity
from non-IID data distributions, (ii) constrained onboard computing hardware,
and (iii) environmental variability such as lighting and weather, alongside
systematic evaluation to ensure reliable performance. This work introduces the
first holistic deployment-oriented evaluation of FL-based object detection in
CAVs, integrating model performance, system-level resource profiling, and
environmental robustness. Using state-of-the-art detectors, YOLOv5, YOLOv8,
YOLOv11, and Deformable DETR, evaluated on the KITTI, BDD100K, and nuScenes
datasets, we analyze trade-offs between detection accuracy, computational cost,
and resource usage under diverse resolutions, batch sizes, weather and lighting
conditions, and dynamic client participation, paving the way for robust FL
deployment in CAVs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a publicly available multimodal dataset of PET/CT scans for head and neck cancer with annotated tumor volumes, clinical metadata, and benchmark results for deep-learning applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This work aims to address the need for a comprehensive, annotated dataset that reflects real-world clinical diversity for research in automated tumor segmentation, prognosis prediction, and HPV status classification.

Method: The dataset includes FDG-PET/CT studies from 1123 patients, with manual segmentation performed by experts following standardized protocols. The paper also demonstrates the application of deep-learning models like UNet and SegResNet for benchmarking clinical tasks.

Result: Researchers successfully showcased the dataset's utility by achieving benchmark results in tumor segmentation, recurrence-free survival prediction, and HPV status classification using advanced machine learning frameworks.

Abstract: We describe a publicly available multimodal dataset of annotated Positron
Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) studies for head and neck
cancer research. The dataset includes 1123 FDG-PET/CT studies from patients
with histologically confirmed head and neck cancer, acquired from 10
international medical centers. All examinations consisted of co-registered
PET/CT scans with varying acquisition protocols, reflecting real-world clinical
diversity across institutions. Primary gross tumor volumes (GTVp) and involved
lymph nodes (GTVn) were manually segmented by experienced radiation oncologists
and radiologists following standardized guidelines and quality control
measures. We provide anonymized NifTi files of all studies, along with
expert-annotated segmentation masks, radiotherapy dose distribution for a
subset of patients, and comprehensive clinical metadata. This metadata includes
TNM staging, HPV status, demographics (age and gender), long-term follow-up
outcomes, survival times, censoring indicators, and treatment information. We
demonstrate how this dataset can be used for three key clinical tasks:
automated tumor segmentation, recurrence-free survival prediction, and HPV
status classification, providing benchmark results using state-of-the-art deep
learning models, including UNet, SegResNet, and multimodal prognostic
frameworks.

### [260] [Two Causes, Not One: Rethinking Omission and Fabrication Hallucinations in MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00371)
*Guangzong Si,Hao Yin,Xianfei Li,Qing Ding,Wenlong Liao,Tao He,Pai Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper tackles the issue of object hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by identifying distinct causes for omission and fabrication hallucinations, and presents a novel calibration method to mitigate these issues effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper is to address the persistent challenge of object hallucination in MLLMs, where current methods fail to differentiate between omission and fabrication hallucinations, often worsening one while attempting to mitigate the other.

Method: The paper proposes the Visual-Semantic Attention Potential Field framework to understand how MLLMs construct visual evidence, and introduces the Visual Potential Field Calibration (VPFC) method. This plug-and-play method aims to reduce omission hallucinations without triggering more fabrication issues.

Result: The proposed VPFC method effectively mitigates omission hallucinations while avoiding additional fabrication hallucinations, demonstrating its practical utility and robustness.

Conclusion: The paper identifies a critical oversight in the understanding of object hallucinations in MLLMs and introduces a new, balanced strategy for mitigating these issues, offering future directions for improving robustness in these systems.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive advances,
yet object hallucination remains a persistent challenge. Existing methods,
based on the flawed assumption that omission and fabrication hallucinations
share a common cause, often reduce omissions only to trigger more fabrications.
In this work, we overturn this view by demonstrating that omission
hallucinations arise from insufficient confidence when mapping perceived visual
features to linguistic expressions, whereas fabrication hallucinations result
from spurious associations within the cross-modal representation space due to
statistical biases in the training corpus. Building on findings from visual
attention intervention experiments, we propose the Visual-Semantic Attention
Potential Field, a conceptual framework that reveals how the model constructs
visual evidence to infer the presence or absence of objects. Leveraging this
insight, we introduce Visual Potential Field Calibration (VPFC), a
plug-and-play hallucination mitigation method that effectively reduces omission
hallucinations without introducing additional fabrication hallucinations. Our
findings reveal a critical oversight in current object hallucination research
and chart new directions for developing more robust and balanced hallucination
mitigation strategies.

### [261] [Activation Steering Meets Preference Optimization: Defense Against Jailbreaks in Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00373)
*Sihao Wu,Gaojie Jin,Wei Huang,Jianhong Wang,Xiaowei Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPO-VLM, a two-stage defense mechanism to improve the robustness of Vision Language Models (VLMs) against adversarial attacks, combining activation steering and policy optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vulnerability of VLMs to adversarial attacks and limitations of existing activation steering methods that degrade performance during visual grounding.

Method: SPO-VLM uses a two-stage defense: Stage I computes adaptive steering vectors for harm suppression, and Stage II employs sequence-level optimization with toxicity assessment and visual-consistency rewards to refine the model.

Result: SPO-VLM improves safety against adversarial attacks and maintains strong performance on benign tasks without degrading visual understanding.

Conclusion: SPO-VLM is an effective and efficient defense framework for VLMs, enhancing robustness while preserving their key functionalities.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
integrating visual and textual information for understanding and reasoning, but
remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While activation steering has
emerged as a promising defence, existing approaches often rely on task-specific
contrastive prompts to extract harmful directions, which exhibit suboptimal
performance and can degrade visual grounding performance. To address these
limitations, we propose \textit{Sequence-Level Preference Optimization} for VLM
(\textit{SPO-VLM}), a novel two-stage defense framework that combines
activation-level intervention with policy-level optimization to enhance model
robustness. In \textit{Stage I}, we compute adaptive layer-specific steering
vectors from diverse data sources, enabling generalized suppression of harmful
behaviors during inference. In \textit{Stage II}, we refine these steering
vectors through a sequence-level preference optimization process. This stage
integrates automated toxicity assessment, as well as visual-consistency rewards
based on caption-image alignment, to achieve safe and semantically grounded
text generation. The two-stage structure of SPO-VLM balances efficiency and
effectiveness by combining a lightweight mitigation foundation in Stage I with
deeper policy refinement in Stage II. Extensive experiments shown SPO-VLM
enhances safety against attacks via activation steering and preference
optimization, while maintaining strong performance on benign tasks without
compromising visual understanding capabilities. We will release our code, model
weights, and evaluation toolkit to support reproducibility and future research.

### [262] [Adaptive Point-Prompt Tuning: Fine-Tuning Heterogeneous Foundation Models for 3D Point Cloud Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00374)
*Mengke Li,Lihao Chen,Peng Zhang,Yiu-ming Cheung,Hui Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents Adaptive Point-Prompt Tuning (APPT), a method for fine-tuning pre-trained foundation models efficiently for 3D point cloud analysis without relying on mappings to other modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Due to the scarcity of 3D point cloud data, pre-training large 3D models is challenging. Existing methods that use "high-to-low" mappings often lose spatial geometry and lack a generalizable framework for adapting any modality to 3D point cloud analysis.

Method: The APPT method involves converting raw point clouds into point embeddings, capturing spatial and permutation-invariant features. It introduces a prompt generator that dynamically produces point-prompts, which are concatenated into frozen pre-trained foundation models, optimizing self-attention across any source modality.

Result: The approach enables direct processing of 3D point clouds, maintains global and local structural information, and reduces computational overhead while ensuring pre-trained models are effectively utilized.

Conclusion: APPT provides a parameter-efficient and effective solution for adapting pre-trained models to 3D point cloud analysis, addressing the limitations of prior methods.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies for foundation models in 1D
textual and 2D visual analysis have demonstrated remarkable efficacy. However,
due to the scarcity of point cloud data, pre-training large 3D models remains a
challenging task. While many efforts have been made to apply pre-trained visual
models to 3D domains through "high-to-low" mapping, these approaches often lead
to the loss of spatial geometries and lack a generalizable framework for
adapting any modality to 3D. This paper, therefore, attempts to directly
leverage point features to calibrate the heterogeneous foundation model of any
modality for 3D point cloud analysis. Specifically, we propose the Adaptive
Point-Prompt Tuning (APPT) method, which fine-tunes pre-trained models with a
modest number of parameters, enabling direct point cloud processing without
heterogeneous mappings. We convert raw point clouds into point embeddings by
aggregating local geometry to capture spatial features followed by linear
layers to ensure seamless utilization of frozen pre-trained models. Given the
inherent disorder of point clouds, in contrast to the structured nature of
images and language, we employ a permutation-invariant feature to capture the
relative positions of point embeddings, thereby obtaining point tokens enriched
with location information to optimize self-attention mechanisms. To calibrate
self-attention across source domains of any modality to 3D and reduce
computational overhead, we introduce a prompt generator that shares weights
with the point embedding module, dynamically producing point-prompts without
adding additional parameters. These prompts are then concatenated into a frozen
foundation model, providing rich global structural information and compensating
for the lack of structural context in the heterogeneous data.

*Shumpei Takezaki,Ryoma Bise,Shinnosuke Matsuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces NoiseCutMix, a novel data augmentation method combining CutMix and diffusion models for more natural, high-resolution image generation. Validation through classification experiments highlights its effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the unnatural boundaries problem in traditional methods like CutMix and MixUp by leveraging diffusion models' strengths for more realistic, high-resolution data augmentation.

Method: Introduce NoiseCutMix, which combines estimated noise from two different classes in a diffusion model to generate fused, high-quality augmented images.

Result: Through classification experiments, NoiseCutMix outperformed conventional augmentation techniques and random generation methods, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: NoiseCutMix successfully provides a natural and effective method for high-resolution image augmentation, overcoming the contextual issues observed in traditional multi-class merging techniques.

Abstract: In this study, we propose a novel data augmentation method that introduces
the concept of CutMix into the generation process of diffusion models, thereby
exploiting both the ability of diffusion models to generate natural and
high-resolution images and the characteristic of CutMix, which combines
features from two classes to create diverse augmented data. Representative data
augmentation methods for combining images from multiple classes include CutMix
and MixUp. However, techniques like CutMix often result in unnatural boundaries
between the two images due to contextual differences. Therefore, in this study,
we propose a method, called NoiseCutMix, to achieve natural, high-resolution
image generation featuring the fused characteristics of two classes by
partially combining the estimated noise corresponding to two different classes
in a diffusion model. In the classification experiments, we verified the
effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing it with conventional data
augmentation techniques that combine multiple classes, random image generation
using Stable Diffusion, and combinations of these methods. Our codes are

### [264] [Domain Adaptation-Based Crossmodal Knowledge Distillation for 3D Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00379)
*Jialiang Kang,Jiawen Wang,Dingsheng Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces two crossmodal knowledge distillation methods (UDAKD and FSKD) to perform 3D LiDAR semantic segmentation without the need for annotated 3D data by leveraging pretrained 2D image models and known 2D-3D correspondence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to reduce the costs and time associated with annotating 3D LiDAR data by utilizing the abundance of real-world image datasets and crossmodal learning techniques.

Method: The approach involves two novel methods, UDAKD and FSKD, which apply knowledge distillation principles to align 2D image models with 3D LiDAR data using pretrained 2D models and leveraging 2D-3D data correspondence. Self-calibrated convolution is utilized to preserve modality-general information during this process.

Result: Their methods demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques in 3D LiDAR semantic segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: Crossmodal knowledge distillation can effectively compensate for the lack of 3D annotations by leveraging synchronized 2D-3D data, providing a cost-efficient and high-performance solution for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of 3D LiDAR data plays a pivotal role in autonomous
driving. Traditional approaches rely on extensive annotated data for point
cloud analysis, incurring high costs and time investments. In contrast,
realworld image datasets offer abundant availability and substantial scale. To
mitigate the burden of annotating 3D LiDAR point clouds, we propose two
crossmodal knowledge distillation methods: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
Knowledge Distillation (UDAKD) and Feature and Semantic-based Knowledge
Distillation (FSKD). Leveraging readily available spatio-temporally
synchronized data from cameras and LiDARs in autonomous driving scenarios, we
directly apply a pretrained 2D image model to unlabeled 2D data. Through
crossmodal knowledge distillation with known 2D-3D correspondence, we actively
align the output of the 3D network with the corresponding points of the 2D
network, thereby obviating the necessity for 3D annotations. Our focus is on
preserving modality-general information while filtering out modality-specific
details during crossmodal distillation. To achieve this, we deploy
self-calibrated convolution on 3D point clouds as the foundation of our domain
adaptation module. Rigorous experimentation validates the effectiveness of our
proposed methods, consistently surpassing the performance of state-of-the-art
approaches in the field.

### [265] [Visually Grounded Narratives: Reducing Cognitive Burden in Researcher-Participant Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00381)
*Runtong Wu,Jiayao Song,Fei Teng,Xianhao Ren,Yuyan Gao,Kailun Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel paradigm called NAME to streamline narrative inquiry by converting research documents into coherent story images, significantly reducing cognitive burden for researchers and participants while demonstrating state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The traditional narrative inquiry process is labor-intensive for both researchers and participants, involving manual narrative drafting and extensive document review. The authors aim to address these inefficiencies by creating a more efficient and participant-friendly approach.

Method: The authors propose NAME, a paradigm that transforms text-based materials into story images. This includes an actor location and shape module for image generation and robust evaluation metrics for assessing perceptual quality and narrative consistency. It also leverages minimal data resources.

Result: Their method significantly reduces the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) score (e.g., 195 to 152 for 100% data) and improves newly introduced metrics for narrative consistency, requiring only 0.96% of the data typically used by baselines.

Conclusion: NAME effectively pushes the frontier of narrative inquiry by enhancing efficiency and inclusivity in the analysis of human experiences while maintaining high-quality results and minimizing data requirements.

Abstract: Narrative inquiry has been one of the prominent application domains for the
analysis of human experience, aiming to know more about the complexity of human
society. However, researchers are often required to transform various forms of
data into coherent hand-drafted narratives in storied form throughout narrative
analysis, which brings an immense burden of data analysis. Participants, too,
are expected to engage in member checking and presentation of these narrative
products, which involves reviewing and responding to large volumes of
documents. Given the dual burden and the need for more efficient and
participant-friendly approaches to narrative making and representation, we made
a first attempt: (i) a new paradigm is proposed, NAME, as the initial attempt
to push the field of narrative inquiry. Name is able to transfer research
documents into coherent story images, alleviating the cognitive burden of
interpreting extensive text-based materials during member checking for both
researchers and participants. (ii) We develop an actor location and shape
module to facilitate plausible image generation. (iii) We have designed a set
of robust evaluation metrics comprising three key dimensions to objectively
measure the perceptual quality and narrative consistency of generated
characters. Our approach consistently demonstrates state-of-the-art performance
across different data partitioning schemes. Remarkably, while the baseline
relies on the full 100% of the available data, our method requires only 0.96%
yet still reduces the FID score from 195 to 152. Under identical data volumes,
our method delivers substantial improvements: for the 70:30 split, the FID
score decreases from 175 to 152, and for the 95:5 split, it is nearly halved
from 96 to 49. Furthermore, the proposed model achieves a score of 3.62 on the
newly introduced metric, surpassing the baseline score of 2.66.

*Joohyun Chang,Soyeon Hong,Hyogun Lee,Seong Jong Ha,Dongho Lee,Seong Tae Kim,Jinwoo Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses egocentric visual query localization in videos with frequent viewpoint changes using a novel method named HERO-VQL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Egocentric videos pose challenges like abrupt viewpoint shifts, object appearance variations, and occlusions, which hinder accurate query localization.

Method: HERO-VQL introduces Top-down Attention Guidance for refined attention and Egocentric Augmentation-based Consistency Training to strengthen learning in diverse scenarios.

Result: Experiments show HERO-VQL significantly outperforms baseline methods on the VQ2D dataset while effectively handling egocentric challenges.

Conclusion: HERO-VQL leverages human cognitive-like processes for enhanced attention and robustness in egocentric query localization, demonstrating superior performance in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: In this work, we tackle the egocentric visual query localization (VQL), where
a model should localize the query object in a long-form egocentric video.
Frequent and abrupt viewpoint changes in egocentric videos cause significant
object appearance variations and partial occlusions, making it difficult for
existing methods to achieve accurate localization. To tackle these challenges,
we introduce Hierarchical, Egocentric and RObust Visual Query Localization
(HERO-VQL), a novel method inspired by human cognitive process in object
recognition. We propose i) Top-down Attention Guidance (TAG) and ii) Egocentric
Augmentation based Consistency Training (EgoACT). Top-down Attention Guidance
refines the attention mechanism by leveraging the class token for high-level
context and principal component score maps for fine-grained localization. To
enhance learning in diverse and challenging matching scenarios, EgoAug enhances
query diversity by replacing the query with a randomly selected corresponding
object from groundtruth annotations and simulates extreme viewpoint changes by
reordering video frames. Additionally, CT loss enforces stable object
localization across different augmentation scenarios. Extensive experiments on
VQ2D dataset validate that HERO-VQL effectively handles egocentric challenges,
significantly outperforming baselines.

### [267] [Double-Constraint Diffusion Model with Nuclear Regularization for Ultra-low-dose PET Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00395)
*Mengxiao Geng,Ran Hong,Bingxuan Li,Qiegen Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Double-Constraint Diffusion Model (DCDM) for ultra-low-dose PET reconstruction to enhance image quality while reducing trainable parameters, improving flexibility across different dose levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ultra-low-dose PET imaging can significantly reduce radiation exposure and examination time but often results in increased noise and compromised quality.

Method: The DCDM integrates trainable double-constraint controllers (NTC and ENC) into a pre-trained diffusion model without fine-tuning all parameters. NTC uses nuclear norm for low-rank property extraction, while ENC encodes information to refine reconstruction in pixel space.

Result: Experiments on UDPET and Clinical datasets show DCDM outperforms existing methods for known and unknown dose reduction factors, even at ultra-low dose levels (1% of full dose).

Conclusion: DCDM is a flexible and effective method for PET reconstruction at ultra-low doses, ensuring high-quality output and generalizing well across dose scenarios.

Abstract: Ultra-low-dose positron emission tomography (PET) reconstruction holds
significant potential for reducing patient radiation exposure and shortening
examination times. However, it may also lead to increased noise and reduced
imaging detail, which could decrease the image quality. In this study, we
present a Double-Constraint Diffusion Model (DCDM), which freezes the weights
of a pre-trained diffusion model and injects a trainable double-constraint
controller into the encoding architecture, greatly reducing the number of
trainable parameters for ultra-low-dose PET reconstruction. Unlike full
fine-tuning models, DCDM can adapt to different dose levels without retraining
all model parameters, thereby improving reconstruction flexibility.
Specifically, the two constraint modules, named the Nuclear Transformer
Constraint (NTC) and the Encoding Nexus Constraint (ENC), serve to refine the
pre-trained diffusion model. The NTC leverages the nuclear norm as an
approximation for matrix rank minimization, integrates the low-rank property
into the Transformer architecture, and enables efficient information extraction
from low-dose images and conversion into compressed feature representations in
the latent space. Subsequently, the ENC utilizes these compressed feature
representations to encode and control the pre-trained diffusion model,
ultimately obtaining reconstructed PET images in the pixel space. In clinical
reconstruction, the compressed feature representations from NTC help select the
most suitable ENC for efficient unknown low-dose PET reconstruction.
Experiments conducted on the UDPET public dataset and the Clinical dataset
demonstrated that DCDM outperforms state-of-the-art methods on known dose
reduction factors (DRF) and generalizes well to unknown DRF scenarios, proving
valuable even at ultra-low dose levels, such as 1% of the full dose.

### [268] [DAOVI: Distortion-Aware Omnidirectional Video Inpainting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00396)
*Ryosuke Seshimo,Mariko Isogawa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces DAOVI, a deep learning model for omnidirectional video inpainting that accounts for geometric distortions and delivers superior performance compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Omnidirectional videos often include unwanted objects due to their wide field of view, which can cause distortion issues when processed by conventional inpainting methods.

Method: The proposed method, DAOVI, incorporates a geodesic distance-aware temporal motion module and a depth-aware feature propagation module to handle distortion in equirectangular projection.

Result: Experimental evaluations reveal that DAOVI surpasses traditional inpainting techniques in both quantitative metrics and visual quality.

Conclusion: DAOVI effectively addresses the challenges of omnidirectional video inpainting, offering improved spatial-temporal coherence and handling geometric distortions efficiently.

Abstract: Omnidirectional videos that capture the entire surroundings are employed in a
variety of fields such as VR applications and remote sensing. However, their
wide field of view often causes unwanted objects to appear in the videos. This
problem can be addressed by video inpainting, which enables the natural removal
of such objects while preserving both spatial and temporal consistency.
Nevertheless, most existing methods assume processing ordinary videos with a
narrow field of view and do not tackle the distortion in equirectangular
projection of omnidirectional videos. To address this issue, this paper
proposes a novel deep learning model for omnidirectional video inpainting,
called Distortion-Aware Omnidirectional Video Inpainting (DAOVI). DAOVI
introduces a module that evaluates temporal motion information in the image
space considering geodesic distance, as well as a depth-aware feature
propagation module in the feature space that is designed to address the
geometric distortion inherent to omnidirectional videos. The experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing methods both
quantitatively and qualitatively.

*Yushuo Chen,Ruizhi Shao,Youxin Pang,Hongwen Zhang,Xinyi Wu,Rihui Wu,Yebin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new framework for creating detailed human avatars from single-camera videos using a generative model for additional data and improved video generation techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent methods fail in either capturing fine details or generating realistic appearances in unseen viewpoints due to limitations in model representation and data availability.

Method: They use an advanced video generative model (Human4DiT) for motion generation from different perspectives, add video fine-tuning for motion consistency, and apply a patch-based denoising algorithm for better resolution.

Result: Experimental results indicate the proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: The approach effectively enhances the creation of human avatars by addressing prior challenges in detail and consistency through innovative strategies.

Abstract: We present a novel framework to reconstruct human avatars from monocular
videos. Recent approaches have struggled either to capture the fine-grained
dynamic details from the input or to generate plausible details at novel
viewpoints, which mainly stem from the limited representational capacity of the
avatar model and insufficient observational data. To overcome these challenges,
we propose to leverage the advanced video generative model, Human4DiT, to
generate the human motions from alternative perspective as an additional
supervision signal. This approach not only enriches the details in previously
unseen regions but also effectively regularizes the avatar representation to
mitigate artifacts. Furthermore, we introduce two complementary strategies to
enhance video generation: To ensure consistent reproduction of human motion, we
inject the physical identity into the model through video fine-tuning. For
higher-resolution outputs with finer details, a patch-based denoising algorithm
is employed. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
recent state-of-the-art approaches and validate the effectiveness of our
proposed strategies.

*Lianyu Hu,Fanhua Shang,Wei Feng,Liang Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents LightVLM, an efficient method to accelerate Vision-Language Models (VLMs) during inference in a training-free way, achieving higher speed and maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiency in current Vision-Language Models during the inference process, necessitating faster deployment and real-world usability.

Method: LightVLM divides the VLM inference process into 'encoding' and 'decoding' stages. It employs pyramid token merging during encoding to reduce token number hierarchically and KV Cache compression during decoding to remove redundant caches.

Result: LightVLM retains full performance with 35% of image tokens, achieves 98% performance with 3% tokens, doubles network throughput, reduces prefilling time by 3.65×, and accelerates inference time by 3.21× for long text sequences.

Conclusion: LightVLM enhances inference speed and efficiency in large VLMs without compromising performance, making them practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce LightVLM, a simple but effective method that can
be seamlessly deployed upon existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to greatly
accelerate the inference process in a training-free manner. We divide the
inference procedure of VLMs into two stages, i.e., encoding and decoding, and
propose to simultaneously accelerate VLMs in both stages to largely improve
model efficiency. During encoding, we propose pyramid token merging to reduce
tokens of different LLM layers in a hierarchical manner by finally only keeping
a few dominant tokens to achieve high efficiency. During decoding, aimed at
reducing the high latency of outputting long sequences, we propose KV Cache
compression to remove unnecessary caches to increase the network throughput.
Experimental results show that LightVLM successfully retains 100% performance
when only preserving 35% image tokens, and maintains around 98% performance
when keeping only 3% image tokens. LightVLM could 2.02$\times$ the network
throughput and reduce the prefilling time by 3.65$\times$. LightVLM also makes
large VLMs faster again by enabling a heavy model (e.g., InternVL2.5 26B) to
infer faster than significantly smaller models (e.g., InternVL2.5 8B),
hopefully facilitating the real-world deployment. When generating long text
sequences (e.g., 4096 tokens), LightVLM could reduce the inference time by
3.21$\times$, largely outperforming existing methods.

*Xuechao Zou,Shun Zhang,Xing Fu,Yue Li,Kai Li,Yushe Cao,Congyan Lang,Pin Tao,Junliang Xing*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Face-MoGLE, a framework for precise and controllable face generation using specialized Diffusion Transformers (DiTs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing face generation models struggle to balance semantic controllability and photorealism, necessitating a new approach to manipulate facial attributes while ensuring high image quality.

Method: Face-MoGLE integrates mask-conditioned latent space factorization, a mixture of global/local experts for structure recognition, and a dynamic gating network for adaptive coefficients during diffusion steps.

Result: Experiments showcase Face-MoGLE's effectiveness in both multimodal and monomodal face generation settings, as well as its robust zero-shot generalization ability.

Conclusion: Face-MoGLE advances controllable face generation by enabling precise attribute manipulation and maintaining photorealistic results, showing promise for generative modeling and security applications.

Abstract: Controllable face generation poses critical challenges in generative modeling
due to the intricate balance required between semantic controllability and
photorealism. While existing approaches struggle with disentangling semantic
controls from generation pipelines, we revisit the architectural potential of
Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) through the lens of expert specialization. This
paper introduces Face-MoGLE, a novel framework featuring: (1)
Semantic-decoupled latent modeling through mask-conditioned space
factorization, enabling precise attribute manipulation; (2) A mixture of global
and local experts that captures holistic structure and region-level semantics
for fine-grained controllability; (3) A dynamic gating network producing
time-dependent coefficients that evolve with diffusion steps and spatial
locations. Face-MoGLE provides a powerful and flexible solution for
high-quality, controllable face generation, with strong potential in generative
modeling and security applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate its
effectiveness in multimodal and monomodal face generation settings and its
robust zero-shot generalization capability. Project page is available at

### [272] [SemaMIL: Semantic Reordering with Retrieval-Guided State Space Modeling for Whole Slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00442)
*Lubin Gan,Xiaoman Wu,Jing Zhang,Zhifeng Wang,Linhao Qu,Siying Wu,Xiaoyan Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes SemaMIL, a novel MIL model incorporating semantic reordering and state space models to address limitations in computational pathology and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome the limitations of MIL methods, such as the inability to capture contextual relationships and issues with computational efficiency and interpretability in WSI analysis.

Method: SemaMIL achieves its objectives by combining Semantic Reordering (SR) for adaptive patch arrangement and a Semantic-guided Retrieval State Space Module (SRSM) for parameter adjustment to enhance global modeling.

Result: SemaMIL demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy on four WSI subtype datasets while utilizing fewer parameters and achieving higher computational efficiency compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: Integrating semantic reordering and state space modules in MIL provides an effective solution to balance accuracy, computational cost, and interpretability in WSI-based computational pathology.

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) has become the leading approach for
extracting discriminative features from whole slide images (WSIs) in
computational pathology. Attention-based MIL methods can identify key patches
but tend to overlook contextual relationships. Transformer models are able to
model interactions but require quadratic computational cost and are prone to
overfitting. State space models (SSMs) offer linear complexity, yet shuffling
patch order disrupts histological meaning and reduces interpretability. In this
work, we introduce SemaMIL, which integrates Semantic Reordering (SR), an
adaptive method that clusters and arranges semantically similar patches in
sequence through a reversible permutation, with a Semantic-guided Retrieval
State Space Module (SRSM) that chooses a representative subset of queries to
adjust state space parameters for improved global modeling. Evaluation on four
WSI subtype datasets shows that, compared to strong baselines, SemaMIL achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy with fewer FLOPs and parameters.

### [273] [Stage-wise Adaptive Label Distribution for Facial Age Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00450)
*Bo Wu,Zhiqi Ai,Jun Jiang,Congcong Zhu,Shugong Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the SA-LDL algorithm to address varying label ambiguity in age estimation tasks, achieving competitive performance results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for age estimation fail to sufficiently address the stage-wise nature of label ambiguity across different age groups.

Method: The proposed SA-LDL algorithm incorporates stage-wise adaptive variance modeling and a weighted loss function to handle varying ambiguities effectively.

Result: The SA-LDL algorithm delivers competitive MAE values of 1.74 and 2.15 on the MORPH-II and FG-NET datasets.

Conclusion: Modeling stage-wise label ambiguity using SA-LDL enhances accuracy and robustness in age estimation tasks.

Abstract: Label ambiguity poses a significant challenge in age estimation tasks. Most
existing methods address this issue by modeling correlations between adjacent
age groups through label distribution learning. However, they often overlook
the varying degrees of ambiguity present across different age stages. In this
paper, we propose a Stage-wise Adaptive Label Distribution Learning (SA-LDL)
algorithm, which leverages the observation -- revealed through our analysis of
embedding similarities between an anchor and all other ages -- that label
ambiguity exhibits clear stage-wise patterns. By jointly employing stage-wise
adaptive variance modeling and weighted loss function, SA-LDL effectively
captures the complex and structured nature of label ambiguity, leading to more
accurate and robust age estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SA-LDL achieves competitive performance, with MAE of 1.74 and 2.15 on the
MORPH-II and FG-NET datasets.

*Xiang Chen,Renjiu Hu,Jinwei Zhang,Yuxi Zhang,Xinyao Yue,Min Liu,Yaonan Wang,Hang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the EOIR framework for deformable image registration focusing on efficiency and accuracy trade-offs using a simplified ConvNet architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome persistent challenges in deformable image registration, such as computational complexity and handling large deformations.

Method: The authors propose the EOIR framework which separates feature learning from flow estimation. It uses a 3-layer ConvNet for feature extraction combined with 3-layer flow estimators to progressively create diffeomorphic deformations based on a Laplacian feature pyramid.

Result: EOIR demonstrates superior performance across five datasets, achieving better trade-offs in accuracy-efficiency and accuracy-smoothness compared to existing techniques.

Conclusion: EOIR provides a streamlined solution for deformable image registration, offering improved efficiency and accuracy. Its source code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Learning-based techniques have significantly improved the accuracy and speed
of deformable image registration. However, challenges such as reducing
computational complexity and handling large deformations persist. To address
these challenges, we analyze how convolutional neural networks (ConvNets)
influence registration performance using the Horn-Schunck optical flow
equation. Supported by prior studies and our empirical experiments, we observe
that ConvNets play two key roles in registration: linearizing local intensities
and harmonizing global contrast variations. Based on these insights, we propose
the Encoder-Only Image Registration (EOIR) framework, designed to achieve a
better accuracy-efficiency trade-off. EOIR separates feature learning from flow
estimation, employing only a 3-layer ConvNet for feature extraction and a set
of 3-layer flow estimators to construct a Laplacian feature pyramid,
progressively composing diffeomorphic deformations under a large-deformation
model. Results on five datasets across different modalities and anatomical
regions demonstrate EOIR's effectiveness, achieving superior
accuracy-efficiency and accuracy-smoothness trade-offs. With comparable
accuracy, EOIR provides better efficiency and smoothness, and vice versa. The
source code of EOIR will be publicly available on

*Juwu Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper uses the Jump-Jump game to explore decision-making abilities in large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide insights into how LLMs handle complex decision-making tasks involving spatial reasoning, physical modeling, and strategy.

Method: The Jump-Jump game mechanics are used as a testbed, focusing on how accurately players (or models) calculate jumping force based on position and distance.

Result: Shows the potential of the Jump-Jump game in analyzing the decision-making competencies of LLMs.

Conclusion: The study makes a case for using simple yet cognitively demanding games like Jump-Jump to reveal LLM capabilities in decision-making.

Abstract: The Jump-Jump game, as a simple yet challenging casual game, provides an
ideal testing environment for studying LLM decision-making capabilities. The
game requires players to precisely control jumping force based on current
position and target platform distance, involving multiple cognitive aspects
including spatial reasoning, physical modeling, and strategic planning. It
illustrates the basic gameplay mechanics of the Jump-Jump game, where the
player character (red circle) must jump across platforms with appropriate force
to maximize score.

### [276] [VideoRewardBench: Comprehensive Evaluation of Multimodal Reward Models for Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00484)
*Zhihong Zhang,Xiaojian Huang,Jin Xu,Zhuodong Luo,Xinzhi Wang,Jiansheng Wei,Xuejin Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces VideoRewardBench, a new comprehensive benchmark for evaluating multimodal reward models (MRMs) in video understanding across four aspects: perception, knowledge, reasoning, and safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for video MRMs lack diversity, evaluation dimensions, and adequate testing of various MRM types, necessitating a more comprehensive benchmarking tool.

Method: The authors created VideoRewardBench with an AI-assisted data pipeline, assembling a dataset of 1,563 annotated samples (videos and questions). They evaluated 28 multimodal reward models across generative, discriminative, and semi-scalar categories.

Result: Top-performing models like GPT-4o achieved only 57.0% accuracy, and state-of-the-art open-source models reached 53.3%. Insights showed that reinforcement learning doesn't guarantee stronger generalization and that inference-time scaling benefits most but not all model types.

Conclusion: VideoRewardBench serves as a challenging and valuable benchmark for advancing the evaluation and training of video-specific multimodal reward models.

Abstract: Multimodal reward models (MRMs) play a crucial role in the training,
inference, and evaluation of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) by assessing
response quality. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating MRMs in the video
domain suffer from a limited number and diversity of questions, a lack of
comprehensive evaluation dimensions, and inadequate evaluation of diverse types
of MRMs. To address these gaps, we introduce VideoRewardBench, the first
comprehensive benchmark covering four core aspects of video understanding:
perception, knowledge, reasoning, and safety. Through our AI-assisted data
pipeline, we curate a high-quality preference dataset of 1,563 annotated
samples, including 1,482 unique videos and 1,559 distinct questions--15 times
the number found in the most question-rich prior benchmark. Each sample is a
triplet consisting of a video-text prompt, a chosen response, and a rejected
response. We also conduct a comprehensive evaluation across 28 multimodal
reward models spanning three categories: generative, discriminative, and
semi-scalar. Results show that even the top-performing model GPT-4o achieves
only 57.0% overall accuracy, and the state-of-the-art open-source model
Qwen2.5-VL-72B reaches merely 53.3%. Our analysis further reveals three key
insights: (i) MRMs trained with reinforcement learning (RL) do not necessarily
exhibit stronger cross-modal generalization than those trained without RL; (ii)
except for discriminative MRMs, other types of MRMs across varying model
capacities can benefit from inference-time scaling; and (iii) variations in
input video frame count have different effects on different types of MRMs. We
believe VideoRewardBench offers a challenging and valuable benchmark for
advancing the evaluation and development of MRMs in the video domain.

### [277] [Multi-Focused Video Group Activities Hashing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00490)
*Zhongmiao Qi,Yan Jiang,Bolin Zhang,Lijun Guo,Chong Wang,Qiangbo Qian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces STVH and M-STVH to retrieve group activities in videos by leveraging spatiotemporal dynamics and hierarchical feature integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional video retrieval methods fail to focus on specific activity granularity in the presence of growing complex video data.

Method: The paper proposes STVH to model spatiotemporal evolutions of group and individual features, and an enhanced M-STVH utilizes multi-focused representation learning.

Result: Experiments on public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of both STVH and M-STVH for group activity video retrieval.

Conclusion: The proposed methods improve video retrieval by addressing activity-specific and object-specific feature needs, achieving promising results.

Abstract: With the explosive growth of video data in various complex scenarios, quickly
retrieving group activities has become an urgent problem. However, many tasks
can only retrieve videos focusing on an entire video, not the activity
granularity. To solve this problem, we propose a new STVH (spatiotemporal
interleaved video hashing) technique for the first time. Through a unified
framework, the STVH simultaneously models individual object dynamics and group
interactions, capturing the spatiotemporal evolution on both group visual
features and positional features. Moreover, in real-life video retrieval
scenarios, it may sometimes require activity features, while at other times, it
may require visual features of objects. We then further propose a novel M-STVH
(multi-focused spatiotemporal video hashing) as an enhanced version to handle
this difficult task. The advanced method incorporates hierarchical feature
integration through multi-focused representation learning, allowing the model
to jointly focus on activity semantics features and object visual features. We
conducted comparative experiments on publicly available datasets, and both STVH
and M-STVH can achieve excellent results.

### [278] [TRUST: Token-dRiven Ultrasound Style Transfer for Cross-Device Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00508)
*Nhat-Tuong Do-Tran,Ngoc-Hoang-Lam Le,Ian Chiu,Po-Tsun Paul Kuo,Ching-Chun Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces TRUST, a token-driven framework for ultrasound image translation, improving style alignment and performance of downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ultrasound images vary in style across devices, which reduces performance in downstream tasks. The goal is to address this style gap effectively.

Method: The proposed method, TRUST, uses a dual-stream framework with a Token-Driven (TR) module to selectively transfer target domain styles while preserving source content.

Result: Experiments show that TRUST improves visual quality and downstream task performance on ultrasound datasets compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: TRUST demonstrates better alignment of style transfer to downstream needs, balancing image content preservation and visual translation quality.

Abstract: Ultrasound images acquired from different devices exhibit diverse styles,
resulting in decreased performance of downstream tasks. To mitigate the style
gap, unpaired image-to-image (UI2I) translation methods aim to transfer images
from a source domain, corresponding to new device acquisitions, to a target
domain where a frozen task model has been trained for downstream applications.
However, existing UI2I methods have not explicitly considered filtering the
most relevant style features, which may result in translated images misaligned
with the needs of downstream tasks. In this work, we propose TRUST, a
token-driven dual-stream framework that preserves source content while
transferring the common style of the target domain, ensuring that content and
style remain unblended. Given multiple styles in the target domain, we
introduce a Token-dRiven (TR) module that operates from two perspectives: (1) a
data view--selecting "suitable" target tokens corresponding to each source
token, and (2) a model view--identifying ``optimal" target tokens for the
downstream model, guided by a behavior mirror loss. Additionally, we inject
auxiliary prompts into the source encoder to match content representation with
downstream behavior. Experimental results on ultrasound datasets demonstrate
that TRUST outperforms existing UI2I methods in both visual quality and
downstream task performance.

*Yasser Benigmim,Subhankar Roy,Khalid Oublal,Imad Eddine Marouf,Slim Essid,Vicky Kalogeiton,Stéphane Lathuilière*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel method for adapting local models using black-box AI APIs, a setting where existing domain adaptation methods fail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of training local models using pre-trained black-box AI models that do not reveal internal details, such as weights or training data.

Method: The method, called ATtention-Guided sCaler (ATGC), exploits attention maps and entropy-based scoring to adapt input resolutions dynamically for effective pseudo-labeling and efficient distillation.

Result: Significant improvements in performance were achieved under black-box conditions across multiple datasets, relying only on one-hot predictions from the API model.

Conclusion: The study offers a scalable solution for adapting local models using black-box AI APIs under realistic constraints, overcoming the 'curse of resolution' challenge.

Abstract: The rise of Artificial Intelligence as a Service (AIaaS) democratizes access
to pre-trained models via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), but also
raises a fundamental question: how can local models be effectively trained
using black-box models that do not expose their weights, training data, or
logits, a constraint in which current domain adaptation paradigms are
impractical ? To address this challenge, we introduce the Black-Box
Distillation (B2D) setting, which enables local model adaptation under
realistic constraints: (1) the API model is open-vocabulary and trained on
large-scale general-purpose data, and (2) access is limited to one-hot
predictions only. We identify that open-vocabulary models exhibit significant
sensitivity to input resolution, with different object classes being segmented
optimally at different scales, a limitation termed the "curse of resolution".
Our method, ATtention-Guided sCaler (ATGC), addresses this challenge by
leveraging DINOv2 attention maps to dynamically select optimal scales for
black-box model inference. ATGC scores the attention maps with entropy to
identify informative scales for pseudo-labelling, enabling effective
distillation. Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements under black-box
supervision across multiple datasets while requiring only one-hot API
predictions. Our code is available at https://github.com/yasserben/ATGC.

*Ruitao Wu,Yifan Zhao,Jia Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses Class-Incremental Semantic Segmentation (CISS) challenges by proposing a Language-inspired Bootstrapped Disentanglement framework (LBD), achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to solve the challenges in CISS, namely Prototype-Feature Entanglement and Background-Increment Entanglement, which arise due to semantic misalignment and data dynamics during incremental learning.

Method: The authors introduce the LBD framework that uses pre-trained visual-language models (like CLIP) for Language-guided Prototypical Disentanglement and Manifold Mutual Background Disentanglement. Soft prompt tuning and encoder adaptation modifications are also incorporated.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets Pascal VOC and ADE20k, particularly excelling in multi-step incremental learning scenarios.

Conclusion: By leveraging the language-guided design and disentanglement strategies, the paper significantly mitigates semantic entanglement, offering an effective solution for advancing CISS tasks in a robust manner.

Abstract: Class-Incremental Semantic Segmentation (CISS) requires continuous learning
of newly introduced classes while retaining knowledge of past classes. By
abstracting mainstream methods into two stages (visual feature extraction and
prototype-feature matching), we identify a more fundamental challenge termed
catastrophic semantic entanglement. This phenomenon involves Prototype-Feature
Entanglement caused by semantic misalignment during the incremental process,
and Background-Increment Entanglement due to dynamic data evolution. Existing
techniques, which rely on visual feature learning without sufficient cues to
distinguish targets, introduce significant noise and errors. To address these
issues, we introduce a Language-inspired Bootstrapped Disentanglement framework
(LBD). We leverage the prior class semantics of pre-trained visual-language
models (e.g., CLIP) to guide the model in autonomously disentangling features
through Language-guided Prototypical Disentanglement and Manifold Mutual
Background Disentanglement. The former guides the disentangling of new
prototypes by treating hand-crafted text features as topological templates,
while the latter employs multiple learnable prototypes and mask-pooling-based
supervision for background-incremental class disentanglement. By incorporating
soft prompt tuning and encoder adaptation modifications, we further bridge the
capability gap of CLIP between dense and sparse tasks, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on both Pascal VOC and ADE20k, particularly in
multi-step scenarios.

*Peirong Liu,Oula Puonti,Xiaoling Hu,Karthik Gopinath,Annabel Sorby-Adams,Daniel C. Alexander,W. Taylor Kimberly,Juan E. Iglesias*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BrainFM introduces a modality-agnostic, multi-task vision foundation model for human brain imaging, addressing challenges in uncalibrated imaging modalities such as MRI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the lack of generalizability of learning-based models in uncalibrated brain imaging modalities like MRI due to sensitivity to imaging differences.

Method: The approach involves a 'mild-to-severe' intra-subject generation and a 'real-synth' mix-up training strategy to ensure the model is resilient to imaging variations.

Result: BrainFM demonstrates robustness and effectiveness across five brain imaging tasks (e.g., segmentation, image synthesis) and performs well across eleven public datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed model significantly improves the generalizability and applicability of learning-based methods for diverse brain imaging tasks and protocols.

Abstract: Recent learning-based approaches have made astonishing advances in calibrated
medical imaging like computerized tomography (CT), yet they struggle to
generalize in uncalibrated modalities -- notably magnetic resonance (MR)
imaging, where performance is highly sensitive to the differences in MR
contrast, resolution, and orientation. This prevents broad applicability to
diverse real-world clinical protocols. Here we introduce BrainFM, a
modality-agnostic, multi-task vision foundation model for human brain imaging.
With the proposed "mild-to-severe" intra-subject generation and "real-synth"
mix-up training strategy, BrainFM is resilient to the appearance of acquired
images (e.g., modality, contrast, deformation, resolution, artifacts), and can
be directly applied to five fundamental brain imaging tasks, including image
synthesis for CT and T1w/T2w/FLAIR MRI, anatomy segmentation, scalp-to-cortical
distance, bias field estimation, and registration. We evaluate the efficacy of
BrainFM on eleven public datasets, and demonstrate its robustness and
effectiveness across all tasks and input modalities. Code is available at

*Abdellah Zakaria Sellam,Ilyes Benaissa,Salah Eddine Bekhouche,Abdenour Hadid,Vito Renó,Cosimo Distante*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Context-Aware Fusion (CAF), a method using cross-attention and global context for enhanced object detection in complex visual tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current object detection methods, like DiffusionDet, struggle in integrating global scene understanding in context-dependent scenarios, especially in challenging domains like vehicle damage assessment.

Method: The authors propose CAF, which combines global scene context with local features using a dedicated encoder and cross-attention mechanisms, allowing object proposals to incorporate comprehensive environmental information.

Result: CAF outperforms state-of-the-art object detection models on the CarDD benchmark, achieving new best results in this domain.

Conclusion: Integrating global scene context with local object features significantly advances performance in fine-grained and context-rich object detection settings.

Abstract: Fine-grained object detection in challenging visual domains, such as vehicle
damage assessment, presents a formidable challenge even for human experts to
resolve reliably. While DiffusionDet has advanced the state-of-the-art through
conditional denoising diffusion, its performance remains limited by local
feature conditioning in context-dependent scenarios. We address this
fundamental limitation by introducing Context-Aware Fusion (CAF), which
leverages cross-attention mechanisms to integrate global scene context with
local proposal features directly. The global context is generated using a
separate dedicated encoder that captures comprehensive environmental
information, enabling each object proposal to attend to scene-level
understanding. Our framework significantly enhances the generative detection
paradigm by enabling each object proposal to attend to comprehensive
environmental information. Experimental results demonstrate an improvement over
state-of-the-art models on the CarDD benchmark, establishing new performance
benchmarks for context-aware object detection in fine-grained domains

*Boyi Li,Ce Zhang,Richard M. Timmerman,Wenxuan Bao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DGL-RSIS, a framework to adapt vision-language models (VLMs) for remote sensing image segmentation, overcoming challenges like domain gap and limited categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome the challenges involved in transferring vision-language models (VLMs) from natural imagery to remote sensing segmentation due to domain mismatch and limited data diversity.

Method: The framework decouples visual and textual inputs into local and global contexts, aligns features at both scales, refines image-text matching strategies, and employs Grad-CAM for contextual enhancement and mask selection.

Result: The proposed framework achieves visually accurate and interpretable alignments for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) and referring expression segmentation (RES) in RS images.

Conclusion: DGL-RSIS advances multimodal understanding by enabling effective VLM adaptation for remote sensing segmentation through innovative textual-visual alignment and segmentation strategies.

Abstract: The emergence of vision language models (VLMs) has bridged vision and
language, enabling joint multimodal understanding beyond traditional
visual-only deep learning models. However, transferring VLMs from the natural
image domain to remote sensing (RS) segmentation remains challenging due to the
limited category diversity in RS datasets and the domain gap between natural
and RS imagery. Here, we propose a training-free framework, DGL-RSIS, that
decouples visual and textual inputs, performing visual-language alignment at
both the local semantic and global contextual levels through tailored
strategies. Specifically, we first introduce a global-local decoupling (GLD)
module, where text inputs are divided into local class nouns and global
modifiers using natural language processing (NLP) techniques; image inputs are
partitioned into a set of class-agnostic mask proposals via unsupervised mask
proposal networks. Second, visual and textual features are aligned at local
scale, through a novel context-aware cropping strategy for extracting image
patches with proper boundaries and introducing RS-specific knowledge to enrich
the text inputs. By matching the enhanced text features with mask-guided visual
features, we enable the mask classification, supporting open-vocabulary
semantic segmentation (OVSS). Third, at the global scale, we propose a
Cross-Scale Grad-CAM module to refine Grad-CAM maps using contextual
information from global modifiers. A subsequent mask selection module
integrates pixel-level Grad-CAM activations into the mask-level segmentation
output, such that accurate and interpretable alignment can be realized across
global and local dimensions for referring expression segmentation (RES).

*Maggie Chen,Hala Lambdouar,Luca Marini,Laura Martínez-Ferrer,Chris Bridges,Giacomo Acciarini*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a machine learning-based methane detection method using unorthorectified satellite data, achieving comparable performance to traditional methods. Datasets and code are publicly available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Methane is a significant greenhouse gas, and its quick detection is vital for effective climate change mitigation. Deploying ML on satellites can enhance detection speed and reduce data transmission costs.

Method: The authors developed ML models to process unorthorectified data (UnorthoDOS) directly, bypassing conventional preprocessing steps. They compared its performance to orthorectified data methods and a matched filter baseline.

Result: ML models trained on unorthorectified data achieve comparable performance to orthorectified data. Additionally, models trained on orthorectified data outperform traditional matched filter baselines.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the viability of using unorthorectified data for methane detection while providing publicly accessible datasets and code to encourage further research.

Abstract: Methane is a potent greenhouse gas and a major driver of climate change,
making its timely detection critical for effective mitigation. Machine learning
(ML) deployed onboard satellites can enable rapid detection while reducing
downlink costs, supporting faster response systems. Conventional methane
detection methods often rely on image processing techniques, such as
orthorectification to correct geometric distortions and matched filters to
enhance plume signals. We introduce a novel approach that bypasses these
preprocessing steps by using \textit{unorthorectified} data (UnorthoDOS). We
find that ML models trained on this dataset achieve performance comparable to
those trained on orthorectified data. Moreover, we also train models on an
orthorectified dataset, showing that they can outperform the matched filter
baseline (mag1c). We release model checkpoints and two ML-ready datasets
comprising orthorectified and unorthorectified hyperspectral images from the
Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) sensor at
https://huggingface.co/datasets/SpaceML/UnorthoDOS , along with code at

### [285] [MV-SSM: Multi-View State Space Modeling for 3D Human Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00649)
*Aviral Chharia,Wenbo Gou,Haoye Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MV-SSM, a Multi-View State Space Modeling framework, to improve 3D human pose estimation with better generalization across camera setups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for multi-view 3D human pose estimation often fail to adapt to new camera configurations and occluded scenarios, leading to significant performance drops in such cases.

Method: The paper proposes MV-SSM, which explicitly models spatial sequences at the feature and keypoint levels. It introduces the Projective State Space (PSS) block to ensure a generalized spatial representation and employs a Grid Token-guided Bidirectional Scanning (GTBS) technique for better integration.

Result: MV-SSM outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a notable margin in various metrics: +10.8 AP25 (+24%) on CMU Panoptic's three-camera setting, +7.0 AP25 (+13%) for varying camera setups, and +15.3 PCP (+38%) in cross-dataset evaluations like Campus A1.

Conclusion: The proposed MV-SSM framework demonstrates strong generalization and robustness, setting new performance benchmarks for multi-view 3D pose estimation in diverse camera configurations.

Abstract: While significant progress has been made in single-view 3D human pose
estimation, multi-view 3D human pose estimation remains challenging,
particularly in terms of generalizing to new camera configurations. Existing
attention-based transformers often struggle to accurately model the spatial
arrangement of keypoints, especially in occluded scenarios. Additionally, they
tend to overfit specific camera arrangements and visual scenes from training
data, resulting in substantial performance drops in new settings. In this
study, we introduce a novel Multi-View State Space Modeling framework, named
MV-SSM, for robustly estimating 3D human keypoints. We explicitly model the
joint spatial sequence at two distinct levels: the feature level from
multi-view images and the person keypoint level. We propose a Projective State

*Jose Manuel Alcalde-Llergo,Aurora Ruiz-Mezcua,Rocio Avila-Ramirez,Andrea Zingoni,Juri Taborri,Enrique Yeguas-Bolivar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a neural network-based approach for automatic identification and description of jewelry, enabling translators and interpreters to access comprehensive information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Translators and interpreters require precise information about jewelry, which is often accessible only to industry experts and challenging due to diverse styles and designs.

Method: The study uses neural networks for jewelry analysis, utilizing computer vision and image captioning to provide hierarchical natural language descriptions of jewelry pieces.

Result: The final model demonstrated captioning accuracy exceeding 90%, showcasing its effectiveness in recognizing and describing diverse jewelry types.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides an efficient solution for accurately identifying and describing jewelry, benefiting non-experts like translators and interpreters.

Abstract: Identifying jewelry pieces presents a significant challenge due to the wide
range of styles and designs. Currently, precise descriptions are typically
limited to industry experts. However, translators and interpreters often
require a comprehensive understanding of these items. In this study, we
introduce an innovative approach to automatically identify and describe jewelry
using neural networks. This method enables translators and interpreters to
quickly access accurate information, aiding in resolving queries and gaining
essential knowledge about jewelry. Our model operates at three distinct levels
of description, employing computer vision techniques and image captioning to
emulate expert analysis of accessories. The key innovation involves generating
natural language descriptions of jewelry across three hierarchical levels,
capturing nuanced details of each piece. Different image captioning
architectures are utilized to detect jewels in images and generate descriptions
with varying levels of detail. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
in recognizing diverse types of jewelry, we assembled a comprehensive database
of accessory images. The evaluation process involved comparing various image
captioning architectures, focusing particularly on the encoder decoder model,
crucial for generating descriptive captions. After thorough evaluation, our
final model achieved a captioning accuracy exceeding 90 per cent.

### [288] [Fusion to Enhance: Fusion Visual Encoder to Enhance Multimodal Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00664)
*Yifei She,Huangxuan Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Existing multimodal models excel at semantic understanding but fail at detailed visual tasks due to reliance on single vision encoders. This paper introduces the "Fusion to Enhance (FtZ)" framework, combining two types of encoders to address this limitation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal large language models struggle with fine-grained visual perception, a problem stemming from their reliance on a single vision encoder optimized for semantic understanding.

Method: The study introduces the Fusion to Enhance framework, which combines a semantically powerful anchor encoder and a perception-rich augmenting encoder using a Multi-Head Cross-Attention mechanism.

Result: The FtZ framework significantly outperforms previous models on benchmarks requiring fine-grained visual understanding, such as TextVQA and other challenging datasets.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that combining heterogeneous encoders overcomes limitations in visual perception in current models and suggests this as a new paradigm for developing advanced AI systems with stronger perceptual abilities.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in
bridging visual perception with high-level textual reasoning. However, they
face a fundamental contradiction: while excelling at complex semantic
understanding, these models often fail at basic visual tasks that require
precise detail perception. This deficiency primarily stems from the prevalent
architectural reliance on a single vision encoder optimized for high-level
semantic alignment, which inherently sacrifices the ability to capture
fine-grained visual information. To address this issue, we introduce Fusion to
Enhance (FtZ), a novel vision tower framework. FtZ moves beyond the
single-encoder design by innovatively composing a semantically powerful anchor
encoder with a perception-rich augmenting encoder via a lightweight Multi-Head
Cross-Attention mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that on several
challenging benchmarks demanding fine-grained visual understanding, such as
TextVQA, POPE, MMMU, MME and MM-Vet, our FtZ model significantly outperforms
baselines that use only a single encoder or existing feature fusion methods.
This work proves that composing heterogeneous expert encoders is an efficient
and effective path to overcoming the visual perception bottleneck in current
MLLMs, offering a new design paradigm for building next-generation AI systems
with stronger perceptual capabilities.

### [289] [ER-LoRA: Effective-Rank Guided Adaptation for Weather-Generalized Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00665)
*Weilong Yan,Xin Zhang,Robby T. Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses monocular depth estimation under adverse weather by combining Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) and Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) for generalization. A novel STM strategy is introduced to balance adaptation and knowledge retention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular depth estimation faces challenges in adverse weather due to difficulties with obtaining reliable ground truth and the reliance on domain-specific synthetic or self-supervised data that fails to generalize.

Method: A novel STM strategy is developed that decomposes VFM pretrained weights using entropy-rank and stable-rank metrics, enabling adaptive task-aware tuning while preserving learned features. The method employs rank-selection, directional initialization, and direction-based regularization for optimization.

Result: Experiments on diverse weather benchmarks show the proposed STM approach outperforms existing PEFT techniques, full fine-tuning methods, and even models relying on synthetic adverse-weather data.

Conclusion: The proposed STM strategy effectively improves monocular depth estimation under adverse weather by leveraging pretrained VFMs, preserving generalization capabilities, and enhancing task-specific effectiveness.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation under adverse weather conditions (e.g.\ rain, fog,
snow, and nighttime) remains highly challenging due to the lack of reliable
ground truth and the difficulty of learning from unlabeled real-world data.
Existing methods often rely on synthetic adverse data with pseudo-labels, which
suffer from domain gaps, or employ self-supervised learning, which violates
photometric assumptions in adverse scenarios. In this work, we propose to
achieve weather--generalized depth estimation by Parameter--Efficient
Fine--Tuning (PEFT) of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), using only a small
amount of high--visibility (normal) data. While PEFT has shown strong
performance in semantic tasks such as segmentation, it remains underexplored
for geometry--centric tasks like depth estimation -- especially in terms of
balancing effective adaptation with the preservation of pretrained knowledge.
To this end, we introduce the Selecting--Tuning--Maintaining (STM) strategy,
which structurally decomposes the pretrained weights of VFMs based on two kinds
of effective ranks (entropy--rank and stable--rank). In the tuning phase, we
adaptively select the proper rank number as well as the task--aware singular
directions for initialization, based on the entropy--rank and full--tuned
weight; while in the maintaining stage, we enforce a principal direction
regularization based on the stable--rank. This design guarantees flexible task
adaptation while preserving the strong generalization capability of the
pretrained VFM. Extensive experiments on four real--world benchmarks across
diverse weather conditions demonstrate that STM not only outperforms existing
PEFT methods and full fine--tuning but also surpasses methods trained with
adverse synthetic data, and even the depth foundation model

*Xiyao Wang,Chunyuan Li,Jianwei Yang,Kai Zhang,Bo Liu,Tianyi Xiong,Furong Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces LLaVA-Critic-R1, a multimodal model that uniquely combines the ability to evaluate outputs and generate responses, showcasing state-of-the-art performance in both tasks and offering scalability for self-improving systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to challenge the conventional separation of critic models (used for evaluation) and policy models (used for response generation) in vision-language tasks, with the aim of creating a unified model capable of excelling at both.

Method: The authors reorganized preference-labeled critic datasets into usable training signals and applied reinforcement learning directly to a base generative model, leading to the creation of LLaVA-Critic-R1. They further extended this to strong reasoning models, forming LLaVA-Critic-R1+.

Result: LLaVA-Critic-R1 emerged as a top-performing model for both evaluation and response generation, surpassing domain-specific models by +5.7% on average. Its extension, LLaVA-Critic-R1+, achieved state-of-the-art results in visual reasoning and understanding benchmarks. Applying self-critique during inference led to an additional +13.8% improvement without retraining.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning on critic data can successfully produce unified multimodal systems that excel in both evaluation and response generation. This demonstrates the viability of a scalable, self-improving approach for vision-language modeling.

Abstract: In vision-language modeling, critic models are typically trained to evaluate
outputs -- assigning scalar scores or pairwise preferences -- rather than to
generate responses. This separation from policy models, which produce the
responses, is so entrenched that critics are rarely considered for direct
policy use. In this work, we challenge this convention. We propose to
reorganize preference-labeled critic datasets into verifiable training signals
and perform reinforcement learning directly on a base generative model,
producing LLaVA-Critic-R1, a multimodal critic trained to optimize preference
judgments while retaining full generation ability. Surprisingly,
LLaVA-Critic-R1 emerges not only as a top-performing critic but also as a
competitive policy model -- matching or surpassing specialized reasoning VLMs
trained with in-domain data across 26 visual reasoning and understanding
benchmarks, with an average gain of +5.7% over its base model (Qwen-2.5-VL-7B).
Extending this approach to existing strong reasoning VLMs yields
LLaVA-Critic-R1+, which further advances policy performance without sacrificing
critic quality, achieving a SoTA performance of 71.9 on MMMU at the 7B scale.
Finally, we show that the enhanced critic ability benefits inference: applying
self-critique at test time yields an average +13.8% improvement on five
representative reasoning tasks without additional training. Our results reveal
that RL training on critic data can produce a unified model excelling at both
evaluation and generation, offering a simple path toward scalable,
self-improving multimodal systems.

*Qingyu Wang,Xue Jiang,Guozheng Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes the CSFMamba Network for remote sensing image classification, leveraging Mamba's low computational requirements and CNN for multimodal feature fusion. It outperforms Transformer models while reducing computational burdens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of quadratic computational complexity in prior methods for remote sensing image classification, which makes it hard to model long-range spatial-spectral dependencies effectively.

Method: The authors propose the CSFMamba Network, which integrates the Mamba operator with CNN to preprocess remote sensing image data and extract multi-layer features. It creatively uses a cross-state module for efficient fusion of information across modalities, specifically HSI and LiDAR data.

Result: Experimental results on the MUUFL and Houston2018 datasets show that the CSFMamba Network surpasses Transformer models in performance while significantly reducing the network training burden.

Conclusion: The CSFMamba Network successfully combines the strengths of Mamba and CNN to achieve efficient multimodal feature fusion, setting a new standard in remote sensing image classification with reduced computational demands.

Abstract: Multimodal fusion has made great progress in the field of remote sensing
image classification due to its ability to exploit the complementary
spatial-spectral information. Deep learning methods such as CNN and Transformer
have been widely used in these domains. State Space Models recently highlighted
that prior methods suffer from quadratic computational complexity. As a result,
modeling longer-range dependencies of spatial-spectral features imposes an
overwhelming burden on the network. Mamba solves this problem by incorporating
time-varying parameters into ordinary SSM and performing hardware optimization,
but it cannot perform feature fusion directly. In order to make full use of
Mamba's low computational burden and explore the potential of internal
structure in multimodal feature fusion, we propose Cross State Fusion Mamba
(CSFMamba) Network. Specifically, we first design the preprocessing module of
remote sensing image information for the needs of Mamba structure, and combine
it with CNN to extract multi-layer features. Secondly, a cross-state module
based on Mamba operator is creatively designed to fully fuse the feature of the
two modalities. The advantages of Mamba and CNN are combined by designing a
more powerful backbone. We capture the fusion relationship between HSI and
LiDAR modalities with stronger full-image understanding. The experimental
results on two datasets of MUUFL and Houston2018 show that the proposed method
outperforms the experimental results of Transformer under the premise of
reducing the network training burden.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CascadeFormer, a two-stage cascading transformer framework for skeleton-based human action recognition, achieving competitive results across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to explore advanced models like transformers and masked pretraining frameworks for skeleton-based action recognition beyond the commonly used Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs).

Method: CascadeFormer involves a two-stage process: a masked pretraining stage for general skeleton representation learning, followed by a fine-tuning stage for action classification.

Result: CascadeFormer demonstrated competitive performance on three benchmark datasets: Penn Action, N-UCLA, and NTU RGB+D 60.

Conclusion: The proposed CascadeFormer framework effectively learns skeleton representations and achieves strong results in human action recognition. Code and model checkpoints are made publicly available to support reproducibility.

Abstract: Skeleton-based human action recognition leverages sequences of human joint
coordinates to identify actions performed in videos. Owing to the intrinsic
spatiotemporal structure of skeleton data, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)
have been the dominant architecture in this field. However, recent advances in
transformer models and masked pretraining frameworks open new avenues for
representation learning. In this work, we propose CascadeFormer, a family of
two-stage cascading transformers for skeleton-based human action recognition.
Our framework consists of a masked pretraining stage to learn generalizable
skeleton representations, followed by a cascading fine-tuning stage tailored
for discriminative action classification. We evaluate CascadeFormer across
three benchmark datasets (Penn Action N-UCLA, and NTU RGB+D 60), achieving
competitive performance on all tasks. To promote reproducibility, we release
our code and model checkpoints.

*Raehyuk Jung,Seungjun Yu,Hyunjung Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the generalization ability of the projection layer in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to unseen visual concepts, introducing a novel benchmark and finding it retains 79-88% performance on unseen classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The projection layer in VLMs, which maps visual features into a language model's space, is critical but its generalization ability to unseen concepts has not been systematically assessed.

Method: The authors designed a benchmark using object detection datasets with disjoint train/test label splits and analyzed projection layer generalization using mechanistic interpretability methods.

Result: The projection layer demonstrated 79-88% of the performance on unseen visual classes compared to seen ones, indicating significant generalization.

Conclusion: The study provides a new framework to evaluate alignment generalization, revealing potential for VLM training with less aligned data and offering insights into the projection layer's role.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) combine a vision encoder and a large language
model (LLM) through alignment training, showing strong performance on
multimodal tasks. A central component in this architecture is the projection
layer, which maps visual features into the LLM's embedding space. Despite its
importance, its ability to generalize to unseen visual concepts has not been
systematically evaluated. To address this, we propose a benchmark for
evaluating projection-layer generalization. We adapt object detection datasets
(rich in fine-grained annotations) into a prompting format and design
train/test splits with disjoint label sets, enabling precise control over seen
and unseen concept separation. Experimental results show that the projection
layer retains about 79 to 88 percent of the performance on unseen classes
compared to seen ones across various settings, suggesting a non-trivial level
of generalization even without explicit alignment supervision on those
concepts. We further analyze this behavior through a mechanistic
interpretability lens. Our findings indicate that the feed-forward network in
the projection layer functions like a key-value memory, processing seen and
unseen tokens in similar ways. This study introduces a new evaluation framework
for alignment generalization and highlights the potential for efficient VLM
training with limited aligned data.

*Kuniko Paxton,Koorosh Aslansefat,Dhavalkumar Thakker,Yiannis Papadopoulos,Tanaya Maslekar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a fairness algorithm to reduce bias in skin lesion classification models related to skin tones, focusing computational resources on lesion areas while addressing fairness challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns remain about biases related to skin color in skin lesion classification models, which impact equitable and accurate diagnostic outcomes.

Method: The fairness algorithm calculates skewness in feature maps of VGG and Vision Transformer networks, removing channels associated with skin tone while reducing computational costs.

Result: The proposed approach mitigates skin tone bias in classification models, reduces model size, and maintains practicality for real-world medical applications.

Conclusion: The solution provides a feasible way of achieving fairness in skin lesion diagnosis across varying skin tones without relying on traditional statistical fairness verification methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved the accuracy of
skin lesion classification models, supporting medical diagnoses and promoting
equitable healthcare. However, concerns remain about potential biases related
to skin color, which can impact diagnostic outcomes. Ensuring fairness is
challenging due to difficulties in classifying skin tones, high computational
demands, and the complexity of objectively verifying fairness. To address these
challenges, we propose a fairness algorithm for skin lesion classification that
overcomes the challenges associated with achieving diagnostic fairness across
varying skin tones. By calculating the skewness of the feature map in the
convolution layer of the VGG (Visual Geometry Group) network and the patches
and the heads of the Vision Transformer, our method reduces unnecessary
channels related to skin tone, focusing instead on the lesion area. This
approach lowers computational costs and mitigates bias without relying on
conventional statistical methods. It potentially reduces model size while
maintaining fairness, making it more practical for real-world applications.

### [295] [Causal Interpretation of Sparse Autoencoder Features in Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00749)
*Sangyu Han,Yearim Kim,Nojun Kwak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CaFE, a method leveraging Effective Receptive Field (ERF), provides more faithful explanations of sparse auto-encoder (SAE) features in vision transformers by identifying patches that causally drive feature activation, as opposed to relying solely on activation maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clarifying SAE feature representation in vision transformers is challenging due to the involvement of non-local contexts in self-attention, potentially leading to misinterpretation of activations.

Method: CaFE uses input-attribution methods on Effective Receptive Field (ERF) maps to isolate image patches that causally trigger SAE feature activations, comparing these to naive activation maps.

Result: Experiments demonstrate hidden context dependencies in SAE features and show that CaFE outperforms activation-ranked patches in recovering or suppressing feature activations.

Conclusion: CaFE provides semantically precise and accurate explanations of SAE features, reducing the risk of misinterpreting features based solely on activation locations.

Abstract: Understanding what sparse auto-encoder (SAE) features in vision transformers
truly represent is usually done by inspecting the patches where a feature's
activation is highest. However, self-attention mixes information across the
entire image, so an activated patch often co-occurs with-but does not cause-the
feature's firing. We propose Causal Feature Explanation (CaFE), which leverages
Effective Receptive Field (ERF). We consider each activation of an SAE feature
to be a target and apply input-attribution methods to identify the image
patches that causally drive that activation. Across CLIP-ViT features, ERF maps
frequently diverge from naive activation maps, revealing hidden context
dependencies (e.g., a "roaring face" feature that requires the co-occurrence of
eyes and nose, rather than merely an open mouth). Patch insertion tests confirm
that CaFE more effectively recovers or suppresses feature activations than
activation-ranked patches. Our results show that CaFE yields more faithful and
semantically precise explanations of vision-SAE features, highlighting the risk
of misinterpretation when relying solely on activation location.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-stage retrieval framework for improving event-based image retrieval from free-form captions by integrating dense retrieval, event-aware reranking, and multimodal matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language retrieval models struggle with understanding abstract event semantics, implicit causality, temporal context, and complex narratives in image captions.

Method: The proposed framework combines dense article retrieval using Qwen3, event-aware reranking with Qwen3-Reranker, and image scoring with Qwen2-VL, alongside Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) for robustness.

Result: The system achieved the top-1 score on the private test set of the EVENTA 2025 Grand Challenge (Track 2).

Conclusion: The research demonstrates the potential of integrating language reasoning and multimodal retrieval to tackle complex image understanding tasks, enhancing both retrieval accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Event-based image retrieval from free-form captions presents a significant
challenge: models must understand not only visual features but also latent
event semantics, context, and real-world knowledge. Conventional
vision-language retrieval approaches often fall short when captions describe
abstract events, implicit causality, temporal context, or contain long, complex
narratives. To tackle these issues, we introduce a multi-stage retrieval
framework combining dense article retrieval, event-aware language model
reranking, and efficient image collection, followed by caption-guided semantic
matching and rank-aware selection. We leverage Qwen3 for article search,
Qwen3-Reranker for contextual alignment, and Qwen2-VL for precise image
scoring. To further enhance performance and robustness, we fuse outputs from
multiple configurations using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF). Our system achieves
the top-1 score on the private test set of Track 2 in the EVENTA 2025 Grand
Challenge, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining language-based
reasoning and multimodal retrieval for complex, real-world image understanding.

Motivation: To address the challenges in capturing cross-modal semantics in medical data analysis and improve efficiency and accuracy for ENT endoscopy tasks.

Method: The framework uses CLIP ViT-B/16 backbone enhanced by Low-Rank Adaptation, multi-level CLS token aggregation, and spherical feature interpolation, combined with class-specific natural language prompts and joint training with supervised classification and contrastive learning.

Result: Achieved 95% accuracy and F1-score in classification, Recall@1 of 0.93 (image-to-image retrieval) and 0.92 (text-to-image retrieval), along with high MRR scores of 0.97 and 0.96.

Conclusion: The framework is effective for robust multimodal medical understanding in low-resource settings, validated by strong performance metrics and ablation studies highlighting the contributions of architectural components.

Abstract: We present a unified vision-language framework tailored for ENT endoscopy
image analysis that simultaneously tackles three clinically-relevant tasks:
image classification, image-to-image retrieval, and text-to-image retrieval.
Unlike conventional CNN-based pipelines that struggle to capture cross-modal
semantics, our approach leverages the CLIP ViT-B/16 backbone and enhances it
through Low-Rank Adaptation, multi-level CLS token aggregation, and spherical
feature interpolation. These components collectively enable efficient
fine-tuning on limited medical data while improving representation diversity
and semantic alignment across modalities. To bridge the gap between visual
inputs and textual diagnostic context, we introduce class-specific natural
language prompts that guide the image encoder through a joint training
objective combining supervised classification with contrastive learning. We
validated our framework through participation in the ACM MM'25 ENTRep Grand
Challenge, achieving 95% accuracy and F1-score in classification, Recall@1 of
0.93 and 0.92 for image-to-image and text-to-image retrieval respectively, and
MRR scores of 0.97 and 0.96. Ablation studies demonstrated the incremental
benefits of each architectural component, validating the effectiveness of our
design for robust multimodal medical understanding in low-resource clinical
settings.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel watermarking framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting models that bypasses traditional computationally expensive methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing popularity of 3DGS models necessitates an efficient and generalizable copyright protection method to ensure secure use and ownership.

Method: A forward-pass-based watermarking framework, called GaussianBridge, that converts 3D Gaussian models into Splatter Images. It includes visual-quality heatmap predictions for imperceptibility and dense segmentation mechanisms for robust extraction.

Result: An efficient and imperceptible watermarking approach that reliably extracts embedded messages in 3DGS models, even under extreme conditions such as minimal rendering regions.

Conclusion: GaussianBridge establishes a pioneering and efficient solution for 3DGS watermarking, offering optimal balance between imperceptibility and robustness.

Abstract: The growing popularity of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has intensified the
need for effective copyright protection. Current 3DGS watermarking methods rely
on computationally expensive fine-tuning procedures for each predefined
message. We propose the first generalizable watermarking framework that enables
efficient protection of Splatter Image-based 3DGS models through a single
forward pass. We introduce GaussianBridge that transforms unstructured 3D
Gaussians into Splatter Image format, enabling direct neural processing for
arbitrary message embedding. To ensure imperceptibility, we design a
Gaussian-Uncertainty-Perceptual heatmap prediction strategy for preserving
visual quality. For robust message recovery, we develop a dense
segmentation-based extraction mechanism that maintains reliable extraction even
when watermarked objects occupy minimal regions in rendered views. Project

*Bin Yang,Yulin Zhang,Hong-Yu Zhou,Sibei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces novel solutions to the 'Toxic Siblings' bias problem in human-object interaction detection transformers, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the performance of human-object interaction detection systems by addressing the 'Toxic Siblings' bias, which negatively impacts triplet recognition due to high similarity among sibling triplets.

Method: The authors propose two solutions: 'contrastive-then-calibration,' which reconstructs sibling-like incorrect triplets using positional priors, and 'merge-then-split,' which learns shared features for group differentiation before refining intra-group uniqueness.

Result: The proposed methods improve the baseline significantly (+9.18% mAP) and outperform the state-of-the-art (+3.59% mAP) on the HICO-Det dataset.

Conclusion: The study successfully mitigates the 'Toxic Siblings' bias, improving both localization and recognition of human-action-object triplets in images.

Abstract: Detection transformers have been applied to human-object interaction (HOI)
detection, enhancing the localization and recognition of human-action-object
triplets in images. Despite remarkable progress, this study identifies a
critical issue-"Toxic Siblings" bias-which hinders the interaction decoder's
learning, as numerous similar yet distinct HOI triplets interfere with and even
compete against each other both input side and output side to the interaction
decoder. This bias arises from high confusion among sibling
triplets/categories, where increased similarity paradoxically reduces
precision, as one's gain comes at the expense of its toxic sibling's decline.
To address this, we propose two novel debiasing learning
objectives-"contrastive-then-calibration" and "merge-then-split"-targeting the
input and output perspectives, respectively. The former samples sibling-like
incorrect HOI triplets and reconstructs them into correct ones, guided by
strong positional priors. The latter first learns shared features among sibling
categories to distinguish them from other groups, then explicitly refines
intra-group differentiation to preserve uniqueness. Experiments show that we
significantly outperform both the baseline (+9.18% mAP on HICO-Det) and the
state-of-the-art (+3.59% mAP) across various settings.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a dataset called InterPose, comprising 73.8K human-object interaction sequences extracted from 45.8K videos, to advance human-motion generation in complex scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current motion generation systems focus primarily on isolated individuals in empty spaces, neglecting realistic human-object interactions due to a lack of diverse and large-scale datasets.

Method: The authors developed an automatic motion extraction pipeline to collect interaction-rich human motions from videos, creating a dataset with textual descriptions and 3D sequences of diverse human-object interactions.

Result: Using the InterPose dataset, state-of-the-art human motion generation methods achieved significant improvements, and an LLM-based agent was developed for zero-shot animation involving human-object interactions.

Conclusion: InterPose is a crucial step forward in synthesizing human motion in realistic settings, providing a foundation for better model performance and innovation in human-object interaction tasks.

Abstract: Human motion generation has shown great advances thanks to the recent
diffusion models trained on large-scale motion capture data. Most of existing
works, however, currently target animation of isolated people in empty scenes.
Meanwhile, synthesizing realistic human-object interactions in complex 3D
scenes remains a critical challenge in computer graphics and robotics. One
obstacle towards generating versatile high-fidelity human-object interactions
is the lack of large-scale datasets with diverse object manipulations. Indeed,
existing motion capture data is typically restricted to single people and
manipulations of limited sets of objects. To address this issue, we propose an
automatic motion extraction pipeline and use it to collect interaction-rich
human motions. Our new dataset InterPose contains 73.8K sequences of 3D human
motions and corresponding text captions automatically obtained from 45.8K
videos with human-object interactions. We perform extensive experiments and
demonstrate InterPose to bring significant improvements to state-of-the-art
methods for human motion generation. Moreover, using InterPose we develop an
LLM-based agent enabling zero-shot animation of people interacting with diverse
objects and scenes.

*Haomiao Tang,Wenjie Li,Yixiang Qiu,Genping Wang,Shu-Tao Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper develops 'Cancelable Product Quantization,' addressing privacy concerns in secure face retrieval systems using a hierarchical two-stage framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face retrieval systems often rely on third-party services, raising privacy risks. Current encryption methods like homomorphic encryption are too slow for practical use.

Method: The authors propose a two-stage framework: 1) A cancelable indexing module for fast filtering, 2) A cipher-space retrieval module for precise ranking, with tailored protection mechanisms for secure authentication.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets confirm that the proposed method is effective, efficient, and secure in balancing face retrieval system requirements.

Conclusion: This paper provides a viable solution to enhance portrait privacy in face retrieval systems by integrating speed, security, and accuracy using an innovative hierarchical approach.

Abstract: Despite the ubiquity of modern face retrieval systems, their retrieval stage
is often outsourced to third-party entities, posing significant risks to user
portrait privacy. Although homomorphic encryption (HE) offers strong security
guarantees by enabling arithmetic computations in the cipher space, its high
computational inefficiency makes it unsuitable for real-time, real-world
applications. To address this issue, we propose Cancelable Product
Quantization, a highly efficient framework for secure face representation
retrieval. Our hierarchical two-stage framework comprises: (i) a
high-throughput cancelable PQ indexing module for fast candidate filtering, and
(ii) a fine-grained cipher-space retrieval module for final precise face
ranking. A tailored protection mechanism is designed to secure the indexing
module for cancelable biometric authentication while ensuring efficiency.
Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves an
decent balance between effectiveness, efficiency and security.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve line segment detection by balancing precision and completeness while avoiding complex refinements.

Method: It uses a hierarchical approach involving regular anchors and aligned anchor groups, linking these to form line segments, and applying straightforward validation and merging.

Result: Experiments across datasets show that AAGLSD outperforms other advanced detectors in extracting complete line segments.

Conclusion: AAGLSD provides an effective solution for precise and complete line segment detection with simplified processing, enhanced performance, and open-source availability.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel line segment detector, the Aligned Anchor
Groups guided Line Segment Detector (AAGLSD), designed to detect line segments
from images with high precision and completeness. The algorithm employs a
hierarchical approach to extract candidate pixels with different saliency
levels, including regular anchors and aligned anchor groups. AAGLSD initiates
from these aligned anchor groups, sequentially linking anchors and updating the
currently predicted line segment simultaneously. The final predictions are
derived through straightforward validation and merging of adjacent line
segments, avoiding complex refinement strategies. AAGLSD is evaluated on
various datasets and quantitative experiments demonstrate that the proposed
method can effectively extract complete line segments from input images
compared to other advanced line segment detectors. The implementation is
available at https://github.com/LLiDaBao/AAGLSD.

*Ganxi Xu,Jinyi Long,Jia Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel image-to-brain framework combining DDPMs with cross-attention mechanisms to improve the generation of biologically plausible brain signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for generating brain signals for visual prostheses lack biological similarity and supervised validation signals from real brain responses.

Method: The proposed framework leverages a pre-trained CLIP visual encoder for extracting semantic representations and integrates a cross-attention enhanced U-Net diffusion model for iterative denoising to reconstruct biologically plausible brain signals.

Result: The approach is evaluated using two multimodal datasets (THINGS-EEG and THINGS-MEG), showing effectiveness and visualizing intra- and inter-subject brain signal variations.

Conclusion: The novel framework demonstrates its potential to address critical limitations in brain encoding for visual prostheses, advancing biological plausibility in brain signal generation.

Abstract: Visual prostheses have shown great potential in restoring vision for blind
individuals. On the one hand, researchers have been continuously improving the
brain decoding framework of visual prostheses by leveraging the powerful image
generation capabilities of diffusion models. On the other hand, the brain
encoding stage of visual prostheses struggles to generate brain signals with
sufficient biological similarity. Although existing works have recognized this
problem, the quality of predicted stimuli still remains a critical issue, as
existing approaches typically lack supervised signals from real brain responses
to validate the biological plausibility of predicted stimuli. To address this
issue, we propose a novel image-to-brain framework based on denoising diffusion
probabilistic models (DDPMs) enhanced with cross-attention mechanisms. Our
framework consists of two key architectural components: a pre-trained CLIP
visual encoder that extracts rich semantic representations from input images,
and a cross-attention enhanced U-Net diffusion model that learns to reconstruct
biologically plausible brain signals through iterative denoising. Unlike
conventional generative models that rely on simple concatenation for
conditioning, our cross-attention modules enable dynamic interaction between
visual features and brain signal representations, facilitating fine-grained
alignment during the generation process. We evaluate our framework on two
multimodal datasets (THINGS-EEG2 and THINGS-MEG) to demonstrate its
effectiveness in generating biologically plausible brain signals. Moreover, we
visualize the training and test M/EEG topographies for all subjects on both
datasets to intuitively demonstrate the intra-subject variations and
inter-subject variations in M/EEG signals.

*Pei Liu,Qingtian Ning,Xinyan Lu,Haipeng Liu,Weiliang Ma,Dangen She,Peng Jia,Xianpeng Lang,Jun Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents the OmniReason framework, which enhances vision-language models for autonomous driving through improved spatiotemporal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models focus on static scene understanding, neglecting the critical temporal dimension needed for real-world driving scenarios.

Method: The framework includes OmniReason-Data, a large-scale dataset with dense spatiotemporal annotations, and OmniReason-Agent, an architecture leveraging temporal memory and explanation generation.

Result: Comprehensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance in open-loop planning and visual question answering, as well as enhanced interpretability for temporally-aware autonomous vehicles.

Conclusion: OmniReason establishes robust spatiotemporal reasoning and improves decision-making capabilities for autonomous vehicles in dynamic 3D environments.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive
spatial reasoning capabilities for autonomous driving, yet existing methods
predominantly focus on static scene understanding while neglecting the
essential temporal dimension of real-world driving scenarios. To address this
critical limitation, we propose the OmniReason framework, which establishes
robust spatiotemporal reasoning by jointly modeling dynamic 3D environments and
their underlying decision-making processes. Our work makes two fundamental
advances: (1) We introduce OmniReason-Data, two large-scale
vision-language-action (VLA) datasets with dense spatiotemporal annotations and
natural language explanations, generated through a novel
hallucination-mitigated auto-labeling pipeline that ensures both physical
plausibility and temporal coherence; (2) We develop the OmniReason-Agent
architecture, which integrates a sparse temporal memory module for persistent
scene context modeling and an explanation generator that produces
human-interpretable decision rationales, facilitated by our spatiotemporal
knowledge distillation approach that effectively captures spatiotemporal causal
reasoning patterns. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance, where OmniReason-Agent achieves significant improvements in both
open-loop planning tasks and visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks, while
establishing new capabilities for interpretable, temporally-aware autonomous
vehicles operating in complex, dynamic environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MI-RAG is a novel framework for multimodal iterative retrieval in knowledge-intensive VQA, achieving better answer accuracy through iterative reasoning and retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on visual questions requiring external knowledge, and the inefficiencies of single-pass Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

Method: Introduces MI-RAG, which iteratively refines reasoning and retrieval using a multi-query system, synthesizing knowledge from visual and textual sources into a reasoning record to improve understanding.

Result: Achieved significant improvements in retrieval recall and answer accuracy on challenging benchmarks such as Encyclopedic VQA, InfoSeek, and OK-VQA.

Conclusion: MI-RAG offers a scalable solution for compositional reasoning in multimodal, knowledge-intensive VQA tasks by integrating iterative reasoning and retrieval mechanisms.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced
multimodal understanding, their performance remains limited on
knowledge-intensive visual questions that require external knowledge beyond the
image. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a promising solution for
providing models with external knowledge, its conventional single-pass
framework often fails to gather sufficient knowledge. To overcome this
limitation, we propose MI-RAG, a Multimodal Iterative RAG framework that
leverages reasoning to enhance retrieval and update reasoning over newly
retrieved knowledge across modalities. At each iteration, MI-RAG leverages an
accumulated reasoning record to dynamically formulate a multi-query. These
queries then drive a joint search across heterogeneous knowledge bases
containing both visually-grounded and textual knowledge. The newly acquired
knowledge is synthesized into the reasoning record, progressively refining
understanding across iterations. Experiments on challenging benchmarks,
including Encyclopedic VQA, InfoSeek, and OK-VQA, show that MI-RAG
significantly improves both retrieval recall and answer accuracy, establishing
a scalable approach for compositional reasoning in knowledge-intensive VQA.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework that combines AI and semantic guidance for improved 3D reconstruction in underwater scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater environments pose challenges for 3D reconstruction due to light distortion, turbidity, and limited visibility. Existing methods underutilize the potential of AI, particularly the integration of language models with visual processing.

Method: The proposed method uses multimodal cross-knowledge to integrate semantic features into 3D Gaussian Splatting for deep-sea scene reconstruction. It employs CLIP-based semantic supervision, semantic consistency loss, and a stage-wise training strategy combining coarse-to-fine learning and late-stage refinement.

Result: The approach outperforms existing methods on SeaThru-NeRF and Submerged3D datasets across three metrics, achieving up to 3.09 dB average improvement in PSNR.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates robustness, high fidelity, and enhanced scene understanding, positioning it as a strong candidate for underwater exploration and marine perception applications.

Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction in underwater environments remains a complex
challenge due to issues such as light distortion, turbidity, and limited
visibility. AI-based techniques have been applied to address these issues,
however, existing methods have yet to fully exploit the potential of AI,
particularly in integrating language models with visual processing. In this
paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages multimodal cross-knowledge
to create semantic-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting for robust and high-fidelity
deep-sea scene reconstruction. By embedding an extra semantic feature into each
Gaussian primitive and supervised by the CLIP extracted semantic feature, our
method enforces semantic and structural awareness throughout the training. The
dedicated semantic consistency loss ensures alignment with high-level scene
understanding. Besides, we propose a novel stage-wise training strategy,
combining coarse-to-fine learning with late-stage parameter refinement, to
further enhance both stability and reconstruction quality. Extensive results
show that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on
SeaThru-NeRF and Submerged3D datasets across three metrics, with an improvement
of up to 3.09 dB on average in terms of PSNR, making it a strong candidate for
applications in underwater exploration and marine perception.

*Yang Chen,Sanglin Zhao,Baoyu Chen,Mans Gustaf*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an adaptive contrast adjustment module (ACAM) to enhance fetal ultrasound standard plane classification, improving performance across diverse models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in fetal ultrasound classification stemming from low tissue contrast, boundary ambiguity, and operator-dependent image quality variations.

Method: A shallow texture-sensitive network predicts contrast parameters to create contrast-enhanced views, which are fused in downstream classifiers, improving robustness and accuracy.

Result: ACAM consistently improves classification accuracy on a multi-center dataset, with increases of 2.02%, 1.29%, and 1.15% for lightweight, traditional, and state-of-the-art models respectively.

Conclusion: The proposed module bridges low-level image features with high-level semantics, aligning with sonographer workflows and improving robustness to imaging variations, setting a new standard for medical image analysis.

Abstract: Fetal ultrasound standard plane classification is essential for reliable
prenatal diagnosis but faces inherent challenges, including low tissue
contrast, boundary ambiguity, and operator-dependent image quality variations.
To overcome these limitations, we propose a plug-and-play adaptive contrast
adjustment module (ACAM), whose core design is inspired by the clinical
practice of doctors adjusting image contrast to obtain clearer and more
discriminative structural information. The module employs a shallow
texture-sensitive network to predict clinically plausible contrast parameters,
transforms input images into multiple contrast-enhanced views through
differentiable mapping, and fuses them within downstream classifiers. Validated
on a multi-center dataset of 12,400 images across six anatomical categories,
the module consistently improves performance across diverse models, with
accuracy of lightweight models increasing by 2.02 percent, accuracy of
traditional models increasing by 1.29 percent, and accuracy of state-of-the-art
models increasing by 1.15 percent. The innovation of the module lies in its
content-aware adaptation capability, replacing random preprocessing with
physics-informed transformations that align with sonographer workflows while
improving robustness to imaging heterogeneity through multi-view fusion. This
approach effectively bridges low-level image features with high-level
semantics, establishing a new paradigm for medical image analysis under
real-world image quality variations.

*Xinlei Liu,Tao Hu,Peng Yi,Weitao Han,Jichao Xie,Baolin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Sequential Difference Maximization (SDM), a novel adversarial attack method aimed at assessing the robustness of vision models, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve adversarial attack methods for better evaluation of computer vision model robustness, addressing limitations in performance and cost-effectiveness of existing approaches.

Method: The proposed SDM method redefines the objective of generating adversarial examples and uses a three-layer optimization framework (cycle-stage-step) with different loss functions tailored to the specific stages of the attacks.

Result: Experiments show that SDM surpasses state-of-the-art methods in attack performance and cost-effectiveness. Additionally, it enhances the efficiency of adversarial training methods when applied.

Conclusion: SDM provides a stronger and more cost-effective adversarial attack method that benefits both robustness evaluation and defense enhancement in vision models.

Abstract: Efficient adversarial attack methods are critical for assessing the
robustness of computer vision models. In this paper, we reconstruct the
optimization objective for generating adversarial examples as "maximizing the
difference between the non-true labels' probability upper bound and the true
label's probability," and propose a gradient-based attack method termed
Sequential Difference Maximization (SDM). SDM establishes a three-layer
optimization framework of "cycle-stage-step." The processes between cycles and
between iterative steps are respectively identical, while optimization stages
differ in terms of loss functions: in the initial stage, the negative
probability of the true label is used as the loss function to compress the
solution space; in subsequent stages, we introduce the Directional Probability
Difference Ratio (DPDR) loss function to gradually increase the non-true
labels' probability upper bound by compressing the irrelevant labels'
probabilities. Experiments demonstrate that compared with previous SOTA
methods, SDM not only exhibits stronger attack performance but also achieves
higher attack cost-effectiveness. Additionally, SDM can be combined with
adversarial training methods to enhance their defensive effects. The code is
available at https://github.com/X-L-Liu/SDM.

*Jongwook Si,Sungyoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents an advanced method for detecting surface texture defects by integrating Gabor filters with a hybrid U-Net-ViT model, achieving high accuracy across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve accuracy and reliability in texture-based surface defect detection, especially in noisy environments.

Method: Combines local feature training (U-Net) with global processing (ViT), employs Gaussian filter-based loss, Salt-and-Pepper masking, and incorporates Gabor filters for post-processing along with parameter optimization.

Result: The model achieved an average AUC of 0.939 across datasets such as MVTec-AD and others, confirming its efficacy.

Conclusion: The approach effectively combines filters and hybrid modeling techniques, demonstrating robust defect detection and generalization across diverse surface textures.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to enhance the accuracy and reliability
of texture-based surface defect detection using Gabor filters and a blurring
U-Net-ViT model. By combining the local feature training of U-Net with the
global processing of the Vision Transformer(ViT), the model effectively detects
defects across various textures. A Gaussian filter-based loss function removes
background noise and highlights defect patterns, while Salt-and-Pepper(SP)
masking in the training process reinforces texture-defect boundaries, ensuring
robust performance in noisy environments. Gabor filters are applied in
post-processing to emphasize defect orientation and frequency characteristics.
Parameter optimization, including filter size, sigma, wavelength, gamma, and
orientation, maximizes performance across datasets like MVTec-AD, Surface Crack
Detection, and Marble Surface Anomaly Dataset, achieving an average Area Under
the Curve(AUC) of 0.939. The ablation studies validate that the optimal filter
size and noise probability significantly enhance defect detection performance.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified optimization framework to address pose estimation errors in dynamic 3D scene reconstruction from monocular videos affected by motion blur, improving reconstruction quality and pose accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular video, which is often hindered by degradation in camera pose estimation due to motion blur.

Method: The paper introduces a unified optimization framework integrating camera poses as learnable parameters alongside 3D Gaussian attributes, employing a three-stage training schedule to alternately optimize poses and Gaussians for stable end-to-end optimization.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates significant improvements in reconstruction quality and pose estimation accuracy compared to prior techniques, validated through experiments on the Stereo Blur dataset and real-world sequences.

Conclusion: By leveraging the unified optimization of camera poses and 3D Gaussian attributes, the paper offers a robust solution for reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes impacted by motion blur, promising advancements in AR/VR, robotics, and autonomous navigation applications.

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular video has broad applications
in AR/VR, robotics, and autonomous navigation, but often fails due to severe
motion blur caused by camera and object motion. Existing methods commonly
follow a two-step pipeline, where camera poses are first estimated and then 3D
Gaussians are optimized. Since blurring artifacts usually undermine pose
estimation, pose errors could be accumulated to produce inferior reconstruction
results. To address this issue, we introduce a unified optimization framework
by incorporating camera poses as learnable parameters complementary to 3DGS
attributes for end-to-end optimization. Specifically, we recast camera and
object motion as per-primitive SE(3) affine transformations on 3D Gaussians and
formulate a unified optimization objective. For stable optimization, we
introduce a three-stage training schedule that optimizes camera poses and
Gaussians alternatively. Particularly, 3D Gaussians are first trained with
poses being fixed, and then poses are optimized with 3D Gaussians being
untouched. Finally, all learnable parameters are optimized together. Extensive
experiments on the Stereo Blur dataset and challenging real-world sequences
demonstrate that our method achieves significant gains in reconstruction
quality and pose estimation accuracy over prior dynamic deblurring methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to optimize segmentation performance using self-supervised vision models without increasing computational and parameter overhead.

Method: The authors use a frozen DINOv3 backbone with multi-level feature extraction, alignment to common resolution and channel width, and a lightweight MLP decoder to predict masks.

Result: SegDINO achieves state-of-the-art performance on six benchmarks, improving efficiency and accuracy in both medical and natural image datasets.

Conclusion: SegDINO validates the representational power of DINO features for efficient segmentation and performs better than existing, more complex models.

Abstract: The DINO family of self-supervised vision models has shown remarkable
transferability, yet effectively adapting their representations for
segmentation remains challenging. Existing approaches often rely on heavy
decoders with multi-scale fusion or complex upsampling, which introduce
substantial parameter overhead and computational cost. In this work, we propose
SegDINO, an efficient segmentation framework that couples a frozen DINOv3
backbone with a lightweight decoder. SegDINO extracts multi-level features from
the pretrained encoder, aligns them to a common resolution and channel width,
and utilizes a lightweight MLP head to directly predict segmentation masks.
This design minimizes trainable parameters while preserving the
representational power of foundation features. Extensive experiments across six
benchmarks, including three medical datasets (TN3K, Kvasir-SEG, ISIC) and three
natural image datasets (MSD, VMD-D, ViSha), demonstrate that SegDINO
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing
methods. Code is available at https://github.com/script-Yang/SegDINO.

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel hybrid dehazing framework, SUFERNOBWA, combining Swin Transformer and U-Net to enhance satellite image clarity and structural integrity under various atmospheric conditions. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art models on critical datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Atmospheric interference and haze significantly compromise the clarity of satellite imagery, impacting the accuracy of information extraction across fields like remote sensing and geospatial analysis.

Method: The SUFERNOBWA framework integrates Swin Transformer-based Residual-in-Residual Dense Blocks within encoder and decoder structures, allowing for robust global and local feature extraction.

Result: The method achieved state-of-the-art results, with a PSNR of 33.24 dB and an SSIM of 0.967 on the RICE dataset, significantly outperforming existing techniques. Similar superior performance was observed on the SateHaze1K dataset.

Conclusion: This study offers an effective, robust solution for reducing atmospheric interference in satellite images, with broad applicability in remote sensing and related fields.

Abstract: Satellite imagery plays a crucial role in various fields; however,
atmospheric interference and haze significantly degrade image clarity and
reduce the accuracy of information extraction. To address these challenges,
this paper proposes a hybrid dehazing framework that integrates Swin
Transformer and U-Net to balance global context learning and local detail
restoration, called SUFERNOBWA. The proposed network employs SwinRRDB, a Swin
Transformer-based Residual-in-Residual Dense Block, in both the encoder and
decoder to effectively extract features. This module enables the joint learning
of global contextual information and fine spatial structures, which is crucial
for structural preservation in satellite image. Furthermore, we introduce a
composite loss function that combines L2 loss, guided loss, and a novel
watershed loss, which enhances structural boundary preservation and ensures
pixel-level accuracy. This architecture enables robust dehazing under diverse
atmospheric conditions while maintaining structural consistency across restored
images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art models on both the RICE and SateHaze1K datasets. Specifically,
on the RICE dataset, the proposed approach achieved a PSNR of 33.24 dB and an
SSIM of 0.967, which is a significant improvement over existing method. This
study provides an effective solution for mitigating atmospheric interference in
satellite imagery and highlights its potential applicability across diverse
remote sensing applications.

### [313] [Look Beyond: Two-Stage Scene View Generation via Panorama and Video Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00843)
*Xueyang Kang,Zhengkang Xiang,Zezheng Zhang,Kourosh Khoshelham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel approach for single-image novel view synthesis (NVS) that achieves long-term view consistency by combining panorama generation and keyframe-based interpolation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for NVS often fail to maintain coherence and alignment over extended viewing trajectories or loop closures, especially for unobserved large scene areas.

Method: The approach decomposes the NVS task into two stages: (1) a panorama diffusion model generates a 360-degree scene extrapolation from a single input image, and (2) keyframes are sampled and warped from this panorama to guide a pre-trained video diffusion model, which synthesizes new views via spatial noise diffusion.

Result: The proposed method outperforms prior approaches on diverse datasets, achieving globally consistent new views even in challenging loop closures and enabling user-defined camera control.

Conclusion: The authors' approach enhances the coherence and alignment of generated views over extended trajectories, offering significant improvements for single-image NVS applications.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) from a single image is highly ill-posed due to
large unobserved regions, especially for views that deviate significantly from
the input. While existing methods focus on consistency between the source and
generated views, they often fail to maintain coherence and correct view
alignment across long-range or looped trajectories. We propose a model that
addresses this by decomposing single-view NVS into a 360-degree scene
extrapolation followed by novel view interpolation. This design ensures
long-term view and scene consistency by conditioning on keyframes extracted and
warped from a generated panoramic representation. In the first stage, a
panorama diffusion model learns the scene prior from the input perspective
image. Perspective keyframes are then sampled and warped from the panorama and
used as anchor frames in a pre-trained video diffusion model, which generates
novel views through a proposed spatial noise diffusion process. Compared to
prior work, our method produces globally consistent novel views -- even in loop
closure scenarios -- while enabling flexible camera control. Experiments on
diverse scene datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing
methods in generating coherent views along user-defined trajectories. Our
implementation is available at https://github.com/YiGuYT/LookBeyond.

*Jiacheng Jiang,Yuan Meng,Chen Tang,Han Yu,Qun Li,Zhi Wang,Wenwu Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies out-of-distribution (OOD) performance degradation issues in quantization-aware training (QAT) and proposes the FQAT method to address these issues by focusing on loss landscape flatness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most current QAT methods aim only at maximizing performance on in-distribution (I.D.) data, neglecting performance on OOD data. The study highlights this oversight and investigates why QAT can reduce OOD generalization capabilities.

Method: The proposed FQAT introduces two mechanisms: 1) a layer-wise freezing approach to manage optimization conflicts and 2) an adaptive freezing algorithm using a gradient disorder metric to handle unstable layers. These strategies ensure smoother loss landscapes and reduce interference between layers.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that FQAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution image classification benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness.

Conclusion: FQAT effectively mitigates the OOD performance degradation in QAT by targeting loss landscape flatness, offering a generalizable solution that enhances both I.D. and OOD classification performance.

Abstract: Current quantization-aware training (QAT) methods primarily focus on
enhancing the performance of quantized models on in-distribution (I.D) data,
while overlooking the potential performance degradation on out-of-distribution
(OOD) data. In this paper, we first substantiate this problem through rigorous
experiment, showing that QAT can lead to a significant OOD generalization
performance degradation. Further, we find the contradiction between the
perspective that flatness of loss landscape gives rise to superior OOD
generalization and the phenomenon that QAT lead to a sharp loss landscape, can
cause the above problem. Therefore, we propose a flatness-oriented QAT method,
FQAT, to achieve generalizable QAT. Specifically, i) FQAT introduces a
layer-wise freezing mechanism to mitigate the gradient conflict issue between
dual optimization objectives (i.e., vanilla QAT and flatness). ii) FQAT

### [315] [Pose as Clinical Prior: Learning Dual Representations for Scoliosis Screening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00872)
*Zirui Zhou,Zizhao Peng,Dongyang Jin,Chao Fan,Fengwei An,Shiqi Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Scoliosis1K-Pose, a 2D human pose dataset, and the Dual Representation Framework (DRF) for scoliosis screening, achieving state-of-the-art performance in identifying postural asymmetries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI-based scoliosis screening methods rely heavily on silhouette datasets and overlook clinically relevant postural asymmetries. The paper aims to leverage pose data due to its intuitive skeletal representation and clinical interpretability while tackling the lack of annotated pose datasets and sensitivity of raw pose coordinates.

Method: The authors created the Scoliosis1K-Pose dataset, adding 2D pose annotations to the Scoliosis1K dataset. They developed the DRF framework, integrating a continuous skeleton map and a discrete Postural Asymmetry Vector (PAV). The PAV-Guided Attention (PGA) module was designed to extract clinically meaningful features based on asymmetry cues.

Result: The proposed DRF method demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in scoliosis screening. Visualizations showed the model effectively extracted asymmetry-related features by leveraging clinical cues.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of combining clinically informed pose data with advanced modeling to improve scoliosis screening. The publicly available dataset and code enhance research reproducibility and usability for future work.

Abstract: Recent AI-based scoliosis screening methods primarily rely on large-scale
silhouette datasets, often neglecting clinically relevant postural
asymmetries-key indicators in traditional screening. In contrast, pose data
provide an intuitive skeletal representation, enhancing clinical
interpretability across various medical applications. However, pose-based
scoliosis screening remains underexplored due to two main challenges: (1) the
scarcity of large-scale, annotated pose datasets; and (2) the discrete and
noise-sensitive nature of raw pose coordinates, which hinders the modeling of
subtle asymmetries. To address these limitations, we introduce
Scoliosis1K-Pose, a 2D human pose annotation set that extends the original
Scoliosis1K dataset, comprising 447,900 frames of 2D keypoints from 1,050
adolescents. Building on this dataset, we introduce the Dual Representation
Framework (DRF), which integrates a continuous skeleton map to preserve spatial
structure with a discrete Postural Asymmetry Vector (PAV) that encodes
clinically relevant asymmetry descriptors. A novel PAV-Guided Attention (PGA)
module further uses the PAV as clinical prior to direct feature extraction from
the skeleton map, focusing on clinically meaningful asymmetries. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that DRF achieves state-of-the-art performance.
Visualizations further confirm that the model leverages clinical asymmetry cues
to guide feature extraction and promote synergy between its dual
representations. The dataset and code are publicly available at

### [316] [Spotlighter: Revisiting Prompt Tuning from a Representative Mining View](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00905)
*Yutong Gao,Maoyuan Shao,Xinyang Huang,Chuang Zhu,Lijuan Sun,Yu Weng,Xuan Liu,Guoshun Nan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Spotlighter, a framework to enhance prompt tuning in CLIP by reducing noise and boosting token selection efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt tuning in CLIP faces challenges from redundant or irrelevant visual token features, leading to noise and unnecessary computational costs.

Method: Spotlighter evaluates a visual token's activation from sample-wise and semantic-wise views, retains high-scoring tokens, uses prototypes from a class-specific semantic memory bank, and ranks token-prototype interactions dynamically.

Result: Spotlighter surpasses CLIP in accuracy by up to 11.19% and increases FPS by 0.8K across benchmarks, utilizing only 21 additional parameters.

Conclusion: Spotlighter is a scalable, effective baseline for prompt tuning, demonstrating improved accuracy and efficiency in cross-modal semantic alignment.

Abstract: CLIP's success has demonstrated that prompt tuning can achieve robust
cross-modal semantic alignment for tasks ranging from open-domain recognition
to fine-grained classification. However, redundant or weakly relevant feature
components introduce noise and incur unnecessary computational costs. In this
work, we propose Spotlighter, a lightweight token-selection framework that
simultaneously enhances accuracy and efficiency in prompt tuning. Spotlighter
evaluates each visual token's activation from both sample-wise and
semantic-wise perspectives and retains only the top-scoring tokens for
downstream prediction. A class-specific semantic memory bank of learned
prototypes refines this selection, ensuring semantic representativeness and
compensating for discarded features. To further prioritize informative signals,
we introduce a two-level ranking mechanism that dynamically weights
token--prototype interactions. Across 11 few-shot benchmarks, Spotlighter
outperforms CLIP by up to 11.19\% in harmonic mean accuracy and achieves up to
0.8K additional FPS, with only 21 extra parameters. These results establish
Spotlighter as an effective and scalable baseline for prompt tuning. Code for
our method will be available at

### [317] [IPG: Incremental Patch Generation for Generalized Adversarial Patch Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10946)
*Wonho Lee,Hyunsik Na,Jisu Lee,Daeseon Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Incremental Patch Generation (IPG), a method for efficiently creating adversarial patches for testing AI model vulnerabilities. IPG is highly effective, producing patches 11.1 times faster than prior approaches while preserving attack performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency and generalization of adversarial patches, which reveal vulnerabilities in AI models, to enhance robustness in critical applications such as autonomous vehicles and security systems.

Method: The paper proposes Incremental Patch Generation (IPG), a method for generating adversarial patches efficiently, backed by experimental tests and ablation studies like feature distribution visualization and adversarial training.

Result: IPG produces adversarial patches significantly faster than traditional methods (11.1 times), with comparable attack efficacy. It also creates generalized patches covering broader vulnerabilities in AI models.

Conclusion: IPG presents significant potential for strengthening AI security in dynamic and high-risk environments, serving as a foundation for improving adversarial patch defense and crafting more resilient AI systems.

Abstract: The advent of adversarial patches poses a significant challenge to the
robustness of AI models, particularly in the domain of computer vision tasks
such as object detection. In contradistinction to traditional adversarial
examples, these patches target specific regions of an image, resulting in the
malfunction of AI models. This paper proposes Incremental Patch Generation
(IPG), a method that generates adversarial patches up to 11.1 times more
efficiently than existing approaches while maintaining comparable attack
performance. The efficacy of IPG is demonstrated by experiments and ablation
studies including YOLO's feature distribution visualization and adversarial
training results, which show that it produces well-generalized patches that
effectively cover a broader range of model vulnerabilities. Furthermore,
IPG-generated datasets can serve as a robust knowledge foundation for
constructing a robust model, enabling structured representation, advanced
reasoning, and proactive defenses in AI security ecosystems. The findings of
this study suggest that IPG has considerable potential for future utilization
not only in adversarial patch defense but also in real-world applications such
as autonomous vehicles, security systems, and medical imaging, where AI models
must remain resilient to adversarial attacks in dynamic and high-stakes
environments.

### [318] [DarkVRAI: Capture-Condition Conditioning and Burst-Order Selective Scan for Low-light RAW Video Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00917)
*Youngjin Oh,Junhyeong Kwon,Junyoung Park,Nam Ik Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'DarkVRAI,' a new framework achieving top results in low-light RAW video denoising, leveraging metadata-based conditioning and a mechanism for modeling temporal dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-light RAW video denoising is highly challenging due to sensor noise, high gain, and short exposure times required for video frame rates.

Method: The method incorporates a conditioning scheme using metadata for alignment and denoising, and the Burst-Order Selective Scan (BOSS) mechanism to model temporal dependencies.

Result: DarkVRAI achieved first place in the AIM 2025 Low-light RAW Video Denoising Challenge and set a new benchmark in performance.

Conclusion: By combining innovative conditioning and temporal modeling techniques, DarkVRAI advances the state-of-the-art for low-light video denoising.

Abstract: Low-light RAW video denoising is a fundamentally challenging task due to
severe signal degradation caused by high sensor gain and short exposure times,
which are inherently limited by video frame rate requirements. To address this,
we propose DarkVRAI, a novel framework that achieved first place in the AIM
2025 Low-light RAW Video Denoising Challenge. Our method introduces two primary
contributions: (1) a successful application of a conditioning scheme for image
denoising, which explicitly leverages capture metadata, to video denoising to
guide the alignment and denoising processes, and (2) a Burst-Order Selective
Scan (BOSS) mechanism that effectively models long-range temporal dependencies
within the noisy video sequence. By synergistically combining these components,
DarkVRAI demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on a rigorous and realistic
benchmark dataset, setting a new standard for low-light video denoising.

### [319] [Seeing More, Saying More: Lightweight Language Experts are Dynamic Video Token Compressors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00969)
*Xiangchen Wang,Jinrui Zhang,Teng Wang,Haigang Zhang,Feng Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes LangDC, a language-aware dynamic token compression strategy to improve efficiency in video-language models, reducing computational costs while retaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome inefficiencies in current token compression methods for video-language models, which use fixed compression ratios and fail to adapt to the varying semantic density of video clips.

Method: LangDC uses a lightweight language model to generate soft caption tokens as visual representations and dynamically adjusts compression ratios based on scene richness, guided by semantic density-aware supervision.

Result: The approach demonstrates a 49% reduction in FLOPs compared to VideoGPT+ while maintaining competitive task performance, and it adaptively compresses tokens based on video segment complexity.

Conclusion: LangDC effectively optimizes token usage by dynamically adapting compression ratios to scene richness, balancing computational efficiency with robust information representation.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large video-language models have revolutionized video
understanding tasks. However, their efficiency is significantly constrained by
processing high volumes of visual tokens. Existing token compression strategies
apply a fixed compression ratio, ignoring the variability in semantic density
among different video clips. Consequently, this lead to inadequate
representation of information-rich clips due to insufficient tokens and
unnecessary computation on static or content-poor ones. To address this, we
propose LangDC, a Language-aware Dynamic Token Compressor. LangDC leverages a
lightweight language model to describe video clips, converting them into soft
caption tokens as visual representations. Trained with our proposed semantic
density-aware supervision, LangDC aims to 1) cover key visual cues necessary
for downstream task reasoning and 2) dynamically adjust compression ratios
based on scene richness, reflected by descriptions length. Our design mimics
how humans dynamically express what they see: complex scenes (seeing more)
elicit more detailed language to convey nuances (saying more), whereas simpler
scenes are described with fewer words. Experimental results show that our
method reduces FLOPs by 49% compared to VideoGPT+ while maintaining competitive
performance. Furthermore, qualitative results demonstrate our approach
adaptively adjusts the token compression ratio based on video segment richness.

### [320] [Towards Integrating Multi-Spectral Imaging with Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00989)
*Josef Grün,Lukas Meyer,Maximilian Weiherer,Bernhard Egger,Marc Stamminger,Linus Franke*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper adapts 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for integrating both RGB and multi-spectral data, achieving improved 3D reconstruction from multi-view images by overcoming inconsistencies in geometry across spectral domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses challenges in integrating multi-modal data (RGB and multi-spectral imagery) into 3DGS for high-quality 3D reconstructions, motivated by the inconsistencies in geometry when optimizing across spectral domains separately.

Method: Three strategies were analyzed: (1) Separate per-band reconstruction without shared structure, (2) Splitting optimization with RGB geometry as the starting point, and (3) Joint optimization of RGB and multi-spectral bands with or without an initial RGB-only phase. The Joint strategy is emphasized.

Result: The Joint strategy demonstrates superior performance, improving overall spectral reconstruction and enhancing RGB results through spectral cross-talk. Quantitative metrics and qualitative renderings validate its effectiveness.

Conclusion: Integrating multi-spectral data via spherical harmonics in the 3DGS framework and using a Joint optimization strategy significantly improves reconstruction quality. The study also provides practical insights into balancing when and how spectral bands should be optimized.

Abstract: We present a study of how to integrate color (RGB) and multi-spectral imagery
(red, green, red-edge, and near-infrared) into the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
framework, a state-of-the-art explicit radiance-field-based method for fast and
high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from multi-view images. While 3DGS excels on
RGB data, naive per-band optimization of additional spectra yields poor
reconstructions due to inconsistently appearing geometry in the spectral
domain. This problem is prominent, even though the actual geometry is the same,
regardless of spectral modality. To investigate this, we evaluate three
strategies: 1) Separate per-band reconstruction with no shared structure. 2)
Splitting optimization, in which we first optimize RGB geometry, copy it, and
then fit each new band to the model by optimizing both geometry and band
representation. 3) Joint, in which the modalities are jointly optimized,
optionally with an initial RGB-only phase. We showcase through quantitative
metrics and qualitative novel-view renderings on multi-spectral datasets the
effectiveness of our dedicated optimized Joint strategy, increasing overall
spectral reconstruction as well as enhancing RGB results through spectral
cross-talk. We therefore suggest integrating multi-spectral data directly into
the spherical harmonics color components to compactly model each Gaussian's
multi-spectral reflectance. Moreover, our analysis reveals several key
trade-offs in when and how to introduce spectral bands during optimization,
offering practical insights for robust multi-modal 3DGS reconstruction.

*Ghazal Farhani,Taufiq Rahman,Dominique Charlebois*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study analyzes how rainy weather impacts drivers' gaze behavior, finding increased dashboard glances and cognitive focus under such conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how drivers' gaze behavior adapts to adverse conditions like rain for improving driver monitoring and assistance systems.

Method: The study employs a two-step clustering approach to analyze gaze behavior on a highway under clear and rainy conditions, using metrics like fixation duration and gaze elevation.

Result: Rainy conditions result in behavioral shifts such as more frequent dashboard glances, longer fixation durations, and higher gaze elevation.

Conclusion: Insights from gaze modeling under adverse conditions can inform the design of advanced driver assistance and monitoring systems.

Abstract: Rainy weather significantly increases the risk of road accidents due to
reduced visibility and vehicle traction. Understanding how experienced drivers
adapt their visual perception through gaze behavior under such conditions is
critical for designing robust driver monitoring systems (DMS) and for informing
advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). This case study investigates the eye
gaze behavior of a driver operating the same highway route under both clear and
rainy conditions. To this end, gaze behavior was analyzed by a two-step
clustering approach: first, clustering gaze points within 10-second intervals,
and then aggregating cluster centroids into meta-clusters. This, along with
Markov transition matrices and metrics such as fixation duration, gaze
elevation, and azimuth distributions, reveals meaningful behavioral shifts.
While the overall gaze behavior focused on the road with occasional mirror
checks remains consistent, rainy conditions lead to more frequent dashboard
glances, longer fixation durations, and higher gaze elevation, indicating
increased cognitive focus. These findings offer valuable insight into visual
attention patterns under adverse conditions and highlight the potential of
leveraging gaze modeling to aid in the design of more robust ADAS and DMS.

*Scarlett Raine,Benjamin Moshirian,Tobias Fischer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper discusses AI-driven automation for coral reef restoration, achieving significant accuracy in seafloor suitability detection and contributing a new dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is the urgent need to mitigate the collapse of coral reefs caused by climate change, ocean acidification, and pollution. Automation is critical for scaling restoration efforts to address this crisis.

Method: The authors use artificial intelligence, computer vision, and robotics to classify substrates automatically, detecting areas on the seafloor suitable for coral growth. This reduces the dependency on human experts and enhances restoration efficiency.

Result: Their method achieved a 77.8% deployment accuracy, 89.1% in sub-image patch classification, and 5.5 frames per second for real-time inference during tests on the Great Barrier Reef.

Conclusion: Automated coral reef restoration is not only feasible but effective. The study's contributions, including a publicly available annotated image dataset, will foster further advances in this critical field of environmental preservation.

Abstract: Coral reefs are on the brink of collapse, with climate change, ocean
acidification, and pollution leading to a projected 70-90% loss of coral
species within the next decade. Restoration efforts are crucial, but their
success hinges on introducing automation to upscale efforts. We present
automated deployment of coral re-seeding devices powered by artificial
intelligence, computer vision, and robotics. Specifically, we perform automated
substrate classification, enabling detection of areas of the seafloor suitable
for coral growth, thus significantly reducing reliance on human experts and
increasing the range and efficiency of restoration. Real-world testing of the
algorithms on the Great Barrier Reef leads to deployment accuracy of 77.8%,
sub-image patch classification of 89.1%, and real-time model inference at 5.5
frames per second. Further, we present and publicly contribute a large
collection of annotated substrate image data to foster future research in this
area.

*Zixin Zhu,Kevin Duarte,Mamshad Nayeem Rizve,Chengyuan Xu,Ratheesh Kalarot,Junsong Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CompSlider proposes an approach to achieve fine-grained and simultaneous control of multiple image attributes in text-to-image (T2I) generation using slider-based methods by disentangling attribute entanglement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image generation models struggle with precise multi-attribute control due to the entanglement of attributes, leading to interference between them.

Method: CompSlider operates in the latent space of a T2I foundation model by generating a conditional prior and introduces novel disentanglement and structure losses to enable reliable multi-attribute manipulation without retraining the foundation model.

Result: The method enables more reliable simultaneous control of multiple image attributes with reduced computational requirements, and is successfully extended to video generation tasks.

Conclusion: CompSlider achieves effective disentanglement of attributes, enabling precise multi-attribute control in T2I generation, maintaining structural consistency, and offering computational efficiency.

Abstract: In text-to-image (T2I) generation, achieving fine-grained control over
attributes - such as age or smile - remains challenging, even with detailed
text prompts. Slider-based methods offer a solution for precise control of
image attributes. Existing approaches typically train individual adapter for
each attribute separately, overlooking the entanglement among multiple
attributes. As a result, interference occurs among different attributes,
preventing precise control of multiple attributes together. To address this
challenge, we aim to disentangle multiple attributes in slider-based generation
to enbale more reliable and independent attribute manipulation. Our approach,
CompSlider, can generate a conditional prior for the T2I foundation model to
control multiple attributes simultaneously. Furthermore, we introduce novel
disentanglement and structure losses to compose multiple attribute changes
while maintaining structural consistency within the image. Since CompSlider
operates in the latent space of the conditional prior and does not require
retraining the foundation model, it reduces the computational burden for both
training and inference. We evaluate our approach on a variety of image
attributes and highlight its generality by extending to video generation.

*Qiang Li,Yuanming Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to restore images taken through contaminated glasses with diverse occlusions, using real paired images and a one-shot test-time adaptation mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of restoring images degraded by various real-world contaminants on window glasses.

Method: An all-in-one model with a one-shot test-time adaptation mechanism and a self-supervised auxiliary learning task to handle diverse occlusions.

Result: The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in both qualitative and quantitative metrics, especially for unseen contaminations.

Conclusion: The approach effectively restores images taken through glasses with real-world contaminants, demonstrating versatility across various occlusion types.

Abstract: Images taken through window glass are often degraded by contaminants adhered
to the glass surfaces. Such contaminants cause occlusions that attenuate the
incoming light and scatter stray light towards the camera. Most of existing
deep learning methods for neutralizing the effects of contaminated glasses
relied on synthetic training data. Few researchers used real degraded and clean
image pairs, but they only considered removing or alleviating the effects of
rain drops on glasses. This paper is concerned with the more challenging task
of learning the restoration of images taken through glasses contaminated by a
wide range of occluders, including muddy water, dirt and other small foreign
particles found in reality. To facilitate the learning task we have gone to a
great length to acquire real paired images with and without glass contaminants.
More importantly, we propose an all-in-one model to neutralize contaminants of
different types by utilizing the one-shot test-time adaptation mechanism. It
involves a self-supervised auxiliary learning task to update the trained model
for the unique occlusion type of each test image. Experimental results show
that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods
quantitatively and qualitatively in cleaning realistic contaminated images,
especially the unseen ones.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified model called LPFM to tackle low-level image enhancement and translation challenges in computational pathology, outperforming traditional methods in various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of degraded and inconsistent real-world pathology images caused by artifacts, staining variability, and imaging constraints.

Method: A unified Low-level Pathology Foundation Model (LPFM) leveraging a contrastive pre-trained encoder and conditional diffusion, trained on vast datasets, enabling enhanced restoration and translation capabilities.

Result: LPFM achieved significant improvements in metrics like PSNR (10-15%) and SSIM (12-18%) across tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods (success in 56/66 tasks).

Conclusion: LPFM effectively bridges the gap in pathology image enhancement and demonstrates its versatility and superior performance across multiple tasks, marking an advancement in computational pathology.

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized computational pathology by achieving
remarkable success in high-level diagnostic tasks, yet the critical challenge
of low-level image enhancement remains largely unaddressed. Real-world
pathology images frequently suffer from degradations such as noise, blur, and
low resolution due to slide preparation artifacts, staining variability, and
imaging constraints, while the reliance on physical staining introduces
significant costs, delays, and inconsistency. Although existing methods target
individual problems like denoising or super-resolution, their task-specific
designs lack the versatility to handle the diverse low-level vision challenges
encountered in practice. To bridge this gap, we propose the first unified
Low-level Pathology Foundation Model (LPFM), capable of enhancing image quality
in restoration tasks, including super-resolution, deblurring, and denoising, as
well as facilitating image translation tasks like virtual staining (H&E and
special stains), all through a single adaptable architecture. Our approach
introduces a contrastive pre-trained encoder that learns transferable,
stain-invariant feature representations from 190 million unlabeled pathology
images, enabling robust identification of degradation patterns. A unified
conditional diffusion process dynamically adapts to specific tasks via textual
prompts, ensuring precise control over output quality. Trained on a curated
dataset of 87,810 whole slied images (WSIs) across 34 tissue types and 5
staining protocols, LPFM demonstrates statistically significant improvements
(p<0.01) over state-of-the-art methods in most tasks (56/66), achieving Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) gains of 10-15% for image restoration and
Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) improvements of 12-18% for virtual
staining.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SpectMamba, a novel Mamba-based architecture for detecting abnormalities in medical imaging that achieves state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of CNNs and Transformers in medical imaging, such as restricted ability to capture broad context or computational inefficiency.

Method: They present SpectMamba, leveraging a Hybrid Spatial-Frequency Attention (HSFA) block, Visual State-Space Module (VSSM), and a Hilbert Curve Scanning technique to effectively capture global context and enhance long-range dependencies.

Result: SpectMamba outperforms existing models in terms of efficiency and accuracy across various medical imaging detection tasks.

Conclusion: SpectMamba demonstrates that combining advanced techniques like HSFA blocks and VSSM can create an efficient, accurate, and scalable solution for medical imaging analysis.

Abstract: Abnormality detection in medical imaging is a critical task requiring both
high efficiency and accuracy to support effective diagnosis. While
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based models are widely
used, both face intrinsic challenges: CNNs have limited receptive fields,
restricting their ability to capture broad contextual information, and
Transformers encounter prohibitive computational costs when processing
high-resolution medical images. Mamba, a recent innovation in natural language
processing, has gained attention for its ability to process long sequences with
linear complexity, offering a promising alternative. Building on this
foundation, we present SpectMamba, the first Mamba-based architecture designed
for medical image detection. A key component of SpectMamba is the Hybrid
Spatial-Frequency Attention (HSFA) block, which separately learns high- and
low-frequency features. This approach effectively mitigates the loss of
high-frequency information caused by frequency bias and correlates
frequency-domain features with spatial features, thereby enhancing the model's
ability to capture global context. To further improve long-range dependencies,
we propose the Visual State-Space Module (VSSM) and introduce a novel Hilbert
Curve Scanning technique to strengthen spatial correlations and local
dependencies, further optimizing the Mamba framework. Comprehensive experiments
show that SpectMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance while being both
effective and efficient across various medical image detection tasks.

*Chenlu Zhan,Wen Li,Chuyu Shen,Jun Zhang,Suhui Wu,Hao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents Bidirectional Sparse Attention (BSA), a method to make video diffusion Transformer (DiT) models more efficient by dynamically sparsifying Queries and Key-Value pairs, alleviating computational burdens while maintaining high-quality video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video diffusion Transformer models excel in generating high-quality videos but face computational bottlenecks for high-resolution, long-duration videos due to the inefficiency of full attention mechanisms.

Method: The paper introduces Bidirectional Sparse Attention (BSA), which dynamically sparsifies Queries and Key-Value pairs. Query sparsity leverages semantic similarity and a spatial-time strategy, while KV sparsity uses dynamic thresholds to retain salient blocks.

Result: BSA achieves substantial computational savings, reducing FLOPs by up to 20x and making attention training 17.79x faster, while maintaining or improving generative quality.

Conclusion: The BSA framework significantly improves the efficiency of video DiTs without compromising output quality, offering a solution to computational bottlenecks in training and inference.

Abstract: Video diffusion Transformer (DiT) models excel in generative quality but hit
major computational bottlenecks when producing high-resolution, long-duration
videos. The quadratic complexity of full attention leads to prohibitively high
training and inference costs. Full attention inefficiency stems from two key
challenges: excessive computation due to the inherent sparsity of Queries and
Key-Value pairs, and redundant computation as fixed sparse patterns fail to
leverage DiT's dynamic attention. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
Bidirectional Sparse Attention (BSA) framework for faster video DiT training,
the first to dynamically sparsify both Queries and Key-Value pairs within 3D
full attention, thereby substantially improving training and inference
efficiency. BSA addresses these issues through two key components. Query
sparsity is optimized by selecting the most informative query tokens via
semantic similarity and with a dynamic spatial-time training strategy, while KV
sparsity is achieved by computing a statistical dynamic threshold to retain
only the most salient KV blocks for computation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that BSA significantly accelerates DiT training across long
sequences, reducing FLOPs by up to 20x and achieving 17.79x faster attention
training, while preserving or even surpassing the generative quality of full
attention.

### [328] [An End-to-End Framework for Video Multi-Person Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01095)
*Zhihong Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VEPE, an end-to-end framework for video-based human pose estimation that tackles spatio-temporal limitations in current methods, demonstrating superior accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pose estimation methods struggle with issues like motion blur, out-of-focus, and occlusions due to separating spatial and temporal contexts, and inefficiencies from complex post-processing steps.

Method: VEPE employs three spatio-temporal Transformer components—STPE, STDME, and STPD—and introduces an instance consistency mechanism for better cross-frame pose query matching and tracking.

Result: Extensive testing on the Posetrack dataset shows VEPE surpassing existing two-stage models in accuracy while improving inference efficiency by 300%.

Conclusion: VEPE proves to be a simple yet effective solution for end-to-end video pose estimation, addressing current challenges in spatio-temporal modeling and inference efficiency.

Abstract: Video-based human pose estimation models aim to address scenarios that cannot
be effectively solved by static image models such as motion blur, out-of-focus
and occlusion. Most existing approaches consist of two stages: detecting human
instances in each image frame and then using a temporal model for single-person
pose estimation. This approach separates the spatial and temporal dimensions
and cannot capture the global spatio-temporal context between spatial instances
for end-to-end optimization. In addition, it relies on separate detectors and
complex post-processing such as RoI cropping and NMS, which reduces the
inference efficiency of the video scene. To address the above problems, we
propose VEPE (Video End-to-End Pose Estimation), a simple and flexible
framework for end-to-end pose estimation in video. The framework utilizes three
crucial spatio-temporal Transformer components: the Spatio-Temporal Pose
Encoder (STPE), the Spatio-Temporal Deformable Memory Encoder (STDME), and the
Spatio-Temporal Pose Decoder (STPD). These components are designed to
effectively utilize temporal context for optimizing human body pose estimation.
Furthermore, to reduce the mismatch problem during the cross-frame pose query
matching process, we propose an instance consistency mechanism, which aims to
enhance the consistency and discrepancy of the cross-frame instance query and
realize the instance tracking function, which in turn accurately guides the
pose query to perform cross-frame matching. Extensive experiments on the
Posetrack dataset show that our approach outperforms most two-stage models and
improves inference efficiency by 300%.

*Xuan Deng,Xingtao Wang,Xiandong Meng,Xiaopeng Fan,Debin Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PVINet, a novel network for point cloud compression that integrates global and local features in parallel through point-voxel interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing inefficiencies in point cloud compression methods where global and local information interactions are sequential and lack communication.

Method: A point-voxel interlaced network (PVINet) utilizing parallel encoders for global (voxel-based) and local (point-based) feature extraction, coupled with a novel conditional sparse convolution for dynamic interaction between these features.

Result: PVINet demonstrated competitive performance against current state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: PVINet enhances point cloud compression by efficiently integrating global structure and local context, improving feature perception and reconstruction quality.

Abstract: In point cloud compression, the quality of a reconstructed point cloud relies
on both the global structure and the local context, with existing methods
usually processing global and local information sequentially and lacking
communication between these two types of information. In this paper, we propose
a point-voxel interlaced network (PVINet), which captures global structural
features and local contextual features in parallel and performs interactions at
each scale to enhance feature perception efficiency. Specifically, PVINet
contains a voxel-based encoder (Ev) for extracting global structural features
and a point-based encoder (Ep) that models local contexts centered at each
voxel. Particularly, a novel conditional sparse convolution is introduced,
which applies point embeddings to dynamically customize kernels for voxel
feature extraction, facilitating feature interactions from Ep to Ev. During
decoding, a voxel-based decoder employs conditional sparse convolutions to
incorporate point embeddings as guidance to reconstruct the point cloud.
Experiments on benchmark datasets show that PVINet delivers competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

### [330] [FICGen: Frequency-Inspired Contextual Disentanglement for Layout-driven Degraded Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01107)
*Wenzhuang Wang,Yifan Zhao,Mingcan Ma,Ming Liu,Zhonglin Jiang,Yong Chen,Jia Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents FICGen, a novel generative model tailored for layout-to-image synthesis in degraded environments, which leverages frequency-aware guidance to enhance generative fidelity and alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of existing Layout-to-Image (L2I) generation models when applied to degraded conditions. Current approaches struggle due to the 'contextual illusion dilemma,' where foreground details are overshadowed by context-dominant frequencies in low-light or underwater imagery.

Method: The proposed FICGen paradigm adopts a two-step approach: (1) A dual-query mechanism with frequency resamplers extracts contextual frequency prototypes from degraded training data; (2) Visual-frequency enhanced attention injects these prototypes during the generation process. Additionally, an instance coherence map prevents contextual confusion, while a spatial-frequency aggregation module reconstructs degraded representations effectively.

Result: Extensive experiments on five benchmarks across various degraded environments (e.g., low-light, blur) show that FICGen outperforms current L2I methods in generative fidelity, user layout alignment, and auxiliary task performance.

Conclusion: FICGen establishes itself as a state-of-the-art method for L2I generation in degraded scenarios by addressing challenges in contextual disentanglement and frequency adaptation, resulting in superior visual and functional outcomes compared to existing models.

Abstract: Layout-to-image (L2I) generation has exhibited promising results in natural
domains, but suffers from limited generative fidelity and weak alignment with
user-provided layouts when applied to degraded scenes (i.e., low-light,
underwater). We primarily attribute these limitations to the "contextual
illusion dilemma" in degraded conditions, where foreground instances are
overwhelmed by context-dominant frequency distributions. Motivated by this, our
paper proposes a new Frequency-Inspired Contextual Disentanglement Generative
(FICGen) paradigm, which seeks to transfer frequency knowledge of degraded
images into the latent diffusion space, thereby facilitating the rendering of
degraded instances and their surroundings via contextual frequency-aware
guidance. To be specific, FICGen consists of two major steps. Firstly, we
introduce a learnable dual-query mechanism, each paired with a dedicated
frequency resampler, to extract contextual frequency prototypes from
pre-collected degraded exemplars in the training set. Secondly, a
visual-frequency enhanced attention is employed to inject frequency prototypes
into the degraded generation process. To alleviate the contextual illusion and
attribute leakage, an instance coherence map is developed to regulate
latent-space disentanglement between individual instances and their
surroundings, coupled with an adaptive spatial-frequency aggregation module to
reconstruct spatial-frequency mixed degraded representations. Extensive
experiments on 5 benchmarks involving a variety of degraded scenarios-from
severe low-light to mild blur-demonstrate that FICGen consistently surpasses
existing L2I methods in terms of generative fidelity, alignment and downstream
auxiliary trainability.

*Zhengqiang Zhang,Rongyuan Wu,Lingchen Sun,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPSToken introduces non-uniform image tokenization using parametric 2D Gaussians for improved image representation and generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional tokenization methods are limited by uniform 2D/1D grids, which restrict their ability to represent diverse image regions accurately.

Method: GPSToken partitions images into texture-homogeneous regions using an entropy-driven algorithm and parameterizes them as 2D Gaussians. A transformer optimizes these parameters, enabling adaptive tokenization and content-aware feature extraction.

Result: GPSToken achieves superior performance in image reconstruction and generation tasks, with rFID and FID scores of 0.65 and 1.50, respectively, using 128 tokens.

Conclusion: By dynamically modeling image regions with 2D Gaussian parameters, GPSToken offers a flexible and efficient framework for tokenization, achieving state-of-the-art results in image tasks.

Abstract: Effective and efficient tokenization plays an important role in image
representation and generation. Conventional methods, constrained by uniform
2D/1D grid tokenization, are inflexible to represent regions with varying
shapes and textures and at different locations, limiting their efficacy of
feature representation. In this work, we propose $\textbf{GPSToken}$, a novel
$\textbf{G}$aussian $\textbf{P}$arameterized $\textbf{S}$patially-adaptive
$\textbf{Token}$ization framework, to achieve non-uniform image tokenization by
leveraging parametric 2D Gaussians to dynamically model the shape, position,
and textures of different image regions. We first employ an entropy-driven
algorithm to partition the image into texture-homogeneous regions of variable
sizes. Then, we parameterize each region as a 2D Gaussian (mean for position,
covariance for shape) coupled with texture features. A specialized transformer
is trained to optimize the Gaussian parameters, enabling continuous adaptation
of position/shape and content-aware feature extraction. During decoding,
Gaussian parameterized tokens are reconstructed into 2D feature maps through a
differentiable splatting-based renderer, bridging our adaptive tokenization
with standard decoders for end-to-end training. GPSToken disentangles spatial
layout (Gaussian parameters) from texture features to enable efficient
two-stage generation: structural layout synthesis using lightweight networks,
followed by structure-conditioned texture generation. Experiments demonstrate
the state-of-the-art performance of GPSToken, which achieves rFID and FID
scores of 0.65 and 1.50 on image reconstruction and generation tasks using 128
tokens, respectively. Codes and models of GPSToken can be found at

### [332] [MetaSSL: A General Heterogeneous Loss for Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01144)
*Weiren Zhao,Lanfeng Zhong,Xin Liao,Wenjun Liao,Sichuan Zhang,Shaoting Zhang,Guotai Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MetaSSL, a framework leveraging spatially heterogeneous loss to enhance semi-supervised learning for medical image segmentation by considering pixel-wise confidence and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SSL methods focus on reference prediction generation but neglect noise in labeled data and the heterogeneity of unlabeled pixel values, limiting effectiveness.

Method: MetaSSL assigns adaptive weights in loss functions based on pixel-wise uncertainty and consistency, categorizing predictions into four regions (UC, US, DC, DS) with decreasing weights.

Result: MetaSSL significantly improves segmentation performance when integrated with various SSL methods on diverse datasets.

Conclusion: MetaSSL is a robust, general, and plug-and-play framework that strengthens semi-supervised medical image segmentation models by utilizing spatially heterogeneous loss.

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) is important for reducing the annotation cost
for medical image segmentation models. State-of-the-art SSL methods such as
Mean Teacher, FixMatch and Cross Pseudo Supervision (CPS) are mainly based on
consistency regularization or pseudo-label supervision between a reference
prediction and a supervised prediction. Despite the effectiveness, they have
overlooked the potential noise in the labeled data, and mainly focus on
strategies to generate the reference prediction, while ignoring the
heterogeneous values of different unlabeled pixels. We argue that effectively
mining the rich information contained by the two predictions in the loss
function, instead of the specific strategy to obtain a reference prediction, is
more essential for SSL, and propose a universal framework MetaSSL based on a
spatially heterogeneous loss that assigns different weights to pixels by
simultaneously leveraging the uncertainty and consistency information between
the reference and supervised predictions. Specifically, we split the
predictions on unlabeled data into four regions with decreasing weights in the
loss: Unanimous and Confident (UC), Unanimous and Suspicious (US), Discrepant
and Confident (DC), and Discrepant and Suspicious (DS), where an adaptive
threshold is proposed to distinguish confident predictions from suspicious
ones. The heterogeneous loss is also applied to labeled images for robust
learning considering the potential annotation noise. Our method is
plug-and-play and general to most existing SSL methods. The experimental
results showed that it improved the segmentation performance significantly when
integrated with existing SSL frameworks on different datasets. Code is
available at https://github.com/HiLab-git/MetaSSL.

*Taiga Yamane,Ryo Masumura,Satoshi Suzuki,Shota Orihashi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MVTrajecter, an end-to-end method for multi-view pedestrian tracking that leverages information from multiple timestamps for more robust pedestrian association.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve multi-view pedestrian tracking (MVPT) by addressing the limitation of previous methods that rely only on the current and single adjacent past timestamp, neglecting the rich information in prolonged past trajectories.

Method: The proposed MVTrajecter incorporates trajectory motion cost and trajectory appearance cost to integrate motion and appearance data from multiple timestamps, and utilizes the attention mechanism to effectively model relationships across these timestamps.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of key components in MVTrajecter and show that it achieves superior performance compared to previous state-of-the-art methods in MVPT.

Conclusion: MVTrajecter provides a substantial improvement in multi-view pedestrian tracking by leveraging longer past trajectories and employing novel costs for better association of pedestrians, offering a more robust end-to-end tracking solution.

Abstract: Multi-View Pedestrian Tracking (MVPT) aims to track pedestrians in the form
of a bird's eye view occupancy map from multi-view videos. End-to-end methods
that detect and associate pedestrians within one model have shown great
progress in MVPT. The motion and appearance information of pedestrians is
important for the association, but previous end-to-end MVPT methods rely only
on the current and its single adjacent past timestamp, discarding the past
trajectories before that. This paper proposes a novel end-to-end MVPT method
called Multi-View Trajectory Tracker (MVTrajecter) that utilizes information
from multiple timestamps in past trajectories for robust association.
MVTrajecter introduces trajectory motion cost and trajectory appearance cost to
effectively incorporate motion and appearance information, respectively. These
costs calculate which pedestrians at the current and each past timestamp are
likely identical based on the information between those timestamps. Even if a
current pedestrian could be associated with a false pedestrian at some past
timestamp, these costs enable the model to associate that current pedestrian
with the correct past trajectory based on other past timestamps. In addition,
MVTrajecter effectively captures the relationships between multiple timestamps
leveraging the attention mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of each component in MVTrajecter and show that it outperforms the
previous state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel Vision Transformer model for improved catheter segmentation and 3D force estimation using stereo X-ray images, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance catheterization procedures by improving the quality of tactile and visual perception data derived from X-ray imaging through a new architecture.

Method: The paper presents a stereo Vision Transformer model that processes two X-ray images as separate sequences, using a transformer architecture for long-range dependency capture and integrating segmentation and 3D force estimation tasks.

Result: The proposed model shows superiority in catheter segmentation and 3D force estimation tasks when tested on synthetic X-ray datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The Vision Transformer architecture introduces advancements in stereo catheter segmentation and 3D force estimation, pushing state-of-the-art performance and offering a promising solution for multitask learning in this domain.

Abstract: Recently, the emergence of multitask deep learning models has enhanced
catheterization procedures by providing tactile and visual perception data
through an end-to-end architec- ture. This information is derived from a
segmentation and force estimation head, which localizes the catheter in X-ray
images and estimates the applied pressure based on its deflection within the
image. These stereo vision architectures incorporate a CNN- based
encoder-decoder that captures the dependencies between X-ray images from two
viewpoints, enabling simultaneous 3D force estimation and stereo segmentation
of the catheter. With these tasks in mind, this work approaches the problem
from a new perspective. We propose a novel encoder-decoder Vision Transformer
model that processes two input X-ray images as separate sequences. Given
sequences of X-ray patches from two perspectives, the transformer captures
long-range dependencies without the need to gradually expand the receptive
field for either image. The embeddings generated by both the encoder and
decoder are fed into two shared segmentation heads, while a regression head
employs the fused information from the decoder for 3D force estimation. The
proposed model is a stereo Vision Transformer capable of simultaneously
segmenting the catheter from two angles while estimating the generated forces
at its tip in 3D. This model has undergone extensive experiments on synthetic
X-ray images with various noise levels and has been compared against
state-of-the-art pure segmentation models, vision-based catheter force
estimation methods, and a multitask catheter segmentation and force estimation
approach. It outperforms existing models, setting a new state-of-the-art in
both catheter segmentation and force estimation.

*Hyunjong Ok,Jaeho Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper highlights limitations in vision-language encoders used for selecting keyframes in multimodal large language models for video tasks, calling for improved techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video understanding with multimodal large language models depends on keyframe selection to reduce computational costs, yet it is uncertain whether existing methods identify the most relevant frames.

Method: The authors evaluate the performance of vision encoders in selecting informative frames and examine their ability to focus on query-specific video segments.

Result: Empirical evidence shows that popular vision encoders struggle to accurately select keyframes tailored to textual queries.

Conclusion: Advancing keyframe identification approaches is crucial for improving the efficiency of video-processing multimodal models.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have led to much
progress in video understanding tasks. To avoid the heavy computational cost of
processing all frames, these models typically rely on keyframe sampling methods
guided by vision-language encoders (\textit{e.g.,} SigLIP). However, it remains
unclear whether such encoders can truly identify the most informative frames.
In this work, we provide several empirical pieces of evidence revealing that
popular vision encoders critically suffer from their limited capability to
identify where the MLLM should look inside the video to handle the given
textual query appropriately. Our findings suggest that the development of
better keyframe identification techniques may be necessary for efficient video
MLLMs.

### [336] [DynaMind: Reconstructing Dynamic Visual Scenes from EEG by Aligning Temporal Dynamics and Multimodal Semantics to Guided Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01177)
*Junxiang Liu,Junming Lin,Jiangtong Li,Jie Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DynaMind is a framework for reconstructing video from EEG by integrating neural dynamics and semantics, achieving state-of-the-art visual fidelity and coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods fail to adequately resolve the dynamic coherence and semantic complexity of perceived visual stimuli due to EEG's low spatial resolution, temporal mismatches, and underutilization of semantic information.

Method: DynaMind employs three modules: the Regional-aware Semantic Mapper (RSM) for extracting and aggregating semantic features, the Temporal-aware Dynamic Aligner (TDA) for creating temporally consistent feature sequences, and the Dual-Guidance Video Reconstructor (DGVR) for translating these sequences into high-fidelity videos.

Result: DynaMind significantly improves video reconstruction accuracy by 12.5 percentage points (video-based) and 10.3 percentage points (frame-based) while enhancing pixel-level quality with a 9.4% increase in SSIM and a 19.7% reduction in FVMD.

Conclusion: The framework effectively bridges the gap between neural dynamics and high-fidelity visual semantics, representing a critical advancement in brain decoding.

Abstract: Reconstruction dynamic visual scenes from electroencephalography (EEG)
signals remains a primary challenge in brain decoding, limited by the low
spatial resolution of EEG, a temporal mismatch between neural recordings and
video dynamics, and the insufficient use of semantic information within brain
activity. Therefore, existing methods often inadequately resolve both the
dynamic coherence and the complex semantic context of the perceived visual
stimuli. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DynaMind, a novel
framework that reconstructs video by jointly modeling neural dynamics and
semantic features via three core modules: a Regional-aware Semantic Mapper
(RSM), a Temporal-aware Dynamic Aligner (TDA), and a Dual-Guidance Video
Reconstructor (DGVR). The RSM first utilizes a regional-aware encoder to
extract multimodal semantic features from EEG signals across distinct brain
regions, aggregating them into a unified diffusion prior. In the mean time, the
TDA generates a dynamic latent sequence, or blueprint, to enforce temporal
consistency between the feature representations and the original neural
recordings. Together, guided by the semantic diffusion prior, the DGVR
translates the temporal-aware blueprint into a high-fidelity video
reconstruction. On the SEED-DV dataset, DynaMind sets a new state-of-the-art
(SOTA), boosting reconstructed video accuracies (video- and frame-based) by
12.5 and 10.3 percentage points, respectively. It also achieves a leap in
pixel-level quality, showing exceptional visual fidelity and temporal coherence
with a 9.4% SSIM improvement and a 19.7% FVMD reduction. This marks a critical
advancement, bridging the gap between neural dynamics and high-fidelity visual
semantics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FocusDPO is a framework for generating personalized images of multiple subjects with improved subject fidelity and reduced attribute leakage, outperforming other methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to enable fine-grained, independent control over multiple specified subjects in personalized image generation while maintaining subject fidelity and avoiding cross-subject attribute leakage.

Method: FocusDPO uses adaptive identification of focus regions based on dynamic semantic correspondence and image complexity, with progressive adjustments and weighted strategies to improve synthesis during the sampling process.

Result: FocusDPO demonstrates enhanced performance of pre-trained models, achieving state-of-the-art results in single- and multi-subject personalized image synthesis.

Conclusion: The proposed method advances personalized image generation by offering superior control over multi-subject synthesis, reducing attribute leakage, and maintaining subject fidelity effectively.

Abstract: Multi-subject personalized image generation aims to synthesize customized
images containing multiple specified subjects without requiring test-time
optimization. However, achieving fine-grained independent control over multiple
subjects remains challenging due to difficulties in preserving subject fidelity
and preventing cross-subject attribute leakage. We present FocusDPO, a
framework that adaptively identifies focus regions based on dynamic semantic
correspondence and supervision image complexity. During training, our method
progressively adjusts these focal areas across noise timesteps, implementing a
weighted strategy that rewards information-rich patches while penalizing
regions with low prediction confidence. The framework dynamically adjusts focus
allocation during the DPO process according to the semantic complexity of
reference images and establishes robust correspondence mappings between
generated and reference subjects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method substantially enhances the performance of existing pre-trained
personalized generation models, achieving state-of-the-art results on both
single-subject and multi-subject personalized image synthesis benchmarks. Our
method effectively mitigates attribute leakage while preserving superior
subject fidelity across diverse generation scenarios, advancing the frontier of
controllable multi-subject image synthesis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel method called SegAssess for unsupervised segmentation quality assessment (SQA) using a panoramic quality mapping (PQM) approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning-based unsupervised SQA methods suffer from coarse granularity, incomplete assessments, and poor transferability.

Method: It introduces a new framework, SegAssess, based on the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with innovative techniques such as Edge Guided Compaction (EGC), Aggregated Semantic Filter (ASF), and Augmented Mixup Sampling (AMS).

Result: SegAssess achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and demonstrates significant transferability across 32 datasets from 6 sources.

Conclusion: SegAssess establishes itself as a robust and effective solution for unsupervised segmentation quality assessment in remote sensing with its innovative PQM paradigm.

Abstract: High-quality image segmentation is fundamental to pixel-level geospatial
analysis in remote sensing, necessitating robust segmentation quality
assessment (SQA), particularly in unsupervised settings lacking ground truth.
Although recent deep learning (DL) based unsupervised SQA methods show
potential, they often suffer from coarse evaluation granularity, incomplete
assessments, and poor transferability. To overcome these limitations, this
paper introduces Panoramic Quality Mapping (PQM) as a new paradigm for
comprehensive, pixel-wise SQA, and presents SegAssess, a novel deep learning
framework realizing this approach. SegAssess distinctively formulates SQA as a
fine-grained, four-class panoramic segmentation task, classifying pixels within
a segmentation mask under evaluation into true positive (TP), false positive
(FP), true negative (TN), and false negative (FN) categories, thereby
generating a complete quality map. Leveraging an enhanced Segment Anything
Model (SAM) architecture, SegAssess uniquely employs the input mask as a prompt
for effective feature integration via cross-attention. Key innovations include
an Edge Guided Compaction (EGC) branch with an Aggregated Semantic Filter (ASF)
module to refine predictions near challenging object edges, and an Augmented
Mixup Sampling (AMS) training strategy integrating multi-source masks to
significantly boost cross-domain robustness and zero-shot transferability.
Comprehensive experiments across 32 datasets derived from 6 sources demonstrate
that SegAssess achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and exhibits
remarkable zero-shot transferability to unseen masks, establishing PQM via
SegAssess as a robust and transferable solution for unsupervised SQA. The code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of high-resolution datasets for training deep learning models capable of predicting tree growth using multi-temporal imagery and aid in forest monitoring.

Method: The authors provide the PrediTree dataset alongside an encoder-decoder framework leveraging U-Net architecture. The model utilizes multi-temporal multi-spectral imagery and relative time differences for canopy height prediction.

Result: The U-Net architecture achieved the lowest masked mean squared error of 11.78%, outperforming ResNet-50 by 12% and RGB-only data experiments by 30%.

Conclusion: PrediTree is a valuable resource for developing deep learning models in forest monitoring. It sets a benchmark for tree height prediction and is broadly accessible with accompanying codes.

Abstract: We present PrediTree, the first comprehensive open-source dataset designed
for training and evaluating tree height prediction models at sub-meter
resolution. This dataset combines very high-resolution (0.5m) LiDAR-derived
canopy height maps, spatially aligned with multi-temporal and multi-spectral
imagery, across diverse forest ecosystems in France, totaling 3,141,568 images.
PrediTree addresses a critical gap in forest monitoring capabilities by
enabling the training of deep learning methods that can predict tree growth
based on multiple past observations. %\sout{Initially focused on French
forests, PrediTree is designed as an expanding resource with ongoing efforts to
incorporate data from other countries. } To make use of this PrediTree dataset,
we propose an encoder-decoder framework that requires the multi-temporal
multi-spectral imagery and the relative time differences in years between the
canopy height map timestamp (target) and each image acquisition date for which
this framework predicts the canopy height. The conducted experiments
demonstrate that a U-Net architecture trained on the PrediTree dataset provides
the highest masked mean squared error of $11.78\%$, outperforming the next-best
architecture, ResNet-50, by around $12\%$, and cutting the error of the same
experiments but on fewer bands (red, green, blue only), by around $30\%$. This

TL;DR: DcMatch is an unsupervised framework for matching multiple 3D shapes, leveraging graph attention and dual-level consistency for enhanced accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge in establishing point-to-point correspondences across multiple 3D shapes, a key task in vision and graphics, often lacks robust and coherent solutions.

Method: The method introduces a shape graph attention network for constructing a shared latent space, incorporates both spatial and spectral representations, and employs a novel cycle consistency loss for alignment.

Result: DcMatch achieves consistent outperformance over state-of-the-art methods in various multi-shape matching benchmarks.

Conclusion: DcMatch offers a robust and unsupervised solution for 3D shape matching, ensuring accurate and coherent mappings through its novel techniques.

Abstract: Establishing point-to-point correspondences across multiple 3D shapes is a
fundamental problem in computer vision and graphics. In this paper, we
introduce DcMatch, a novel unsupervised learning framework for non-rigid
multi-shape matching. Unlike existing methods that learn a canonical embedding
from a single shape, our approach leverages a shape graph attention network to
capture the underlying manifold structure of the entire shape collection. This
enables the construction of a more expressive and robust shared latent space,
leading to more consistent shape-to-universe correspondences via a universe
predictor. Simultaneously, we represent these correspondences in both the
spatial and spectral domains and enforce their alignment in the shared universe
space through a novel cycle consistency loss. This dual-level consistency
fosters more accurate and coherent mappings. Extensive experiments on several
challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
previous state-of-the-art approaches across diverse multi-shape matching
scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/YeTianwei/DcMatch.

TL;DR: The paper enhances Visual Place Recognition (VPR) using event cameras by employing an ensemble-based approach. The method significantly improves robustness under diverse lighting conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VPR systems using conventional cameras face challenges under severe illumination changes, making it hard for visual place recognition in dynamic lighting environments. Event cameras offer potential benefits but lack a robust framework.

Method: The authors propose an ensemble approach integrating multiple event-to-frame reconstructions, VPR feature extractors, and varied temporal resolutions. This strategy enhances robustness as compared to using only temporal resolution-based fusion.

Result: Achieved a 57% relative improvement in Recall@1 for VPR under day-night lighting transitions. Tested on two long-term driving datasets without metric subsampling for natural variability, and analyzed key design parameters for optimal performance.

Conclusion: The ensemble approach effectively addresses lighting robustness challenges in VPR with event cameras. The proposed enhancements and systematic analysis set a foundation for improved real-world implementations and future research.

Abstract: Compared to conventional cameras, event cameras provide a high dynamic range
and low latency, offering greater robustness to rapid motion and challenging
lighting conditions. Although the potential of event cameras for visual place
recognition (VPR) has been established, developing robust VPR frameworks under
severe illumination changes remains an open research problem. In this paper, we
introduce an ensemble-based approach to event camera place recognition that
combines sequence-matched results from multiple event-to-frame reconstructions,
VPR feature extractors, and temporal resolutions. Unlike previous event-based
ensemble methods, which only utilise temporal resolution, our broader fusion
strategy delivers significantly improved robustness under varied lighting
conditions (e.g., afternoon, sunset, night), achieving a 57% relative
improvement in Recall@1 across day-night transitions. We evaluate our approach
on two long-term driving datasets (with 8 km per traverse) without metric
subsampling, thereby preserving natural variations in speed and stop duration
that influence event density. We also conduct a comprehensive analysis of key
design choices, including binning strategies, polarity handling, reconstruction
methods, and feature extractors, to identify the most critical components for
robust performance. Additionally, we propose a modification to the standard
sequence matching framework that enhances performance at longer sequence
lengths. To facilitate future research, we will release our codebase and
benchmarking framework.

Result: The approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods on both simulated and realistic datasets, excelling in zero-shot depth estimation for diverse endoscopic scenes.

Conclusion: This method enhances endoscopic perception accuracy, aiding minimally invasive measurements and surgeries, while showing promising results for future applications.

Abstract: Self-supervised monocular depth estimation is a significant task for low-cost
and efficient three-dimensional scene perception in endoscopy. The variety of
illumination conditions and scene features is still the primary challenge for
generalizable depth estimation in endoscopic scenes. In this work, a
self-supervised framework is proposed for monocular depth estimation in various
endoscopy. Firstly, due to various features in endoscopic scenes with different
tissues, a novel block-wise mixture of dynamic low-rank experts is proposed to
efficiently finetuning the foundation model for endoscopic depth estimation. In
the proposed module, based on the input feature, different experts with a small
amount of trainable parameters are adaptively selected for weighted inference,
from various mixture of low-rank experts which are allocated based on the
training quality of each block. Moreover, a novel self-supervised training
framework is proposed to jointly cope with the inconsistency of brightness and
reflectance. The proposed method outperform state-of-the-art works on both
realistic and simulated endoscopic datasets. Furthermore, the proposed network
also achieves the best generalization based on zero-shot depth estimation on
diverse endoscopic scenes. The proposed method could contribute to accurate
endoscopic perception for minimally invasive measurement and surgery. The code
will be released upon acceptance, while the demo video can be found on here:

*Maëlic Neau,Zoe Falomir,Cédric Buche,Akihiro Sugimoto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new evaluation metric and a method for generating high-quality synthetic data to improve Open-Vocabulary Scene Graph Generation (SGG).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SGG benchmarks have a limited vocabulary, making evaluation inefficient, and existing pre-training data for Open-Vocabulary SGG is of poor quality.

Method: They introduce a reference-free metric for fair evaluation and suggest using region-specific prompt tuning in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to generate high-quality synthetic data for pre-training.

Result: Experimental results show that the proposed synthetic data improves the generalization capabilities of Open-Vocabulary SGG models.

Conclusion: Their approach addresses key limitations in Open-Vocabulary SGG by enhancing evaluation fairness and improving data quality for pre-training.

Abstract: Scene Graph Generation (SGG) encodes visual relationships between objects in
images as graph structures. Thanks to the advances of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), the task of Open-Vocabulary SGG has been recently proposed where models
are evaluated on their functionality to learn a wide and diverse range of
relations. Current benchmarks in SGG, however, possess a very limited
vocabulary, making the evaluation of open-source models inefficient. In this
paper, we propose a new reference-free metric to fairly evaluate the
open-vocabulary capabilities of VLMs for relation prediction. Another
limitation of Open-Vocabulary SGG is the reliance on weakly supervised data of
poor quality for pre-training. We also propose a new solution for quickly
generating high-quality synthetic data through region-specific prompt tuning of
VLMs. Experimental results show that pre-training with this new data split can
benefit the generalization capabilities of Open-Voc SGG models.

*Yizhe Yuan,Bingsen Xue,Bangzheng Pu,Chengxiang Wang,Cheng Jin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRINTER overcomes spatial misalignment issues in tumor spatial heterogeneity analysis by introducing a weakly-supervised framework that ensures accurate IHC staining patterns while preserving H&E morphology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tumor spatial heterogeneity analysis requires accurate alignment and correlation of H&E morphology with IHC biomarker expression, but conventional methods face challenges due to misalignment in consecutive sections.

Method: The paper proposes PRINTER, a framework integrating prototype-driven content decoupling, GapBridge cyclic registration-synthesis for structural alignment, and deformation-aware adversarial learning to achieve accurate virtual staining.

Result: PRINTER demonstrates superior performance in preserving H&E staining details and generating faithful virtual IHC staining patterns, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: PRINTER provides a robust and scalable solution for virtual staining, presenting a significant advancement in computational pathology.

Abstract: Tumor spatial heterogeneity analysis requires precise correlation between
Hematoxylin and Eosin H&E morphology and immunohistochemical (IHC) biomarker
expression, yet current methods suffer from spatial misalignment in consecutive
sections, severely compromising in situ pathological interpretation. In order
to obtain a more accurate virtual staining pattern, We propose PRINTER, a
weakly-supervised framework that integrates PRototype-drIven content and
staiNing patTERn decoupling and deformation-aware adversarial learning
strategies designed to accurately learn IHC staining patterns while preserving
H&E staining details. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) A
prototype-driven staining pattern transfer with explicit content-style
decoupling; and (2) A cyclic registration-synthesis framework GapBridge that
bridges H&E and IHC domains through deformable structural alignment, where
registered features guide cross-modal style transfer while synthesized outputs
iteratively refine the registration;(3) Deformation-Aware Adversarial Learning:
We propose a training framework where a generator and deformation-aware
registration network jointly adversarially optimize a style-focused
discriminator. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRINTER effectively
achieves superior performance in preserving H&E staining details and virtual
staining fidelity, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Our work provides a
robust and scalable solution for virtual staining, advancing the field of
computational pathology.

*Yuan Liu,Zhongyin Zhao,Le Tian,Haicheng Wang,Xubing Ye,Yangxiu You,Zilin Yu,Chuhan Wu,Xiao Zhou,Yang Yu,Jie Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel framework to automate the creation of high-quality document extraction datasets and models, improving model performance by training on synthetic and iteratively enhanced real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate document conversion models require high-quality labeled data, but manual annotation is costly, and existing automated labeling lacks precision for complex formats like tables and multi-column text.

Method: The framework consists of generating large-scale synthetic data for initial training, followed by a self-improvement approach where the model annotates real-world documents. Annotation quality is verified using filtering strategies, and the model is retrained iteratively to enhance performance.

Result: The proposed model, POINTS-Reader, achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming many public and proprietary models in document conversion accuracy.

Conclusion: This automated framework provides an effective distillation-free solution for document extraction, optimizing both the dataset creation process and the resulting model's capabilities.

Abstract: High-quality labeled data is essential for training accurate document
conversion models, particularly in domains with complex formats such as tables,
formulas, and multi-column text. However, manual annotation is both costly and
time-consuming, while automatic labeling using existing models often lacks
accuracy in handling such challenging scenarios. Consequently, training student
models by distilling outputs from teacher models can significantly limit their
performance in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a fully
automated, distillation-free framework comprising two stages for constructing
high-quality document extraction datasets and models capable of handling
diverse document formats and layouts. In the first stage, we introduce a method
for generating large-scale, diverse synthetic data, which enables a model to
extract key elements in a unified format with strong initial performance. In
the second stage, we present a self-improvement approach that further adapts
the model, initially trained on synthetic data, to real-world documents.
Specifically, we first use the fine-tuned model to annotate real documents,
then apply a suite of filtering strategies to verify annotation quality, and
finally retrain the model on the verified dataset. By iteratively repeating
this process, we progressively enhance both the model's conversion capabilities
and the quality of the generated data. We train a public POINTS-1.5 model to
obtain POINTS-Reader, which surpasses many existing public and proprietary
models of comparable or larger size. Our model is available at
https://github.com/Tencent/POINTS-Reader.

TL;DR: FantasyHSI addresses Human-Scene Interaction challenges in generating realistic human behaviors in complex environments, introducing a multi-agent system and novel feedback mechanisms for improved results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HSI struggles with long-horizon tasks and generalization to unseen scenes. This paper aims to overcome these limitations using novel methods.

Method: FantasyHSI employs a dynamic directed graph, a collaborative multi-agent system (scene navigator, planning agent, critic agent), and Direct Preference Optimization to enhance realism and consistency.

Result: FantasyHSI outperformed existing methods in generalization, long-horizon task completion, and physical realism, as tested on the custom SceneBench benchmark.

Conclusion: This framework offers a robust solution for realistic and logical human-scene interactions by integrating innovative planning, feedback, and optimization mechanisms.

Abstract: Human-Scene Interaction (HSI) seeks to generate realistic human behaviors
within complex environments, yet it faces significant challenges in handling
long-horizon, high-level tasks and generalizing to unseen scenes. To address
these limitations, we introduce FantasyHSI, a novel HSI framework centered on
video generation and multi-agent systems that operates without paired data. We
model the complex interaction process as a dynamic directed graph, upon which
we build a collaborative multi-agent system. This system comprises a scene
navigator agent for environmental perception and high-level path planning, and
a planning agent that decomposes long-horizon goals into atomic actions.
Critically, we introduce a critic agent that establishes a closed-loop feedback
mechanism by evaluating the deviation between generated actions and the planned
path. This allows for the dynamic correction of trajectory drifts caused by the
stochasticity of the generative model, thereby ensuring long-term logical
consistency. To enhance the physical realism of the generated motions, we
leverage Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to train the action generator,
significantly reducing artifacts such as limb distortion and foot-sliding.
Extensive experiments on our custom SceneBench benchmark demonstrate that
FantasyHSI significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of
generalization, long-horizon task completion, and physical realism. Ours

Motivation: To address the challenge of understanding complex object detection architectures, particularly RT-DETRv2, which lacks clarity in how its components are integrated.

Method: The authors provide eight carefully crafted illustrations to visually and conceptually break down the RT-DETRv2 architecture, detailing the flow of tensors and the functionality of key modules.

Conclusion: The paper successfully bridges the knowledge gap in understanding RT-DETRv2 by demystifying its inner workings, making it more accessible to the research community.

Abstract: Object detection architectures are notoriously difficult to understand, often
more so than large language models. While RT-DETRv2 represents an important
advance in real-time detection, most existing diagrams do little to clarify how
its components actually work and fit together. In this article, we explain the
architecture of RT-DETRv2 through a series of eight carefully designed
illustrations, moving from the overall pipeline down to critical components
such as the encoder, decoder, and multi-scale deformable attention. Our goal is
to make the existing one genuinely understandable. By visualizing the flow of

researchers and practitioners with a clearer mental model of how RT-DETRv2
works under the hood.

*Lee Chae-Yeon,Nam Hyeon-Woo,Tae-Hyun Oh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses 3D hand pose estimation challenges by introducing aleatoric uncertainty modeling with a novel linear layer parameterization to improve accuracy and joint correlation modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the limitations of 3D hand pose estimation caused by hand movement, self-similarity, and frequent occlusions, and to incorporate joint correlation knowledge into uncertainty modeling, which existing methods lack.

Method: The method involves introducing aleatoric uncertainty into the framework and utilizing a novel task head layer with a single linear layer that models joint correlations by treating hand joint output as a probabilistic distribution. This add-on module is compatible with existing models.

Result: Experiments show the proposed parameterization improves over existing uncertainty modeling approaches and enhances 3D hand pose estimation accuracy while introducing uncertainty modeling capability.

Conclusion: The novel parameterization offers an effective way to model joint correlations and aleatoric uncertainty, resulting in better accuracy and advancing 3D hand pose estimation frameworks.

Abstract: 3D hand pose estimation is a fundamental task in understanding human hands.
However, accurately estimating 3D hand poses remains challenging due to the
complex movement of hands, self-similarity, and frequent occlusions. In this
work, we address two limitations: the inability of existing 3D hand pose
estimation methods to estimate aleatoric (data) uncertainty, and the lack of
uncertainty modeling that incorporates joint correlation knowledge, which has
not been thoroughly investigated. To this end, we introduce aleatoric
uncertainty modeling into the 3D hand pose estimation framework, aiming to
achieve a better trade-off between modeling joint correlations and
computational efficiency. We propose a novel parameterization that leverages a
single linear layer to capture intrinsic correlations among hand joints. This
is enabled by formulating the hand joint output space as a probabilistic
distribution, allowing the linear layer to capture joint correlations. Our
proposed parameterization is used as a task head layer, and can be applied as
an add-on module on top of the existing models. Our experiments demonstrate
that our parameterization for uncertainty modeling outperforms existing
approaches. Furthermore, the 3D hand pose estimation model equipped with our
uncertainty head achieves favorable accuracy in 3D hand pose estimation while
introducing new uncertainty modeling capability to the model. The project page

### [349] [Towards More Diverse and Challenging Pre-training for Point Cloud Learning: Self-Supervised Cross Reconstruction with Decoupled Views](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01250)
*Xiangdong Zhang,Shaofeng Zhang,Junchi Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Point-PQAE, a two-view point cloud learning approach for self-supervised learning that outperforms previous single-view methods by incorporating cross-reconstruction between decoupled views.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing self-supervised point cloud methods that rely on single-view reconstruction, and to leverage the diversity and challenges introduced by a two-view pre-training paradigm.

Method: The authors propose Point-PQAE, which generates two decoupled point cloud views via a crop mechanism, applies a novel positional encoding for 3D relative positions, and enables cross-reconstruction between the views for higher pre-training complexity.

Result: Point-PQAE surpasses the single-view baseline (Point-MAE) in performance, achieving improvements of 6.5%, 7.0%, and 6.7% across various ScanObjectNN benchmarks with Mlp-Linear evaluation.

Conclusion: By introducing a two-view cross-reconstruction paradigm and novel techniques like cropped view generation and positional encoding, Point-PQAE demonstrates a significant advancement in self-supervised point cloud learning.

Abstract: Point cloud learning, especially in a self-supervised way without manual
labels, has gained growing attention in both vision and learning communities
due to its potential utility in a wide range of applications. Most existing
generative approaches for point cloud self-supervised learning focus on
recovering masked points from visible ones within a single view. Recognizing
that a two-view pre-training paradigm inherently introduces greater diversity
and variance, it may thus enable more challenging and informative pre-training.
Inspired by this, we explore the potential of two-view learning in this domain.
In this paper, we propose Point-PQAE, a cross-reconstruction generative
paradigm that first generates two decoupled point clouds/views and then
reconstructs one from the other. To achieve this goal, we develop a crop
mechanism for point cloud view generation for the first time and further
propose a novel positional encoding to represent the 3D relative position
between the two decoupled views. The cross-reconstruction significantly
increases the difficulty of pre-training compared to self-reconstruction, which
enables our method to surpass previous single-modal self-reconstruction methods
in 3D self-supervised learning. Specifically, it outperforms the
self-reconstruction baseline (Point-MAE) by 6.5%, 7.0%, and 6.7% in three
variants of ScanObjectNN with the Mlp-Linear evaluation protocol. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitation of vision-language models that fail to provide narrative and context-rich captions, crucial for applications like news reporting and digital archiving.

Method: ReCap utilizes a novel pipeline including: (1) a two-stage article retrieval system using DINOv2 embeddings for candidate selection and re-ranking via patch similarity, (2) a context extraction module synthesizing article summaries and metadata, and (3) a caption generation system enhanced with Semantic Gaussian Normalization.

Result: ReCap secured a strong performance on the OpenEvents V1 dataset, achieving an overall score of 0.54666 and ranking 2nd in the EVENTA 2025 Grand Challenge private test set.

Conclusion: ReCap effectively bridges image perception and real-world contextual understanding, demonstrating its utility in generating detailed, context-aware captions for diverse high-stakes applications.

Abstract: Image captioning systems often produce generic descriptions that fail to
capture event-level semantics which are crucial for applications like news
reporting and digital archiving. We present ReCap, a novel pipeline for
event-enriched image retrieval and captioning that incorporates broader
contextual information from relevant articles to generate narrative-rich,
factually grounded captions. Our approach addresses the limitations of standard
vision-language models that typically focus on visible content while missing
temporal, social, and historical contexts. ReCap comprises three integrated
components: (1) a robust two-stage article retrieval system using DINOv2
embeddings with global feature similarity for initial candidate selection
followed by patch-level mutual nearest neighbor similarity re-ranking; (2) a
context extraction framework that synthesizes information from article
summaries, generic captions, and original source metadata; and (3) a large
language model-based caption generation system with Semantic Gaussian
Normalization to enhance fluency and relevance. Evaluated on the OpenEvents V1
dataset as part of Track 1 in the EVENTA 2025 Grand Challenge, ReCap achieved a
strong overall score of 0.54666, ranking 2nd on the private test set. These
results highlight ReCap's effectiveness in bridging visual perception with

TL;DR: The paper introduces X-Agent, a framework improving open-vocabulary semantic segmentation by optimizing latent semantic dynamics in vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation faces challenges due to domain discrepancies and difficulty in modeling unseen latent categories, requiring better latent semantic understanding.

Method: The authors conducted experiments to analyze latent semantics in vision-language models and proposed X-Agent, which employs latent semantic-aware agents to enhance cross-modal attention and semantic dynamics.

Result: X-Agent demonstrated state-of-the-art results in benchmark evaluations while improving the saliency of latent semantics.

Conclusion: The research advances understanding and modeling of latent semantics in open-vocabulary settings, providing robust performance through innovative framework design.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) conducts pixel-level
classification via text-driven alignment, where the domain discrepancy between
base category training and open-vocabulary inference poses challenges in
discriminative modeling of latent unseen category. To address this challenge,
existing vision-language model (VLM)-based approaches demonstrate commendable
performance through pre-trained multi-modal representations. However, the
fundamental mechanisms of latent semantic comprehension remain underexplored,
making the bottleneck for OVSS. In this work, we initiate a probing experiment
to explore distribution patterns and dynamics of latent semantics in VLMs under
inductive learning paradigms. Building on these insights, we propose X-Agent,
an innovative OVSS framework employing latent semantic-aware ``agent'' to
orchestrate cross-modal attention mechanisms, simultaneously optimizing latent
semantic dynamic and amplifying its perceptibility. Extensive benchmark
evaluations demonstrate that X-Agent achieves state-of-the-art performance
while effectively enhancing the latent semantic saliency.

Conclusion: This study is the first to introduce NAS to SAR object detection, paving the way for more efficient and accurate real-world solutions.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) object detection faces significant challenges
from speckle noise, small target ambiguities, and on-board computational
constraints. While existing approaches predominantly focus on SAR-specific
architectural modifications, this paper explores the application of the
existing lightweight object detector, i.e., YOLOv10, for SAR object detection
and enhances its performance through Neural Architecture Search (NAS).
Specifically, we employ NAS to systematically optimize the network structure,
especially focusing on the backbone architecture search. By constructing an
extensive search space and leveraging evolutionary search, our method
identifies a favorable architecture that balances accuracy, parameter
efficiency, and computational cost. Notably, this work introduces NAS to SAR
object detection for the first time. The experimental results on the

Result: The model demonstrated a strong accuracy-efficiency trade-off and achieved new state-of-the-art results with mAP@50 of 71.9 on RADDet and 57.1 on CARRADA datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method is both highly efficient and accurate for radar-based object detection, surpassing existing benchmarks.

Abstract: Detecting objects efficiently from radar sensors has recently become a
popular trend due to their robustness against adverse lighting and weather
conditions compared with cameras. This paper presents an efficient object
detection model for Range-Doppler (RD) radar maps. Specifically, we first
represent RD radar maps with multi-representation, i.e., heatmaps and grayscale
images, to gather high-level object and fine-grained texture features. Then, we
design an additional Adapter branch, an Exchanger Module with two modes, and a
Primary-Auxiliary Fusion Module to effectively extract, exchange, and fuse
features from the multi-representation inputs, respectively. Furthermore, we
construct a supernet with various width and fusion operations in the Adapter
branch for the proposed model and employ a One-Shot Neural Architecture Search
method to further improve the model's efficiency while maintaining high
performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our model obtains favorable
accuracy and efficiency trade-off. Moreover, we achieve new state-of-the-art

*Huan Ni,Qingshan Liu,Xiaonan Niu,Danfeng Hong,Lingli Zhao,Haiyan Guan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in cross-domain few-shot segmentation (CD-FSS) by proposing a unified method using ordinary differential equations and Fourier transform to enhance generalization and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the limitation of existing CD-FSS methods, which rely on multiple independent modules that hinder effective knowledge sharing and fail to fully exploit their collective potential.

Method: The proposed Few-Shot Segmentation over Time Intervals (FSS-TIs) method utilizes an ODE-based formulation applied to the spectra of domain-specific and domain-agnostic features, enabling iterative transformation and simulation of diverse target-domain distributions through optimized intrinsic parameters.

Result: FSS-TIs demonstrate superiority in performance over existing methods, validated across five diverse datasets and two sets of cross-domain tasks, with strong evidence of cross-domain adaptability.

Conclusion: The study introduces a structurally concise and effective approach for improving CD-FSS by unifying feature transformation processes, offering better generalization and real-world applicability.

Abstract: Cross-domain few-shot segmentation (CD-FSS) not only enables the segmentation
of unseen categories with very limited samples, but also improves cross-domain
generalization ability within the few-shot segmentation framework. Currently,
existing CD-FSS studies typically design multiple independent modules to
enhance the cross-domain generalization ability of feature representations.
However, the independence among these modules hinders the effective flow of
knowledge, making it difficult to fully leverage their collective potential. In
contrast, this paper proposes an all-in-one module based on ordinary
differential equations and Fourier transform, resulting in a structurally
concise method--Few-Shot Segmentation over Time Intervals (FSS-TIs). FSS-TIs
assumes the existence of an ODE relationship between the spectra (including
amplitude and phase spectra) of domain-specific features and domain-agnostic
features. This ODE formulation yields an iterative transformation process along
a sequence of time intervals, while simultaneously applying affine
transformations with randomized perturbations to the spectra. In doing so, the
exploration of domain-agnostic feature representation spaces and the simulation
of diverse potential target-domain distributions are reformulated as an
optimization process over the intrinsic parameters of the ODE. Moreover, we
strictly constrain the support-sample selection during target-domain
fine-tuning so that it is consistent with the requirements of real-world
few-shot segmentation tasks. For evaluation, we introduce five datasets from
substantially different domains and define two sets of cross-domain few-shot
segmentation tasks to comprehensively analyze the performance of FSS-TIs.
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of FSS-TIs over existing
CD-FSS methods, and in-depth ablation studies further validate the cross-domain
adaptability of FSS-TIs.

*Alexandros Gkillas,Nikos Piperigkos,Aris S. Lalos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework that improves semantic segmentation of sparse LiDAR point clouds by integrating super-resolution (SR) techniques and joint optimization, offering performance comparable to high-cost sensors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR sensors with higher resolution are expensive, limiting their usage in autonomous driving. Lower-cost sensors produce sparse data, degrading segmentation accuracy, so a cost-effective solution is needed.

Method: The method integrates a lightweight SR architecture with semantic segmentation through joint optimization during training, involving a specialized SR loss function to enhance regions of interest.

Result: The system achieves segmentation results on par with high-resolution (64-channel) LiDAR models while using low-cost, sparse (16-channel) equipment.

Conclusion: Combining LiDAR SR and semantic segmentation in a unified framework provides a cost-effective and efficient way to enhance low-resolution LiDAR data for autonomous driving.

Abstract: High-resolution LiDAR data plays a critical role in 3D semantic segmentation
for autonomous driving, but the high cost of advanced sensors limits
large-scale deployment. In contrast, low-cost sensors such as 16-channel LiDAR
produce sparse point clouds that degrade segmentation accuracy. To overcome
this, we introduce the first end-to-end framework that jointly addresses LiDAR
super-resolution (SR) and semantic segmentation. The framework employs joint
optimization during training, allowing the SR module to incorporate semantic
cues and preserve fine details, particularly for smaller object classes. A new
SR loss function further directs the network to focus on regions of interest.
The proposed lightweight, model-based SR architecture uses significantly fewer
parameters than existing LiDAR SR approaches, while remaining easily compatible
with segmentation networks. Experiments show that our method achieves
segmentation performance comparable to models operating on high-resolution and
costly 64-channel LiDAR data.

Result: PGRD outperforms Bayesian, ensemble, Probabilistic U-Net, and standard diffusion methods in terms of Dice scores, NLL, and ECE metrics while maintaining practical sampling efficiency.

Conclusion: PGRD provides an effective and efficient approach to enhance segmentation performance and calibration in medical imaging through its diffusion-based framework.

Abstract: Ambiguity in medical image segmentation calls for models that capture full
conditional distributions rather than a single point estimate. We present
Prior-Guided Residual Diffusion (PGRD), a diffusion-based framework that learns
voxel-wise distributions while maintaining strong calibration and practical
sampling efficiency. PGRD embeds discrete labels as one-hot targets in a
continuous space to align segmentation with diffusion modeling. A coarse prior
predictor provides step-wise guidance; the diffusion network then learns the
residual to the prior, accelerating convergence and improving calibration. A
deep diffusion supervision scheme further stabilizes training by supervising
intermediate time steps. Evaluated on representative MRI and CT datasets, PGRD
achieves higher Dice scores and lower NLL/ECE values than Bayesian, ensemble,
Probabilistic U-Net, and vanilla diffusion baselines, while requiring fewer
sampling steps to reach strong performance.

*Yunus Serhat Bicakci,Joseph Shingleton,Anahid Basiri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a new method integrating multimodal large language models with retrieval-augmented generation for street-level image geolocalization, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy without expensive retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of smartphones and social media has made geolocalizing images a complex yet important task for applications such as navigation and urban planning, calling for scalable solutions.

Method: The approach combines multimodal large language models with retrieval-augmented generation, leveraging a vector database built with the SigLIP encoder on two large datasets to enhance geolocation estimation.

Result: The proposed method outperformed existing benchmarks and achieved state-of-the-art accuracy on datasets like IM2GPS, IM2GPS3k, and YFCC4k, without requiring fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The study showcases a scalable, effective geolocalization approach using retrieval-augmented generation and multimodal models, suggesting an accessible alternative to traditional methods requiring significant retraining.

Abstract: Street-level geolocalization from images is crucial for a wide range of
essential applications and services, such as navigation, location-based
recommendations, and urban planning. With the growing popularity of social
media data and cameras embedded in smartphones, applying traditional computer
vision techniques to localize images has become increasingly challenging, yet
highly valuable. This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates
open-weight and publicly accessible multimodal large language models with
retrieval-augmented generation. The method constructs a vector database using
the SigLIP encoder on two large-scale datasets (EMP-16 and OSV-5M). Query
images are augmented with prompts containing both similar and dissimilar
geolocation information retrieved from this database before being processed by
the multimodal large language models. Our approach has demonstrated
state-of-the-art performance, achieving higher accuracy compared against three
widely used benchmark datasets (IM2GPS, IM2GPS3k, and YFCC4k). Importantly, our
solution eliminates the need for expensive fine-tuning or retraining and scales
seamlessly to incorporate new data sources. The effectiveness of
retrieval-augmented generation-based multimodal large language models in
geolocation estimation demonstrated by this paper suggests an alternative path
to the traditional methods which rely on the training models from scratch,
opening new possibilities for more accessible and scalable solutions in GeoAI.

TL;DR: AgroSense is a deep learning framework for real-time crop recommendation, integrating soil image classification and nutrient profiling to enhance precision agriculture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the inefficiency of traditional soil analysis techniques for real-time, on-field decision-making in sustainable farming.

Method: The framework includes two main modules: a Soil Classification Module using ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0, and Vision Transformer for soil image categorization, and a Crop Recommendation Module using models like Multi-Layer Perceptron, XGBoost, LightGBM, and TabNet to analyze structured soil data.

Conclusion: AgroSense is a scalable, practical solution for precision agriculture, enabling real-time decision-making and providing a foundation for future lightweight multimodal AI systems in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Meeting the increasing global demand for food security and sustainable
farming requires intelligent crop recommendation systems that operate in real
time. Traditional soil analysis techniques are often slow, labor-intensive, and
not suitable for on-field decision-making. To address these limitations, we
introduce AgroSense, a deep-learning framework that integrates soil image
classification and nutrient profiling to produce accurate and contextually
relevant crop recommendations. AgroSense comprises two main components: a Soil
Classification Module, which leverages ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0, and Vision
Transformer architectures to categorize soil types from images; and a Crop
Recommendation Module, which employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron, XGBoost,
LightGBM, and TabNet to analyze structured soil data, including nutrient
levels, pH, and rainfall. We curated a multimodal dataset of 10,000 paired
samples drawn from publicly available Kaggle repositories, approximately 50,000
soil images across seven classes, and 25,000 nutrient profiles for experimental
evaluation. The fused model achieves 98.0% accuracy, with a precision of 97.8%,
a recall of 97.7%, and an F1-score of 96.75%, while RMSE and MAE drop to 0.32
and 0.27, respectively. Ablation studies underscore the critical role of
multimodal coupling, and statistical validation via t-tests and ANOVA confirms
the significance of our improvements. AgroSense offers a practical, scalable
solution for real-time decision support in precision agriculture and paves the
way for future lightweight multimodal AI systems in resource-constrained
environments.

*Che Liu,Zheng Jiang,Chengyu Fang,Heng Guo,Yan-Jie Zhou,Jiaqi Qu,Le Lu,Minfeng Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces M3Ret, a unified visual encoder trained on a diverse medical image dataset, achieving state-of-the-art results in zero-shot retrieval for various modalities without modality-specific adjustments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the fragmented approach in medical image retrieval caused by modality-specific methods, seeking to build unified visual representations for diverse medical data.

Method: The authors curated a large hybrid-modality dataset and trained M3Ret using generative (MAE) and contrastive (SimDINO) self-supervised learning paradigms, without customization for specific modalities.

Result: M3Ret outperformed baselines in zero-shot retrieval across modalities, demonstrated cross-modal alignment without paired data, and generalized to unseen modalities, like MRI, despite limited pretraining exposure.

Conclusion: This research indicates that unified foundational models like M3Ret are viable for multimodal medical image understanding, marking progress in scalable and generalizable self-supervised learning for medical data.

Abstract: Medical image retrieval is essential for clinical decision-making and
translational research, relying on discriminative visual representations. Yet,
current methods remain fragmented, relying on separate architectures and
training strategies for 2D, 3D, and video-based medical data. This
modality-specific design hampers scalability and inhibits the development of
unified representations. To enable unified learning, we curate a large-scale
hybrid-modality dataset comprising 867,653 medical imaging samples, including
2D X-rays and ultrasounds, RGB endoscopy videos, and 3D CT scans. Leveraging
this dataset, we train M3Ret, a unified visual encoder without any
modality-specific customization. It successfully learns transferable
representations using both generative (MAE) and contrastive (SimDINO)
self-supervised learning (SSL) paradigms. Our approach sets a new
state-of-the-art in zero-shot image-to-image retrieval across all individual
modalities, surpassing strong baselines such as DINOv3 and the text-supervised
BMC-CLIP. More remarkably, strong cross-modal alignment emerges without paired
data, and the model generalizes to unseen MRI tasks, despite never observing
MRI during pretraining, demonstrating the generalizability of purely visual
self-supervision to unseen modalities. Comprehensive analyses further validate
the scalability of our framework across model and data sizes. These findings
deliver a promising signal to the medical imaging community, positioning M3Ret
as a step toward foundation models for visual SSL in multimodal medical image
understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces TPIGE, a framework for identity-preserving text-to-video generation, achieving state-of-the-art performance without requiring large-scale fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenges of data scarcity and high computational costs in fine-tuning large video diffusion models for identity-preserving text-to-video generation.

Method: The TPIGE framework consists of Face Aware Prompt Enhancement (using GPT-4 for facial detail prompts), Prompt Aware Reference Image Enhancement (refining images to align with prompts), and ID-Aware Spatiotemporal Guidance Enhancement (joint optimization of identity and video quality using unified gradients).

Result: The proposed TPIGE framework improves input quality and employs sampling guidance to achieve superior identity preservation and video quality. It outperforms previous methods and won the ACM Multimedia 2025 Identity-Preserving Video Generation Challenge.

Conclusion: By introducing a novel training-free approach to refine inputs and guide generation, the TPIGE framework achieves significant advancements in text-to-video generation, delivering state-of-the-art performance cost-effectively.

Abstract: Identity-preserving text-to-video (IPT2V) generation creates videos faithful
to both a reference subject image and a text prompt. While fine-tuning large
pretrained video diffusion models on ID-matched data achieves state-of-the-art
results on IPT2V, data scarcity and high tuning costs hinder broader
improvement. We thus introduce a Training-Free Prompt, Image, and Guidance
Enhancement (TPIGE) framework that bridges the semantic gap between the video
description and the reference image and design sampling guidance that enhances
identity preservation and video quality, achieving performance gains at minimal
cost.Specifically, we first propose Face Aware Prompt Enhancement, using GPT-4o
to enhance the text prompt with facial details derived from the reference
image. We then propose Prompt Aware Reference Image Enhancement, leveraging an
identity-preserving image generator to refine the reference image, rectifying
conflicts with the text prompt. The above mutual refinement significantly
improves input quality before video generation. Finally, we propose ID-Aware
Spatiotemporal Guidance Enhancement, utilizing unified gradients to optimize
identity preservation and video quality jointly during generation.Our method
outperforms prior work and is validated by automatic and human evaluations on a
1000 video test set, winning first place in the ACM Multimedia 2025
Identity-Preserving Video Generation Challenge, demonstrating state-of-the-art
performance and strong generality. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Uirapuru, a framework for edge-based real-time video analytics using high-resolution steerable cameras, addressing challenges posed by camera actuation dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution steerable cameras offer improved adaptability for intelligent services, yet existing video analytics methods focus primarily on static cameras, neglecting the dynamism introduced by pan-tilt-zoom movements.

Method: Uirapuru integrates adaptive frame tiling optimized for steerable camera dynamics and incorporates actuation-aware system design for real-time edge-based operation.

Result: Experiments on augmented PTZ datasets and real-world PTZ camera videos show up to 1.45x accuracy improvement or 4.53x inference speedup with comparable accuracy versus existing static camera systems.

Conclusion: Uirapuru successfully bridges the gap between static and steerable camera analytics, delivering superior efficiency and accuracy while maintaining real-time processing capabilities.

Abstract: Real-time video analytics on high-resolution cameras has become a popular
technology for various intelligent services like traffic control and crowd
monitoring. While extensive work has been done on improving analytics accuracy
with timing guarantees, virtually all of them target static viewpoint cameras.
In this paper, we present Uirapuru, a novel framework for real-time, edge-based
video analytics on high-resolution steerable cameras. The actuation performed
by those cameras brings significant dynamism to the scene, presenting a
critical challenge to existing popular approaches such as frame tiling. To
address this problem, Uirapuru incorporates a comprehensive understanding of
camera actuation into the system design paired with fast adaptive tiling at a
per-frame level. We evaluate Uirapuru on a high-resolution video dataset,
augmented by pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) movements typical for steerable cameras and on
real-world videos collected from an actual PTZ camera. Our experimental results
show that Uirapuru provides up to 1.45x improvement in accuracy while
respecting specified latency budgets or reaches up to 4.53x inference speedup
with on-par accuracy compared to state-of-the-art static camera approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in low-light UAV imagery by proposing a novel unsupervised dataset (U3D), a new efficiency metric (EEI), and an efficient enhancement framework (U3LIE), achieving state-of-the-art performance in real-time scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve UAV performance under low-light conditions, which current LIE methods fail to address effectively due to challenges like ultra-high resolution, non-uniform illumination, and deployment constraints.

Method: The authors developed U3D, the first unsupervised ultra-high resolution UAV dataset for LIE, introduced the Edge Efficiency Index (EEI) metric, and proposed U3LIE, a framework featuring Adaptive Pre-enhancement Augmentation and Luminance Interval Loss for training.

Result: U3LIE achieves state-of-the-art results in low-light UAV image enhancement, processing 4K images at 23.8 FPS on a single GPU, suitable for real-time deployment.

Conclusion: The paper offers a comprehensive solution—including a dataset, metric, and method—for improving UAV vision in low-light conditions, significantly advancing real-time, on-board deployment capabilities.

Abstract: Low light conditions significantly degrade Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)
performance in critical applications. Existing Low-light Image Enhancement
(LIE) methods struggle with the unique challenges of aerial imagery, including
Ultra-High Resolution (UHR), lack of paired data, severe non-uniform
illumination, and deployment constraints. To address these issues, we propose
three key contributions. First, we present U3D, the first unsupervised UHR UAV
dataset for LIE, with a unified evaluation toolkit. Second, we introduce the
Edge Efficiency Index (EEI), a novel metric balancing perceptual quality with
key deployment factors: speed, resolution, model complexity, and memory
footprint. Third, we develop U3LIE, an efficient framework with two
training-only designs-Adaptive Pre-enhancement Augmentation (APA) for input
normalization and a Luminance Interval Loss (L_int) for exposure control. U3LIE
achieves SOTA results, processing 4K images at 23.8 FPS on a single GPU, making
it ideal for real-time on-board deployment. In summary, these contributions
provide a holistic solution (dataset, metric, and method) for advancing robust
24/7 UAV vision. The code and datasets are available at

### [364] [Enhancing Partially Relevant Video Retrieval with Robust Alignment Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01383)
*Long Zhang,Peipei Song,Jianfeng Dong,Kun Li,Xun Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenges of Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR), introducing a framework called Robust Alignment Learning (RAL) that uses probabilistic modeling to manage data uncertainty and enhance cross-modal alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The main motivation is to tackle the limitations of existing methods in PRVR that struggle with data uncertainty caused by query ambiguity and partial video relevance.

Method: The authors propose the RAL framework, which uses multivariate Gaussian distributions for probabilistic modeling and introduces learnable confidence gates to handle the heterogeneous informativeness of query words.

Result: The RAL framework improves query-video alignment performance and effectively manages spurious semantic correlations by quantifying data uncertainty.

Conclusion: The RAL framework is a robust and versatile solution for PRVR, capable of integration with existing architectures and delivering superior results across various retrieval models.

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) aims to retrieve untrimmed videos
partially relevant to a given query. The core challenge lies in learning robust
query-video alignment against spurious semantic correlations arising from
inherent data uncertainty: 1) query ambiguity, where the query incompletely
characterizes the target video and often contains uninformative tokens, and 2)
partial video relevance, where abundant query-irrelevant segments introduce
contextual noise in cross-modal alignment. Existing methods often focus on
enhancing multi-scale clip representations and retrieving the most relevant
clip. However, the inherent data uncertainty in PRVR renders them vulnerable to
distractor videos with spurious similarities, leading to suboptimal
performance. To fill this research gap, we propose Robust Alignment Learning
(RAL) framework, which explicitly models the uncertainty in data. Key
innovations include: 1) we pioneer probabilistic modeling for PRVR by encoding
videos and queries as multivariate Gaussian distributions. This not only
quantifies data uncertainty but also enables proxy-level matching to capture
the variability in cross-modal correspondences; 2) we consider the
heterogeneous informativeness of query words and introduce learnable confidence
gates to dynamically weight similarity. As a plug-and-play solution, RAL can be
seamlessly integrated into the existing architectures. Extensive experiments
across diverse retrieval backbones demonstrate its effectiveness.

*Emmanouil Nikolakakis,Amine Ouasfi,Julie Digne,Razvan Marinescu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces RibPull, a methodology leveraging implicit occupancy fields for enhanced 3D ribcage modeling from CT scans, addressing challenges tied to voxel-based systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome resolution, topology, and sparsity issues in voxel-based 3D medical imaging by utilizing continuous implicit representations.

Method: The authors employ neural occupancy fields to encode 3D ribcage representations from CT scans, using Laplacian-based contraction for extracting medial axes.

Result: RibPull demonstrated efficacy on data from the RibSeg dataset by effectively representing ribcage geometry and enabling medial axis extraction.

Conclusion: Continuous implicit representations, as used in RibPull, are superior to voxel-based methods for handling sparse and noisy geometrical data in medical imaging.

Abstract: We present RibPull, a methodology that utilizes implicit occupancy fields to
bridge computational geometry and medical imaging. Implicit 3D representations
use continuous functions that handle sparse and noisy data more effectively
than discrete methods. While voxel grids are standard for medical imaging, they
suffer from resolution limitations, topological information loss, and
inefficient handling of sparsity. Coordinate functions preserve complex
geometrical information and represent a better solution for sparse data
representation, while allowing for further morphological operations. Implicit
scene representations enable neural networks to encode entire 3D scenes within
their weights. The result is a continuous function that can implicitly
compesate for sparse signals and infer further information about the 3D scene
by passing any combination of 3D coordinates as input to the model. In this
work, we use neural occupancy fields that predict whether a 3D point lies
inside or outside an object to represent CT-scanned ribcages. We also apply a
Laplacian-based contraction to extract the medial axis of the ribcage, thus
demonstrating a geometrical operation that benefits greatly from continuous
coordinate-based 3D scene representations versus voxel-based representations.
We evaluate our methodology on 20 medical scans from the RibSeg dataset, which
is itself an extension of the RibFrac dataset. We will release our code upon
publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The authors introduce Neural Scene Designer (NSD), a framework for photo-realistic scene editing that maintains stylistic consistency while adhering to semantic intent. Utilizing advanced diffusion models and style learning techniques, they provide a benchmark to evaluate these capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Maintaining aesthetic and stylistic consistency in image editing and inpainting, overlooked by existing methods, is key to improving cohesion and appeal.

Method: NSD utilizes an advanced diffusion model with dual cross-attention mechanisms for semantic and style processing. Additionally, a Progressive Self-style Representational Learning (PSRL) module enforces stylistic consistency via style contrastive loss.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate NSD's ability to maintain stylistic consistency and semantic alignment, outperforming competing algorithms based on metrics evaluated on a new benchmark.

Conclusion: NSD successfully addresses and improves stylistic consistency preservation in image editing, setting a new standard through innovative mechanisms and evaluation protocols.

Abstract: Maintaining stylistic consistency is crucial for the cohesion and aesthetic
appeal of images, a fundamental requirement in effective image editing and
inpainting. However, existing methods primarily focus on the semantic control
of generated content, often neglecting the critical task of preserving this
consistency. In this work, we introduce the Neural Scene Designer (NSD), a
novel framework that enables photo-realistic manipulation of user-specified
scene regions while ensuring both semantic alignment with user intent and
stylistic consistency with the surrounding environment. NSD leverages an
advanced diffusion model, incorporating two parallel cross-attention mechanisms
that separately process text and style information to achieve the dual
objectives of semantic control and style consistency. To capture fine-grained
style representations, we propose the Progressive Self-style Representational
Learning (PSRL) module. This module is predicated on the intuitive premise that
different regions within a single image share a consistent style, whereas
regions from different images exhibit distinct styles. The PSRL module employs
a style contrastive loss that encourages high similarity between
representations from the same image while enforcing dissimilarity between those
from different images. Furthermore, to address the lack of standardized
evaluation protocols for this task, we establish a comprehensive benchmark.
This benchmark includes competing algorithms, dedicated style-related metrics,
and diverse datasets and settings to facilitate fair comparisons. Extensive
experiments conducted on our benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed framework.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MILO is a lightweight, multiscale metric for full-reference image quality assessment (FR-IQA), outperforming existing metrics and aiding perceptual optimization tasks like denoising and super-resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an accurate and efficient image quality assessment method without heavily relying on large-scale human-labeled datasets, and to utilize it for perceptual optimization in generative processes.

Method: MILO uses pseudo-Mean Opinion Score (MOS) supervision by applying reproducible distortions and training with ensemble scoring from recent quality metrics, accounting for visual masking effects. It incorporates spatial masking and curriculum learning strategies.

Result: MILO surpasses performance benchmarks of existing FR-IQA metrics, supports real-time applications, and enhances optimization tasks such as denoising and super-resolution by focusing on perceptually relevant distortions.

Conclusion: MILO is not just an advanced FR-IQA metric but also a practical tool for perceptually aligned optimization in image and latent spaces, offering both high accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: We present MILO (Metric for Image- and Latent-space Optimization), a
lightweight, multiscale, perceptual metric for full-reference image quality
assessment (FR-IQA). MILO is trained using pseudo-MOS (Mean Opinion Score)
supervision, in which reproducible distortions are applied to diverse images
and scored via an ensemble of recent quality metrics that account for visual
masking effects. This approach enables accurate learning without requiring
large-scale human-labeled datasets. Despite its compact architecture, MILO
outperforms existing metrics across standard FR-IQA benchmarks and offers fast
inference suitable for real-time applications. Beyond quality prediction, we
demonstrate the utility of MILO as a perceptual loss in both image and latent
domains. In particular, we show that spatial masking modeled by MILO, when
applied to latent representations from a VAE encoder within Stable Diffusion,
enables efficient and perceptually aligned optimization. By combining spatial
masking with a curriculum learning strategy, we first process perceptually less
relevant regions before progressively shifting the optimization to more
visually distorted areas. This strategy leads to significantly improved
performance in tasks like denoising, super-resolution, and face restoration,
while also reducing computational overhead. MILO thus functions as both a
state-of-the-art image quality metric and as a practical tool for perceptual
optimization in generative pipelines.

*Aparup Dhar,MD Tamim Hossain,Pritom Barua*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper develops an advanced calorie estimation method targeting Bangladeshi street food using an improved YOLOv8 model, achieving high accuracy in calorie calculation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from rising obesity rates and limitations of existing calorie tracking methods, especially their inadequacy for non-Western cuisines, such as Bangladeshi street food.

Method: The researchers constructed a dataset of Bangladeshi street foods and modified the YOLOv8 vision model for improved classification and segmentation, combining it with a regression model for calorie estimation.

Result: Their system achieved impressive metrics: 6.94 MAE, 11.03 RMSE, and a 96.0% R^2 score, demonstrating its accuracy and effectiveness.

Conclusion: This tailored system offers an efficient solution for real-world calorie tracking, providing precise results with minimal additional computational costs compared to existing models.

Abstract: As obesity rates continue to increase, automated calorie tracking has become
a vital tool for people seeking to maintain a healthy lifestyle or adhere to a
diet plan. Although numerous research efforts have addressed this issue,
existing approaches often face key limitations, such as providing only constant
caloric output, struggling with multiple food recognition challenges,
challenges in image scaling and normalization, and a predominant focus on
Western cuisines. In this paper, we propose a tailored solution that
specifically targets Bangladeshi street food. We first construct a diverse
dataset of popular street foods found across Bangladesh. Then, we develop a
refined calorie estimation system by modifying the state-of-the-art vision
model YOLOv8. Our modified model achieves superior classification and
segmentation results, with only a slight increase in computational complexity
compared to the base variant. Coupled with a machine learning regression model,
our system achieves an impressive 6.94 mean absolute error (MAE), 11.03 root
mean squared error (RMSE), and a 96.0% R^2 score in calorie estimation, making
it both highly effective and accurate for real-world food calorie calculations.

*Guohui Zhang,Jiangtong Tan,Linjiang Huang,Zhonghang Yuan,Naishan Zheng,Jie Huang,Feng Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diffusion models struggle with generating images at variable scales due to challenges in handling information across resolutions. InfoScale proposes solutions addressing these challenges to improve variable-scale image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models excel at visual generation but falter when generating images at resolutions different from their training scale due to issues in handling resolution-dependent information.

Method: InfoScale introduces three modules: Progressive Frequency Compensation (handles high-frequency loss in higher-resolution images), Adaptive Information Aggregation (balances local and global information across scales), and Noise Adaptation (redistributes initial noise for variable-scale generation).

Result: InfoScale effectively resolves issues of information loss, aggregation inflexibility, and noise misalignment, leading to improved variable-scaled image generation performance for diffusion models.

Conclusion: InfoScale enhances diffusion models for variable-scale generation and is plug-and-play, demonstrating strong experimental effectiveness across varying resolutions.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have become dominant in visual generation but suffer
performance drop when tested on resolutions that differ from the training
scale, whether lower or higher. In fact, the key challenge in generating
variable-scale images lies in the differing amounts of information across
resolutions, which requires information conversion procedures to be varied for
generating variable-scaled images. In this paper, we investigate the issues of
three critical aspects in DMs for a unified analysis in variable-scaled
generation: dilated convolution, attention mechanisms, and initial noise.
Specifically, 1) dilated convolution in DMs for the higher-resolution
generation loses high-frequency information. 2) Attention for variable-scaled
image generation struggles to adjust the information aggregation adaptively. 3)
The spatial distribution of information in the initial noise is misaligned with
variable-scaled image. To solve the above problems, we propose
\textbf{InfoScale}, an information-centric framework for variable-scaled image
generation by effectively utilizing information from three aspects
correspondingly. For information loss in 1), we introduce Progressive Frequency
Compensation module to compensate for high-frequency information lost by
dilated convolution in higher-resolution generation. For information
aggregation inflexibility in 2), we introduce Adaptive Information Aggregation
module to adaptively aggregate information in lower-resolution generation and
achieve an effective balance between local and global information in
higher-resolution generation. For information distribution misalignment in 3),
we design Noise Adaptation module to re-distribute information in initial noise
for variable-scaled generation. Our method is plug-and-play for DMs and
extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness in variable-scaled image

*Djamel Eddine Boukhari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Mamba-CNN, a hybrid architecture for efficiently assessing facial attractiveness, achieving state-of-the-art results on SCUT-FBP5500.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional architectures for facial attractiveness assessment either lack global context modeling or incur high computational costs. The paper aims to resolve this trade-off.

Method: The authors propose Mamba-CNN, which combines a hierarchical convolutional backbone with a lightweight SSM-inspired gating mechanism to dynamically focus on significant facial features and their spatial relationships.

Result: On the SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark, Mamba-CNN achieved superior performance: Pearson Correlation of 0.9187, MAE of 0.2022, and RMSE of 0.2610.

Conclusion: Mamba-CNN demonstrates that combining CNNs with SSMs can effectively enhance nuanced visual tasks while maintaining computational efficiency, setting a new architectural standard.

Abstract: The computational assessment of facial attractiveness, a challenging
subjective regression task, is dominated by architectures with a critical
trade-off: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) offer efficiency but have
limited receptive fields, while Vision Transformers (ViTs) model global context
at a quadratic computational cost. To address this, we propose Mamba-CNN, a
novel and efficient hybrid architecture. Mamba-CNN integrates a lightweight,
Mamba-inspired State Space Model (SSM) gating mechanism into a hierarchical
convolutional backbone. This core innovation allows the network to dynamically
modulate feature maps and selectively emphasize salient facial features and
their long-range spatial relationships, mirroring human holistic perception
while maintaining computational efficiency. We conducted extensive experiments
on the widely-used SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark, where our model sets a new
state-of-the-art. Mamba-CNN achieves a Pearson Correlation (PC) of 0.9187, a
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.2022, and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of
0.2610. Our findings validate the synergistic potential of combining CNNs with
selective SSMs and present a powerful new architectural paradigm for nuanced
visual understanding tasks.

*Artur Díaz-Juan,Coloma Ballester,Gloria Haro*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduced a new curated dataset and baseline model for soccer video summarization, achieving an F1 score of 0.3956.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To support video editors and improve automatic summary generation for sports highlights, addressing the lack of publicly available datasets.

Method: Developed a curated dataset with shot boundaries from 237 matches and proposed a baseline model using data sourced from SoccerNet.

Result: Generated benchmark dataset for soccer summarization tasks and designed a baseline achieving an F1 score of 0.3956.

Conclusion: The study provides resources for advancing sports video summarization, with a tailored dataset, baseline model, and novel evaluation metric.

Abstract: Video summarization aims to extract key shots from longer videos to produce
concise and informative summaries. One of its most common applications is in
sports, where highlight reels capture the most important moments of a game,
along with notable reactions and specific contextual events. Automatic summary
generation can support video editors in the sports media industry by reducing
the time and effort required to identify key segments. However, the lack of
publicly available datasets poses a challenge in developing robust models for
sports highlight generation. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing
a curated dataset for soccer video summarization, designed to serve as a
benchmark for the task. The dataset includes shot boundaries for 237 matches
from the Spanish, French, and Italian leagues, using broadcast footage sourced
from the SoccerNet dataset. Alongside the dataset, we propose a baseline model
specifically designed for this task, which achieves an F1 score of 0.3956 in
the test set. Furthermore, we propose a new metric constrained by the length of
each target summary, enabling a more objective evaluation of the generated
content. The dataset and code are available at

TL;DR: This paper examines the link between visual memorability and features in pretrained vision encoders, achieving superior performance with a sparse autoencoder loss on vision transformer representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and predict image memorability based on features from pretrained vision encoders.

Method: Analyzed latent activations, attention distributions, and uniformity of image patches in pretrained encoders; also applied sparsity-focused autoencoder loss over vision transformer representations.

Result: Identified features correlated with image memorability and improved results over previous methods using convolutional neural networks.

Conclusion: Some internal model features are effective predictors of human-perceived memorability.

Abstract: Images vary in how memorable they are to humans. Inspired by findings from
cognitive science and computer vision, this paper explores the correlates of
image memorability in pretrained vision encoders, focusing on latent
activations, attention distributions, and the uniformity of image patches. We
find that these features correlate with memorability to some extent.
Additionally, we explore sparse autoencoder loss over the representations of
vision transformers as a proxy for memorability, which yields results
outperforming past methods using convolutional neural network representations.
Our results shed light on the relationship between model-internal features and
memorability. They show that some features are informative predictors of what
makes images memorable to humans.

*Vanessa Sklyarova,Egor Zakharov,Malte Prinzler,Giorgio Becherini,Michael J. Black,Justus Thies*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new method to reconstruct 3D hair geometry from a single image by combining learned hairstyle priors from synthetic and real data with Gaussian-splatting-based reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reconstructing realistic 3D hair from a single photograph is difficult due to hairstyle complexity, lack of ground truth data, and limitations of classical and prior methods using synthetic data.

Method: The authors train a transformer-based model on synthetic data to capture internal hair geometry, while introducing real data to model external hair structure. They combine this prior knowledge with a Gaussian-splatting technique for reconstruction.

Result: Their method surpasses existing reconstruction techniques in capturing detailed hair orientation, silhouette, and backside consistency, evidenced by qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively integrates real and synthetic data to achieve superior 3D hair reconstruction from single images, bridging gaps in accuracy and consistency.

Abstract: We present a novel approach for 3D hair reconstruction from single
photographs based on a global hair prior combined with local optimization.
Capturing strand-based hair geometry from single photographs is challenging due
to the variety and geometric complexity of hairstyles and the lack of ground
truth training data. Classical reconstruction methods like multi-view stereo
only reconstruct the visible hair strands, missing the inner structure of
hairstyles and hampering realistic hair simulation. To address this, existing
methods leverage hairstyle priors trained on synthetic data. Such data,
however, is limited in both quantity and quality since it requires manual work
from skilled artists to model the 3D hairstyles and create near-photorealistic
renderings. To address this, we propose a novel approach that uses both, real
and synthetic data to learn an effective hairstyle prior. Specifically, we
train a transformer-based prior model on synthetic data to obtain knowledge of
the internal hairstyle geometry and introduce real data in the learning process
to model the outer structure. This training scheme is able to model the visible
hair strands depicted in an input image, while preserving the general 3D
structure of hairstyles. We exploit this prior to create a
Gaussian-splatting-based reconstruction method that creates hairstyles from one
or more images. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons with existing
reconstruction pipelines demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance
of our method for capturing detailed hair orientation, overall silhouette, and
backside consistency. For additional results and code, please refer to

### [374] [PointSlice: Accurate and Efficient Slice-Based Representation for 3D Object Detection from Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01487)
*Liu Qifeng,Zhao Dawei,Dong Yabo,Xiao Liang,Wang Juan,Min Chen,Li Fuyang,Jiang Weizhong,Lu Dongming,Nie Yiming*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PointSlice introduces a novel method for 3D object detection in autonomous driving using horizontal slicing of point clouds into 2D batches, achieving high inference speed and competitive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D object detection methods either suffer from slow inference speeds or have lower accuracy, prompting the need for a method that balances both efficiency and precision.

Method: PointSlice converts 3D point clouds into 2D slices along the horizontal plane and uses a Slice Interaction Network to maintain vertical relationships for better object perception.

Result: PointSlice achieves faster inference (1.13x) and reduces model parameters by 0.79x compared to SAFDNet on the Waymo dataset, with a minor 1.2 mAPH accuracy reduction. It sets a state-of-the-art 66.74 mAP on the nuScenes dataset and performs competitively on the Argoverse 2 dataset.

Conclusion: PointSlice provides an efficient trade-off between inference speed and detection accuracy, making it a strong contender in 3D object detection for autonomous driving.

Abstract: 3D object detection from point clouds plays a critical role in autonomous
driving. Currently, the primary methods for point cloud processing are
voxel-based and pillarbased approaches. Voxel-based methods offer high accuracy
through fine-grained spatial segmentation but suffer from slower inference
speeds. Pillar-based methods enhance inference speed but still fall short of
voxel-based methods in accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a novel
point cloud processing method, PointSlice, which slices point clouds along the
horizontal plane and includes a dedicated detection network. The main
contributions of PointSlice are: (1) A new point cloud processing technique
that converts 3D point clouds into multiple sets of 2D (x-y) data slices. The
model only learns 2D data distributions, treating the 3D point cloud as
separate batches of 2D data, which reduces the number of model parameters and
enhances inference speed; (2) The introduction of a Slice Interaction Network
(SIN). To maintain vertical relationships across slices, we incorporate SIN
into the 2D backbone network, which improves the model's 3D object perception
capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PointSlice achieves high
detection accuracy and inference speed. On the Waymo dataset, PointSlice is
1.13x faster and has 0.79x fewer parameters than the state-of-the-art
voxel-based method (SAFDNet), with only a 1.2 mAPH accuracy reduction. On the
nuScenes dataset, we achieve a state-of-the-art detection result of 66.74 mAP.
On the Argoverse 2 dataset, PointSlice is 1.10x faster, with 0.66x fewer
parameters and a 1.0 mAP accuracy reduction. The code will be available at
https://github.com/qifeng22/PointSlice2.

TL;DR: This paper introduces ConTiCoM-3D, a novel method for fast and accurate 3D shape generation from point clouds using a continuous-time consistency model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for efficient and accurate 3D shape generation methods for robotics, AR/VR, and digital content creation, as current approaches often rely on slow, iterative processes or latent-space encodings.

Method: ConTiCoM-3D uses a time-conditioned neural network with a TrigFlow-inspired continuous noise schedule and Chamfer Distance-based geometric loss, operating entirely in continuous time without diffusion steps or teacher models.

Result: The method demonstrates efficient one- to two-step inference with high geometric fidelity and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in quality and efficiency on the ShapeNet benchmark.

Conclusion: ConTiCoM-3D is a scalable and practical framework for generating 3D shapes, offering superior quality and speed compared to existing models.

Abstract: Fast and accurate 3D shape generation from point clouds is essential for
applications in robotics, AR/VR, and digital content creation. We introduce
ConTiCoM-3D, a continuous-time consistency model that synthesizes 3D shapes
directly in point space, without discretized diffusion steps, pre-trained
teacher models, or latent-space encodings. The method integrates a
TrigFlow-inspired continuous noise schedule with a Chamfer Distance-based
geometric loss, enabling stable training on high-dimensional point sets while
avoiding expensive Jacobian-vector products. This design supports efficient
one- to two-step inference with high geometric fidelity. In contrast to
previous approaches that rely on iterative denoising or latent decoders,
ConTiCoM-3D employs a time-conditioned neural network operating entirely in
continuous time, thereby achieving fast generation. Experiments on the ShapeNet
benchmark show that ConTiCoM-3D matches or outperforms state-of-the-art
diffusion and latent consistency models in both quality and efficiency,
establishing it as a practical framework for scalable 3D shape generation.

*Chao Deng,Xiaosen Li,Xiao Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The nnUNet framework is enhanced with a Self-Adaptive Convolution Module to improve segmentation accuracy. The MSA2-Net model uses this module for better generalization and achieves high Dice scores on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: nnUNet fails to fine-tune internal hyperparameters, limiting its generalization ability in segmentation.

Method: Introduced a Self-Adaptive Convolution Module to dynamically adjust kernel sizes, incorporated into the MSConvBridge and MSADecoder components of MSA2-Net.

Result: Achieved Dice coefficient scores of 86.49%, 92.56%, 93.37%, and 92.98% on Synapse, ACDC, Kvasir, and ISIC2017 datasets.

Conclusion: MSA2-Net with the Self-Adaptive Convolution Module improves the robustness and precision of medical image segmentation across diverse datasets.

Abstract: The nnUNet segmentation framework adeptly adjusts most hyperparameters in
training scripts automatically, but it overlooks the tuning of internal
hyperparameters within the segmentation network itself, which constrains the
model's ability to generalize. Addressing this limitation, this study presents
a novel Self-Adaptive Convolution Module that dynamically adjusts the size of
the convolution kernels depending on the unique fingerprints of different
datasets. This adjustment enables the MSA2-Net, when equipped with this module,
to proficiently capture both global and local features within the feature maps.
Self-Adaptive Convolution Module is strategically integrated into two key
components of the MSA2-Net: the Multi-Scale Convolution Bridge and the
Multi-Scale Amalgamation Decoder. In the MSConvBridge, the module enhances the
ability to refine outputs from various stages of the CSWin Transformer during
the skip connections, effectively eliminating redundant data that could
potentially impair the decoder's performance. Simultaneously, the MSADecoder,
utilizing the module, excels in capturing detailed information of organs
varying in size during the decoding phase. This capability ensures that the
decoder's output closely reproduces the intricate details within the feature
maps, thus yielding highly accurate segmentation images. MSA2-Net, bolstered by
this advanced architecture, has demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving
Dice coefficient scores of 86.49\%, 92.56\%, 93.37\%, and 92.98\% on the
Synapse, ACDC, Kvasir, and Skin Lesion Segmentation (ISIC2017) datasets,
respectively. This underscores MSA2-Net's robustness and precision in medical
image segmentation tasks across various datasets.

*Junjie Chen,Xuyang Liu,Zichen Wen,Yiyu Wang,Siteng Huang,Honggang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces V$^2$Drop, a token compression framework improving computational efficiency for large vision-language models (LVLMs), aiding high-resolution tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs struggle with efficiency in processing high-resolution images and extensive video due to the substantial token counts, necessitating methods for token reduction.

Method: The paper identifies visual token variations as task-agnostic properties and proposes V$^2$Drop, which selectively removes tokens with minimal variation during inference.

Result: V$^2$Drop retains 94.0% and 98.6% of original model performance for image and video tasks while cutting inference latency by 31.5% and 74.2%, respectively.

Conclusion: Variation-aware token dropping improves computation efficiency without major performance compromise, with additional advantages in GPU memory usage when paired with efficient operators.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in multimodal understanding tasks. However, the increasing demand
for high-resolution image and long-video understanding results in substantial
token counts, leading to reduced inference efficiency. Token compression offers
a direct solution by reducing the number of tokens to be processed, thereby
improving computational efficiency. Through extensive analysis, we identify two
critical limitations in existing inner-LLM token compression methods:
positional bias and incompatibility with efficient operators, which hinder
their practical deployment for LVLM acceleration. This paper presents the first
approach from a token variation perspective, revealing that visual token
variations within LLMs exhibit task-agnostic properties. We propose
Variation-aware Vision Token Dropping (\textit{i.e.}, \textbf{V$^2$Drop}),
which progressively removes visual tokens with minimal variation during LVLM
inference, thereby enhancing computational efficiency. Extensive experiments
across multiple models and benchmarks demonstrate that our V$^2$Drop is able to
maintain \textbf{94.0\%} and \textbf{98.6\%} of the original model performance
for image and video understanding tasks respectively, while reducing LLM
generation latency by \textbf{31.5\%} and \textbf{74.2\%}. When combined with
efficient operators, V$^2$Drop further reduces GPU peak memory usage.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Uniferum, a volumetric vision-language model (VLM) for enhancing diagnostic radiology by integrating diverse 3D CT dataset annotations. It outperforms previous models and shows strong generalization, even in zero-shot settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for more discriminative and precise vision-language models (VLMs) for high-stakes environments like radiology, given the limitations in labeled 3D CT datasets and annotation heterogeneity.

Method: Uniferum unifies heterogeneous supervision signals from classification labels and segmentation masks within a single training framework, harmonizing diverse public 3D CT datasets with varied annotations.

Result: Uniferum achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 7% improvement in AUROC on the CT-RATE benchmark compared to baseline models, and robust out-of-distribution generalization, including zero-shot capabilities.

Conclusion: Uniferum demonstrates that integrating diverse annotations and body segmentation enhances VLM performance in radiology, paving the way for more clinically reliable and data-efficient models in 3D medical imaging.

Abstract: General-purpose vision-language models (VLMs) have emerged as promising tools
in radiology, offering zero-shot capabilities that mitigate the need for large
labeled datasets. However, in high-stakes domains like diagnostic radiology,
these models often lack the discriminative precision required for reliable
clinical use. This challenge is compounded by the scarcity and heterogeneity of
publicly available volumetric CT datasets, which vary widely in annotation
formats and granularity. To address these limitations, we introduce Uniferum, a
volumetric VLM that unifies diverse supervision signals, encoded in
classification labels and segmentation masks, into a single training framework.
By harmonizing three public 3D CT datasets with distinct annotations, Uniferum
achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving AUROC on the CT-RATE benchmark
by 7% compared to CLIP-based and conventional multi-label convolutional models.
The model demonstrates robust out-of-distribution generalization, with observed
evidence of unexpected zero-shot performance on the RAD-CHEST and INSPECT
datasets. Our results highlight the effectiveness of integrating heterogeneous
annotations and body segmentation to enhance model performance, setting a new
direction for clinically reliable, data-efficient VLMs in 3D medical imaging.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents HIFU-ILDiff, a deep learning model that removes high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU)-induced interference in ultrasound images in real-time, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of safe and precise real-time monitoring during HIFU treatments, which is hindered by HIFU-induced interference in ultrasound imaging.

Method: The authors developed the HIFU-ILDiff model, combining a Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to encode noisy images and a latent diffusion model to progressively remove interference in the latent space.

Result: HIFU-ILDiff outperformed the Notch Filter, with SSIM and PSNR improvements (0.796 and 23.780 versus 0.443 and 14.420, respectively) and achieved real-time processing at 15 frames per second versus 5 seconds per frame for the Notch Filter.

Conclusion: HIFU-ILDiff improves the precision and safety of HIFU-based treatments through real-time, interference-free ultrasound image reconstruction, demonstrating strong clinical application potential.

Abstract: High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) is a non-invasive therapeutic
technique widely used for treating various diseases. However, the success and
safety of HIFU treatments depend on real-time monitoring, which is often
hindered by interference when using ultrasound to guide HIFU treatment. To
address these challenges, we developed HIFU-ILDiff, a novel deep learning-based
approach leveraging latent diffusion models to suppress HIFU-induced
interference in ultrasound images. The HIFU-ILDiff model employs a Vector
Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to encode noisy ultrasound images
into a lower-dimensional latent space, followed by a latent diffusion model
that iteratively removes interference. The denoised latent vectors are then
decoded to reconstruct high-resolution, interference-free ultrasound images. We
constructed a comprehensive dataset comprising 18,872 image pairs from in vitro
phantoms, ex vivo tissues, and in vivo animal data across multiple imaging
modalities and HIFU power levels to train and evaluate the model. Experimental
results demonstrate that HIFU-ILDiff significantly outperforms the commonly
used Notch Filter method, achieving a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of
0.796 and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 23.780 compared to SSIM of 0.443
and PSNR of 14.420 for the Notch Filter under in vitro scenarios. Additionally,
HIFU-ILDiff achieves real-time processing at 15 frames per second, markedly
faster than the Notch Filter's 5 seconds per frame. These findings indicate
that HIFU-ILDiff is able to denoise HIFU interference in ultrasound guiding
images for real-time monitoring during HIFU therapy, which will greatly improve
the treatment precision in current clinical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve video understanding capabilities in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by overcoming issues of spatial resolution versus temporal coverage trade-offs.

Method: Keye-VL-1.5 employs a Slow-Fast video encoding strategy, a progressive four-stage pre-training to process longer videos, and a post-training pipeline for reasoning and preference alignment.

Result: Keye-VL-1.5 shows significant improvements in video understanding tasks while maintaining strong performance on general multimodal benchmarks.

Conclusion: The innovations in Keye-VL-1.5 make it an effective model for addressing fundamental challenges in video comprehension, providing advancements in MLLMs.

Abstract: In recent years, the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has
significantly advanced, extending their capabilities to multimodal tasks
through Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, video understanding
remains a challenging area due to the dynamic and information-dense nature of
videos. Existing models struggle with the trade-off between spatial resolution
and temporal coverage when processing video content. We present Keye-VL-1.5,
which addresses fundamental challenges in video comprehension through three key
innovations. First, we introduce a novel Slow-Fast video encoding strategy that
dynamically allocates computational resources based on inter-frame similarity,
processing key frames with significant visual changes at higher resolution
(Slow pathway) while handling relatively static frames with increased temporal
coverage at lower resolution (Fast pathway). Second, we implement a progressive
four-stage pre-training methodology that systematically extends the model's
context length from 8K to 128K tokens, enabling processing of longer videos and
more complex visual content. Third, we develop a comprehensive post-training
pipeline focusing on reasoning enhancement and human preference alignment,
incorporating a 5-step chain-of-thought data construction process, iterative
GSPO-based reinforcement learning with progressive prompt hinting for difficult
cases, and alignment training. Through extensive evaluation on public
benchmarks and rigorous internal human assessment, Keye-VL-1.5 demonstrates
significant improvements over existing models, particularly excelling in video
understanding tasks while maintaining competitive performance on general
multimodal benchmarks.

Motivation: The paper seeks to address the challenge of developing a SLAM system that works effectively across diverse camera setups without prior knowledge of camera intrinsics while simplifying complexity.

Method: The approach involves using a symmetric two-view association (STA) model for relative camera pose estimation and pointmaps regression, combined with a Sim(3) pose graph backend incorporating loop closures.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance in camera tracking and dense 3D reconstruction compared to state-of-the-art methods, with reduced model complexity.

Conclusion: ViSTA-SLAM proves to be a broadly applicable and efficient SLAM system that operates without camera intrinsics and achieves high performance in tracking and reconstruction tasks. It represents a significant advancement in SLAM technology.

Abstract: We present ViSTA-SLAM as a real-time monocular visual SLAM system that
operates without requiring camera intrinsics, making it broadly applicable
across diverse camera setups. At its core, the system employs a lightweight
symmetric two-view association (STA) model as the frontend, which
simultaneously estimates relative camera poses and regresses local pointmaps

Motivation: To simplify and enhance controllable video editing by addressing the challenge of precise manipulation with a unified control approach.

Method: Introduces O-DisCo, an object distortion control signal based on random and adaptive noise, alongside a copy-form preservation module for non-edited regions.

Result: Extensive experiments and evaluations show that O-DisCo-Edit outperforms state-of-the-art methods across video editing tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed system is a significant advancement in video editing, offering efficiency and superior performance in a unified framework.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently advanced video editing, yet controllable
editing remains challenging due to the need for precise manipulation of diverse

resources. To address this, we propose O-DisCo-Edit, a unified framework that
incorporates a novel object distortion control (O-DisCo). This signal, based on
random and adaptive noise, flexibly encapsulates a wide range of editing cues
within a single representation. Paired with a "copy-form" preservation module
for preserving non-edited regions, O-DisCo-Edit enables efficient,
high-fidelity editing through an effective training paradigm. Extensive
experiments and comprehensive human evaluations consistently demonstrate that
O-DisCo-Edit surpasses both specialized and multitask state-of-the-art methods
across various video editing tasks.

Result: Experiments show that applying Panel-of-Peers leads to an improvement in performance across fifteen benchmarks, increasing average scores from 48% to 57%.

Conclusion: Peer evaluations among LVLMs offer a scalable and effective alternative to self-supervised alignment, enhancing performance without requiring extensive human-curated datasets.

Abstract: Traditional alignment methods for Large Vision and Language Models (LVLMs)
primarily rely on human-curated preference data. Human-generated preference
data is costly; machine-generated preference data is limited in quality; and
self-supervised preference data often introduces hallucinations. To overcome
these limitations, we propose a novel Panel-of-Peers learning framework
inspired by collaborative learning among humans. This approach leverages a
panel of LVLMs, each evaluating and learning from their collective outputs
through an iterative self-improvement process. By simulating a peer review
system, our models generate, assess, and refine outputs in response to a
curated set of prompts, mimicking a classroom learning environment. We
demonstrate that this methodology enhances model performance without requiring
extensive human-labeled datasets. Our experiments show significant improvement
across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of peer evaluations as
a scalable alternative to self-supervised alignment. Notably, we show that
Panel-of-Peers increases the average score on fifteen benchmarks from 48% to
57%

### [384] [Q-Sched: Pushing the Boundaries of Few-Step Diffusion Models with Quantization-Aware Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01624)
*Natalia Frumkin,Diana Marculescu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Text-to-image diffusion models are expensive and computation-intensive. Q-Sched is proposed to reduce model size and improve efficiency by changing the diffusion scheduler instead of the model weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the high computational cost and inefficiency of text-to-image diffusion models that depend on large model backbones and require full-precision inference.

Method: Q-Sched modifies the diffusion model scheduler, not the model weights. It introduces the JAQ loss for quantization-aware pre-conditioning, using a reference-free and low-calibration process to optimize text-image compatibility and image quality.

Result: Q-Sched achieves a 4x reduction in model size and significantly improves performance metrics like FID compared to existing methods. It also demonstrates its utility in complementing few-step distillation.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that modifying sampling schedules can make diffusion models efficient without sacrificing quality. Q-Sched outperforms prior quantization and distillation methods, emphasizing its practical benefits.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models are computationally intensive, often requiring
dozens of forward passes through large transformer backbones. For instance,
Stable Diffusion XL generates high-quality images with 50 evaluations of a
2.6B-parameter model, an expensive process even for a single batch. Few-step
diffusion models reduce this cost to 2-8 denoising steps but still depend on
large, uncompressed U-Net or diffusion transformer backbones, which are often
too costly for full-precision inference without datacenter GPUs. These
requirements also limit existing post-training quantization methods that rely
on full-precision calibration. We introduce Q-Sched, a new paradigm for
post-training quantization that modifies the diffusion model scheduler rather
than model weights. By adjusting the few-step sampling trajectory, Q-Sched
achieves full-precision accuracy with a 4x reduction in model size. To learn
quantization-aware pre-conditioning coefficients, we propose the JAQ loss,
which combines text-image compatibility with an image quality metric for
fine-grained optimization. JAQ is reference-free and requires only a handful of
calibration prompts, avoiding full-precision inference during calibration.
Q-Sched delivers substantial gains: a 15.5% FID improvement over the FP16
4-step Latent Consistency Model and a 16.6% improvement over the FP16 8-step
Phased Consistency Model, showing that quantization and few-step distillation
are complementary for high-fidelity generation. A large-scale user study with
more than 80,000 annotations further confirms Q-Sched's effectiveness on both
FLUX.1[schnell] and SDXL-Turbo.

### [385] [OpenVision 2: A Family of Generative Pretrained Visual Encoders for Multimodal Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01644)
*Yanqing Liu,Xianhang Li,Letian Zhang,Zirui Wang,Zeyu Zheng,Yuyin Zhou,Cihang Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces OpenVision 2, a simplified multimodal vision-language model with improved training efficiency and comparable performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance training efficiency in multimodal vision-language models by simplifying architectural and loss designs.

Method: The text encoder is removed along with the contrastive loss, retaining only the captioning loss for generative training.

Result: OpenVision 2 achieves similar performance to its predecessor but reduces training time by 1.5x and memory usage by 1.8x, enabling scalability to over 1 billion parameters.

Conclusion: The simplified generative-only approach shows promise for future multimodal model development, emphasizing both efficiency and scalability.

Abstract: This paper provides a simplification on OpenVision's architecture and loss
design for enhancing its training efficiency. Following the prior
vision-language pretraining works CapPa and AIMv2, as well as modern multimodal
designs like LLaVA, our changes are straightforward: we remove the text encoder
(and therefore the contrastive loss), retaining only the captioning loss as a
purely generative training signal. We name this new version OpenVision 2. The
initial results are promising: despite this simplification, OpenVision 2
competitively matches the original model's performance on a broad set of
multimodal benchmarks while substantially cutting both training time and memory
consumption. For example, with ViT-L/14, it reduces training time by about 1.5x
(from 83h to 57h), and memory usage by about 1.8x (from 24.5GB to 13.8GB,
equivalently allowing the maximum batch size to grow from 2k to 8k). This
superior training efficiency also allows us to scale far beyond the largest
vision encoder used in OpenVision, reaching more than 1 billion parameters. We
hold a strong belief that this lightweight, generative-only paradigm is
compelling for future vision encoder development in multimodal foundation
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations in augmenting LLMs with vision models, such as expensive data generation, reliance on precise data filtering, and poor generalization.

Method: ReVPT uses a novel reinforcement learning algorithm (based on GRPO) to train multi-modal LLMs for reasoning with visual tools and conducting extensive testing on various benchmarks.

Result: ReVPT achieved state-of-the-art results on benchmarks like SAT, CV-Bench, BLINK, and MMStar, outperforming both supervised finetuning methods and text-based RL baselines.

Conclusion: ReVPT is a significant advance for enhancing LLMs in visual reasoning via RL, providing new insights into RL-based visual tool usage and yielding superior performance.

Abstract: Visual reasoning, a cornerstone of human intelligence, encompasses complex
perceptual and logical processes essential for solving diverse visual problems.
While advances in computer vision have produced powerful models for various
perceptual tasks, leveraging these for general visual reasoning remains
challenging. Prior work demonstrates that augmenting LLMs with vision models
via supervised finetuning improves performance, but faces key limitations such
as expensive data generation, reliance on careful data filtering, and poor
generalization. To address these issues, we propose ReVPT to enhance
multi-modal LLMs' abilities to reason about and use visual tools through
reinforcement learning. We introduce a novel RL algorithm based on GRPO,
designed to train models to reason with a suite of four visual tools. Through
extensive experiments, we show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on several perception-heavy benchmarks, including SAT, CV-Bench,
BLINK and MMStar, significantly outperforming the supervised and text-based RL
finetuning baselines. Notably, Our ReVPT-3B and ReVPT-7B outperform the
instruct models by 9.03% and 9.44% on CV-Bench. Finally, we bring to the
community new insights on RL-based visual tool-usage through extensive
ablations. Our code is available at https://github.com/ls-kelvin/REVPT.

Conclusion: GaussianGAN offers a robust solution for real-time, photorealistic avatar rendering with superior visual quality, overcoming the blurring limitations of prior methods.

Abstract: Photorealistic and controllable human avatars have gained popularity in the
research community thanks to rapid advances in neural rendering, providing fast
and realistic synthesis tools. However, a limitation of current solutions is
the presence of noticeable blurring. To solve this problem, we propose
GaussianGAN, an animatable avatar approach developed for photorealistic
rendering of people in real-time. We introduce a novel Gaussian splatting
densification strategy to build Gaussian points from the surface of cylindrical
structures around estimated skeletal limbs. Given the camera calibration, we
render an accurate semantic segmentation with our novel view segmentation
module. Finally, a UNet generator uses the rendered Gaussian splatting features
and the segmentation maps to create photorealistic digital avatars. Our method
runs in real-time with a rendering speed of 79 FPS. It outperforms previous
methods regarding visual perception and quality, achieving a state-of-the-art
results in terms of a pixel fidelity of 32.94db on the ZJU Mocap dataset and
33.39db on the Thuman4 dataset.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high dimensionality of multispectral images and challenges in multi-label classification tasks.

Method: A pipeline is presented with an optional PCA step to reduce data to three dimensions, followed by application to deep learning classifiers ResNet50 and DINOv2.

Result: The utility of PCA is found to vary significantly depending on the deep learning architecture and training strategies used for multi-label classification.

Conclusion: PCA's effectiveness for multispectral image classification is conditional, prompting further research into alternate approaches and self-supervised methods.

Abstract: This paper investigates the utility of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for
multi-label classification of multispectral images using ResNet50 and DINOv2,
acknowledging the high dimensionality of such data and the associated
processing challenges. Multi-label classification, where each image may belong
to multiple classes, adds further complexity to feature extraction. Our
pipeline includes an optional PCA step that reduces the data to three
dimensions before feeding it into a three-layer classifier. The findings
demonstrate that the effectiveness of PCA for multi-label multispectral image
classification depends strongly on the chosen deep learning architecture and
training strategy, opening avenues for future research into self-supervised
pre-training and alternative dimensionality reduction approaches.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the CNSCA model based on ConvNeXt with attention mechanisms for improved rock size classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The accurate classification of rock sizes is crucial in industries like geotechnical engineering and mining for operational efficiency and safety.

Method: The paper proposes a novel model, CNSCA, augmenting ConvNeXt with self-attention to capture spatial dependencies and channel attention to highlight vital feature channels.

Result: The CNSCA model outperforms baseline models in rock size classification by effectively capturing both fine-grained patterns and broader contextual features.

Conclusion: Enhancing ConvNeXt with self-attention and channel attention demonstrates significant improvements in fine-grained texture classification, making it suitable for applications involving natural textures like rocks.

Abstract: Accurate classification of rock sizes is a vital component in geotechnical
engineering, mining, and resource management, where precise estimation
influences operational efficiency and safety. In this paper, we propose an
enhanced deep learning model based on the ConvNeXt architecture, augmented with
both self-attention and channel attention mechanisms. Building upon the
foundation of ConvNext, our proposed model, termed CNSCA, introduces
self-attention to capture long-range spatial dependencies and channel attention
to emphasize informative feature channels. This hybrid design enables the model
to effectively capture both fine-grained local patterns and broader contextual
relationships within rock imagery, leading to improved classification accuracy
and robustness. We evaluate our model on a rock size classification dataset and
compare it against three strong baseline. The results demonstrate that the
incorporation of attention mechanisms significantly enhances the models
capability for fine-grained classification tasks involving natural textures
like rocks.

*Yu Shi,Shuyi Fan,Changsheng Fang,Shuo Han,Haodong Li,Li Zhou,Bahareh Morovati,Dayang Wang,Hengyong Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a two-stage diffusion framework for limited-angle cardiac CT reconstruction using clinical metadata to improve quality and reduce artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited-angle computed tomography (LACT) suffers from severe artifacts due to truncated projections, motivating the need for a reconstruction method that improves image fidelity while addressing ill-posedness.

Method: The proposed method includes a two-stage diffusion model: the first stage uses metadata-driven priors, and the second stage refines the priors with metadata and ensures physics-based data consistency using an ADMM module.

Result: The method demonstrated significant improvements in reconstruction quality, especially under severe angular truncation, outperforming metadata-free baselines in SSIM, PSNR, nMI, and PCC metrics.

Conclusion: Using structured clinical metadata enhances both image quality and efficiency in LACT, emphasizing its importance for future metadata-guided medical imaging frameworks.

Abstract: Limited-angle computed tomography (LACT) offers improved temporal resolution
and reduced radiation dose for cardiac imaging, but suffers from severe
artifacts due to truncated projections. To address the ill-posedness of LACT
reconstruction, we propose a two-stage diffusion framework guided by structured
clinical metadata. In the first stage, a transformer-based diffusion model
conditioned exclusively on metadata, including acquisition parameters, patient
demographics, and diagnostic impressions, generates coarse anatomical priors
from noise. The second stage further refines the images by integrating both the
coarse prior and metadata to produce high-fidelity results. Physics-based data
consistency is enforced at each sampling step in both stages using an
Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers module, ensuring alignment with the
measured projections. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real cardiac
CT datasets demonstrate that incorporating metadata significantly improves
reconstruction fidelity, particularly under severe angular truncation. Compared
to existing metadata-free baselines, our method achieves superior performance
in SSIM, PSNR, nMI, and PCC. Ablation studies confirm that different types of
metadata contribute complementary benefits, particularly diagnostic and
demographic priors under limited-angle conditions. These findings highlight the
dual role of clinical metadata in improving both reconstruction quality and
efficiency, supporting their integration into future metadata-guided medical
imaging frameworks.

demonstrate the efficacy of TransMatch, achieving 98.91% accuracy with minimal
loss, alongside high precision, recall, and F1-scores for multiple defect
classes. These findings underscore its robustness in accurately identifying
diverse defects, such as cracks, pinholes, holes, and spatter. TransMatch thus
represents a significant leap forward in additive manufacturing defect
detection, offering a practical and scalable solution for quality assurance and
reliability across a wide range of industrial applications.

*Yifan Lan,Xin Cai,Jun Cheng,Shan Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Balanced Information Bottleneck (BIB) approach and its variant, MBIB, to tackle class imbalance in long-tailed visual recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of long-tailed data distribution in real-world visual recognition using a novel representation learning technique.

Method: Develop BIB combining loss function re-balancing and self-distillation, and extend it to MBIB for multi-layer knowledge combination using information theory.

Result: BIB and MBIB demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on long-tailed datasets like CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist 2018.

Conclusion: The BIB approach and its enhanced MBIB variant effectively learn sufficient and balanced representations for long-tailed visual recognition, offering a robust training and classification strategy.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved significant success in various
applications with large-scale and balanced data. However, data in real-world
visual recognition are usually long-tailed, bringing challenges to efficient
training and deployment of DNNs. Information bottleneck (IB) is an elegant
approach for representation learning. In this paper, we propose a balanced
information bottleneck (BIB) approach, in which loss function re-balancing and
self-distillation techniques are integrated into the original IB network. BIB
is thus capable of learning a sufficient representation with essential
label-related information fully preserved for long-tailed visual recognition.
To further enhance the representation learning capability, we also propose a
novel structure of mixture of multiple balanced information bottlenecks (MBIB),
where different BIBs are responsible for combining knowledge from different
network layers. MBIB facilitates an end-to-end learning strategy that trains
representation and classification simultaneously from an information theory
perspective. We conduct experiments on commonly used long-tailed datasets,
including CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist 2018. Both BIB and MBIB
reach state-of-the-art performance for long-tailed visual recognition.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PractiLight presents a novel method for controlling lighting in generated images using foundational generative model understanding and lightweight regression techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Controlling light in generated images is complex, especially with challenges that span across the entire image and spectrum. Existing methods rely on domain-specific datasets, limiting generalization.

Method: PractiLight proposes leveraging self-attention layer token interactions to represent lighting relationships. It uses lightweight LoRA regressors to produce irradiance maps, incorporating desired lighting via Classifier Guidance during image generation.

Result: PractiLight achieves state-of-the-art quality and control in relighting tasks, demonstrating efficiency in parameters and training data across various image domains.

Conclusion: The work enables practical and general relighting by tapping into foundational knowledge, showcasing applicability and efficiency compared to existing solutions.

Abstract: Light control in generated images is a difficult task, posing specific
challenges, spanning over the entire image and frequency spectrum. Most
approaches tackle this problem by training on extensive yet domain-specific
datasets, limiting the inherent generalization and applicability of the
foundational backbones used. Instead, PractiLight is a practical approach,
effectively leveraging foundational understanding of recent generative models
for the task. Our key insight is that lighting relationships in an image are
similar in nature to token interaction in self-attention layers, and hence are
best represented there. Based on this and other analyses regarding the
importance of early diffusion iterations, PractiLight trains a lightweight LoRA
regressor to produce the direct irradiance map for a given image, using a small
set of training images. We then employ this regressor to incorporate the
desired lighting into the generation process of another image using Classifier
Guidance. This careful design generalizes well to diverse conditions and image
domains. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in terms of quality and
control with proven parameter and data efficiency compared to leading works
over a wide variety of scenes types. We hope this work affirms that image
lighting can feasibly be controlled by tapping into foundational knowledge,
enabling practical and general relighting.

TL;DR: The paper introduces LGDiST, a model for resolving gene expression dropouts in Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) data, achieving significant performance improvements over previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models for predicting spatially resolved gene expression from histopathology images face limitations due to data dropouts and reliance on external references, creating a need for a reference-free and robust solution.

Method: The authors developed LGDiST, a latent gene diffusion model for ST data dropout that leverages context genes and innovative latent spaces without relying on external datasets for alignment.

Result: LGDiST reduces the Mean Squared Error by 18% on 26 datasets compared to the previous state-of-the-art and enhances performance of other gene expression prediction methods by up to 10%.

Conclusion: LGDiST demonstrates the effectiveness of using context genes and latent spaces in accurately completing ST data, showcasing a robust architecture that avoids reliance on external references.

Abstract: Computer Vision has proven to be a powerful tool for analyzing Spatial
Transcriptomics (ST) data. However, current models that predict spatially
resolved gene expression from histopathology images suffer from significant
limitations due to data dropout. Most existing approaches rely on single-cell
RNA sequencing references, making them dependent on alignment quality and
external datasets while also risking batch effects and inherited dropout. In
this paper, we address these limitations by introducing LGDiST, the first
reference-free latent gene diffusion model for ST data dropout. We show that
LGDiST outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in gene expression completion,
with an average Mean Squared Error that is 18% lower across 26 datasets.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that completing ST data with LGDiST improves gene
expression prediction performance on six state-of-the-art methods up to 10% in
MSE. A key innovation of LGDiST is using context genes previously considered
uninformative to build a rich and biologically meaningful genetic latent space.
Our experiments show that removing key components of LGDiST, such as the
context genes, the ST latent space, and the neighbor conditioning, leads to
considerable drops in performance. These findings underscore that the full
architecture of LGDiST achieves substantially better performance than any of
its isolated components.

Motivation: The scarcity of labeled datasets and the high dimensionality of 3D data hinder the direct use of deep learning. Traditional methods such as SfM and SLAM fall short in unstructured scenarios, necessitating better approaches combining deep learning and classical geometry.

Method: The paper develops geometric deep learning methods, incorporating priors like depth information and equivariance, to improve tasks such as camera pose estimation, depth prediction, and 3D reconstruction.

Result: The research demonstrates improved effectiveness of these methods across applications including cultural heritage preservation and immersive VR/AR.

Conclusion: Integrating geometric constraints with deep learning models significantly enhances the accuracy and robustness of 3D data processing and representation.

Abstract: Modern deep learning developments create new opportunities for 3D mapping
technology, scene reconstruction pipelines, and virtual reality development.
Despite advances in 3D deep learning technology, direct training of deep
learning models on 3D data faces challenges due to the high dimensionality
inherent in 3D data and the scarcity of labeled datasets. Structure-from-motion
(SfM) and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) exhibit robust
performance when applied to structured indoor environments but often struggle
with ambiguous features in unstructured environments. These techniques often
struggle to generate detailed geometric representations effective for
downstream tasks such as rendering and semantic analysis. Current limitations
require the development of 3D representation methods that combine traditional
geometric techniques with deep learning capabilities to generate robust
geometry-aware deep learning models.
  The dissertation provides solutions to the fundamental challenges in 3D
vision by developing geometric deep learning methods tailored for essential
tasks such as camera pose estimation, point cloud registration, depth
prediction, and 3D reconstruction. The integration of geometric priors or
constraints, such as including depth information, surface normals, and
equivariance into deep learning models, enhances both the accuracy and
robustness of geometric representations. This study systematically investigates
key components of 3D vision, including camera pose estimation, point cloud
registration, depth estimation, and high-fidelity 3D reconstruction,
demonstrating their effectiveness across real-world applications such as
digital cultural heritage preservation and immersive VR/AR environments.

Abstract: Ongoing advancements in computer vision, particularly in pattern recognition
and scene classification, have enabled new applications in environmental
monitoring. Deep learning now offers non-contact methods for assessing water
quality and detecting contamination, both critical for disaster response and
public health protection. This work introduces HydroVision, a deep

water quality parameters including Chlorophyll-Alpha, Chlorophylls, Colored
Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM), Phycocyanins, Suspended Sediments, and
Turbidity from standard Red-Green-Blue (RGB) images of surface water.
HydroVision supports early detection of contamination trends and strengthens
monitoring by regulatory agencies during external environmental stressors,
industrial activities, and force majeure events. The model is trained on more
than 500,000 seasonally varied images collected from the United States
Geological Survey Hydrologic Imagery Visualization and Information System
between 2022 and 2024. This approach leverages widely available RGB imagery as
a scalable, cost-effective alternative to traditional multispectral and
hyperspectral remote sensing. Four state-of-the-art convolutional neural
networks (VGG-16, ResNet50, MobileNetV2, DenseNet121) and a Vision Transformer
are evaluated through transfer learning to identify the best-performing
architecture. DenseNet121 achieves the highest validation performance, with an
R2 score of 0.89 in predicting CDOM, demonstrating the framework's promise for
real-world water quality monitoring across diverse conditions. While the
current model is optimized for well-lit imagery, future work will focus on
improving robustness under low-light and obstructed scenarios to expand its
operational utility.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a zero-shot framework utilizing pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) for wildfire property damage assessment from ground-level imagery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for rapid and accurate property damage assessments due to the increasing intensity and frequency of wildfires, coupled with limitations of time-consuming traditional methods and modern approaches requiring large labeled datasets.

Method: Development of two pipelines: (A) VLM and (B) VLM + large language model (LLM) using structured prompts based on wildfire damage indicators. These were tested on imagery from the 2025 Eaton and Palisades fires.

Result: Multi-view analysis offered significant improvements in damage classification (F1 scores: 0.857 to 0.947) over single-view assessments (F1 scores: 0.225 to 0.511). No significant difference was found between pipelines A and B.

Conclusion: The framework is deployable and bypasses supervised training, offering a faster, interpretable solution for disaster response. Future research can further refine LLM use in damage assessment.

Abstract: The escalating intensity and frequency of wildfires demand innovative
computational methods for rapid and accurate property damage assessment.
Traditional methods are often time consuming, while modern computer vision
approaches typically require extensive labeled datasets, hindering immediate
post-disaster deployment. This research introduces a novel, zero-shot framework
leveraging pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) to classify damage from
ground-level imagery. We propose and evaluate two pipelines applied to the 2025
Eaton and Palisades fires in California, a VLM (Pipeline A) and a VLM + large
language model (LLM) approach (Pipeline B), that integrate structured prompts
based on specific wildfire damage indicators. A primary scientific contribution
of this study is demonstrating the VLMs efficacy in synthesizing information
from multiple perspectives to identify nuanced damage, a critical limitation in
existing literature. Our findings reveal that while single view assessments
struggled to classify affected structures (F1 scores ranging from 0.225 to
0.511), the multi-view analysis yielded dramatic improvements (F1 scores
ranging from 0.857 to 0.947). Moreover, the McNemar test confirmed that
pipelines with a multi-view image assessment yields statistically significant
classification improvements; however, the improvements this research observed
between Pipeline A and B were not statistically significant. Thus, future
research can explore the potential of LLM prompting in damage assessment. The
practical contribution is an immediately deployable, flexible, and
interpretable workflow that bypasses the need for supervised training,
significantly accelerating triage and prioritization for disaster response
practitioners.

*Zhipeng Weng,Xiaopeng Liu,Ce Liu,Xingyuan Guo,Yukai Shi,Liang Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Gaussian quantization representation learning method to address overfitting issues in large-scale diffusion models, particularly for few-shot, drone-captured infrared super-resolution tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overfitting significantly affects the generalization of large-scale models, particularly in few-shot scenarios like drone-based infrared super-resolution tasks.

Method: The method introduces Gaussian quantization representation learning to reduce overfitting and employ a monitoring mechanism to track overfitting during training. Additionally, a multi-source drone-based infrared image benchmark dataset is constructed.

Result: Experimental results show that the proposed method mitigates overfitting in large-scale architectures and surpasses existing super-resolution techniques under diverse and complex conditions.

Conclusion: The approach enhances the robustness of large-scale diffusion models in few-shot scenarios, demonstrating its value in mitigating overfitting while maintaining model complexity.

Abstract: Although large scale models achieve significant improvements in performance,
the overfitting challenge still frequently undermines their generalization
ability. In super resolution tasks on images, diffusion models as
representatives of generative models typically adopt large scale architectures.
However, few-shot drone-captured infrared training data frequently induces
severe overfitting in large-scale architectures. To address this key challenge,
our method proposes a new Gaussian quantization representation learning method
oriented to diffusion models that alleviates overfitting and enhances
robustness. At the same time, an effective monitoring mechanism tracks large
scale architectures during training to detect signs of overfitting. By
introducing Gaussian quantization representation learning, our method
effectively reduces overfitting while maintaining architecture complexity. On
this basis, we construct a multi source drone-based infrared image benchmark
dataset for detection and use it to emphasize overfitting issues of large scale
architectures in few sample, drone-based diverse drone-based image
reconstruction scenarios. To verify the efficacy of the method in mitigating
overfitting, experiments are conducted on the constructed benchmark.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing super
resolution approaches and significantly mitigates overfitting of large scale
architectures under complex conditions. The code and DroneSR dataset will be

TL;DR: The RSCC dataset introduces 62,315 pre-/post-disaster image pairs with detailed captions, facilitating better disaster analysis using vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current remote sensing datasets lack temporal image pairs and detailed captions, limiting the ability to monitor dynamic disaster impacts.

Method: A large-scale dataset (RSCC) was created with 62,315 pre-/post-disaster image pairs and corresponding detailed human-like captions.

Result: RSCC enables detailed disaster-related analysis, improving training and evaluation of vision-language models for bi-temporal understanding.

Conclusion: This dataset bridges gaps in dynamic disaster monitoring and enhances scalable and interpretable remote sensing applications.

Abstract: Remote sensing is critical for disaster monitoring, yet existing datasets
lack temporal image pairs and detailed textual annotations. While
single-snapshot imagery dominates current resources, it fails to capture
dynamic disaster impacts over time. To address this gap, we introduce the
Remote Sensing Change Caption (RSCC) dataset, a large-scale benchmark
comprising 62,315 pre-/post-disaster image pairs (spanning earthquakes, floods,
wildfires, and more) paired with rich, human-like change captions. By bridging
the temporal and semantic divide in remote sensing data, RSCC enables robust
training and evaluation of vision-language models for disaster-aware
bi-temporal understanding. Our results highlight RSCC's ability to facilitate
detailed disaster-related analysis, paving the way for more accurate,
interpretable, and scalable vision-language applications in remote sensing.

### [400] [Towards Interpretable Geo-localization: a Concept-Aware Global Image-GPS Alignment Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01910)
*Furong Jia,Lanxin Liu,Ce Hou,Fan Zhang,Xinyan Liu,Yu Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new framework for geo-localization, combining image-location alignment with interpretable geographic concepts, outperforming prior models like GeoCLIP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Geo-localization models face a lack of interpretability despite their accuracy, which hinders understanding how predictions are made for geographic images.

Method: The authors propose a Concept-Aware Alignment Module to align image and location embeddings through a shared bank of geographic concepts, using a concept-specific loss for enhanced performance and interpretability.

Result: Their approach outperforms GeoCLIP in geo-localization accuracy and other geospatial tasks, offering deeper semantic understanding behind geographic predictions.

Conclusion: Integrating interpretability into geo-localization models significantly improves both prediction performance and the understanding of location-based decisions.

Abstract: Worldwide geo-localization involves determining the exact geographic location
of images captured globally, typically guided by geographic cues such as
climate, landmarks, and architectural styles. Despite advancements in
geo-localization models like GeoCLIP, which leverages images and location
alignment via contrastive learning for accurate predictions, the
interpretability of these models remains insufficiently explored. Current
concept-based interpretability methods fail to align effectively with
Geo-alignment image-location embedding objectives, resulting in suboptimal
interpretability and performance. To address this gap, we propose a novel
framework integrating global geo-localization with concept bottlenecks. Our
method inserts a Concept-Aware Alignment Module that jointly projects image and
location embeddings onto a shared bank of geographic concepts (e.g., tropical
climate, mountain, cathedral) and minimizes a concept-level loss, enhancing
alignment in a concept-specific subspace and enabling robust interpretability.
To our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce interpretability into
geo-localization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach surpasses
GeoCLIP in geo-localization accuracy and boosts performance across diverse
geospatial prediction tasks, revealing richer semantic insights into geographic
decision-making processes.

### [401] [Structure-aware Contrastive Learning for Diagram Understanding of Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01959)
*Hiroshi Sasaki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel training paradigm for improving vision-language models' understanding of diagrammatic images, showing superior results compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models like CLIP struggle to process and understand diagrammatic images due to their structured and symbolic nature, distinct from natural images.

Method: A contrastive learning approach with two specialized loss functions focusing on structural properties of diagrams, applied to hard samples.

Result: Results show improved performance on flowcharts for image-text matching and visual question answering tasks compared to standard CLIP approaches.

Conclusion: Tailored training is critical for specialized tasks, advancing the integration of vision and language for diagrammatic content.

Abstract: Multimodal models, such as the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)
model, have demonstrated remarkable success in aligning visual and linguistic
representations. However, these models exhibit limitations when applied to
specialised visual domains, such as diagrams, which encode structured, symbolic
information distinct from that of natural imagery.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel training paradigm explicitly designed to
enhance the comprehension of diagrammatic images within vision-language models.
Our approach uses ``hard'' samples for our proposed contrastive learning that
incorporates two specialised loss functions that leverage the inherent
structural properties of diagrams. By integrating these objectives into model
training, our method enables models to develop a more structured and
semantically coherent understanding of diagrammatic content.
  We empirically validate our approach on a benchmark dataset of flowcharts, as
a representative class of diagrammatic imagery, demonstrating substantial
improvements over standard CLIP and conventional hard negative CLIP learning
paradigms for both image-text matching and visual question answering tasks. Our
findings underscore the significance of tailored training strategies for
specialised tasks and contribute to advancing diagrammatic understanding within
the broader landscape of vision-language integration.

*Hongyu Li,Chaofeng Chen,Xiaoming Li,Guangming Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new image inpainting framework using 2D Gaussian Splatting, which utilizes a continuous field of coefficients and differentiable rasterization for pixel coherence and semantic restoration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore the untapped potential of Gaussian Splatting in image inpainting, focusing on pixel-level coherence and global semantic consistency.

Method: A framework based on 2D Gaussian Splatting that uses patch-wise rasterization for efficiency and DINO-pretrained global features to ensure semantic alignment.

Result: The method achieves competitive performance in both metrics and perceptual quality, demonstrating its effectiveness in standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: The study opens a new direction for employing Gaussian Splatting in 2D image processing, highlighting its promise in handling image inpainting tasks.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS), a recent technique for converting discrete points
into continuous spatial representations, has shown promising results in 3D
scene modeling and 2D image super-resolution. In this paper, we explore its
untapped potential for image inpainting, which demands both locally coherent
pixel synthesis and globally consistent semantic restoration. We propose the
first image inpainting framework based on 2D Gaussian Splatting, which encodes
incomplete images into a continuous field of 2D Gaussian splat coefficients and
reconstructs the final image via a differentiable rasterization process. The
continuous rendering paradigm of GS inherently promotes pixel-level coherence
in the inpainted results. To improve efficiency and scalability, we introduce a
patch-wise rasterization strategy that reduces memory overhead and accelerates
inference. For global semantic consistency, we incorporate features from a
pretrained DINO model. We observe that DINO's global features are naturally
robust to small missing regions and can be effectively adapted to guide
semantic alignment in large-mask scenarios, ensuring that the inpainted content
remains contextually consistent with the surrounding scene. Extensive
experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves
competitive performance in both quantitative metrics and perceptual quality,
establishing a new direction for applying Gaussian Splatting to 2D image
processing.

### [403] [MOSAIC: Multi-Subject Personalized Generation via Correspondence-Aware Alignment and Disentanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01977)
*Dong She,Siming Fu,Mushui Liu,Qiaoqiao Jin,Hualiang Wang,Mu Liu,Jidong Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MOSAIC, a framework for multi-subject image generation which resolves issues like identity blending and attribute leakage by employing explicit semantic correspondence and orthogonal feature disentanglement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in generating images with multiple reference subjects, which often leads to identity and attribute inconsistencies in existing methods.

Method: It proposes a dataset, SemAlign-MS, for fine-grained semantic correspondences and designs two loss mechanisms: semantic correspondence attention loss for point-to-point alignment and multi-reference disentanglement loss for separating subject features.

Result: Experiments show that MOSAIC outperforms existing models, maintaining identity fidelity and semantic coherence even for 4+ reference subjects.

Conclusion: MOSAIC is a promising approach for multi-subject synthesis, enabling advanced applications by ensuring fidelity and coherence when handling complex multi-subject inputs.

Abstract: Multi-subject personalized generation presents unique challenges in
maintaining identity fidelity and semantic coherence when synthesizing images
conditioned on multiple reference subjects. Existing methods often suffer from
identity blending and attribute leakage due to inadequate modeling of how
different subjects should interact within shared representation spaces. We
present MOSAIC, a representation-centric framework that rethinks multi-subject
generation through explicit semantic correspondence and orthogonal feature
disentanglement. Our key insight is that multi-subject generation requires
precise semantic alignment at the representation level - knowing exactly which
regions in the generated image should attend to which parts of each reference.
To enable this, we introduce SemAlign-MS, a meticulously annotated dataset
providing fine-grained semantic correspondences between multiple reference
subjects and target images, previously unavailable in this domain. Building on
this foundation, we propose the semantic correspondence attention loss to
enforce precise point-to-point semantic alignment, ensuring high consistency
from each reference to its designated regions. Furthermore, we develop the
multi-reference disentanglement loss to push different subjects into orthogonal
attention subspaces, preventing feature interference while preserving
individual identity characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MOSAIC achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks. Notably,
while existing methods typically degrade beyond 3 subjects, MOSAIC maintains
high fidelity with 4+ reference subjects, opening new possibilities for complex
multi-subject synthesis applications.

*Quan Dao,Xiaoxiao He,Ligong Han,Ngan Hoai Nguyen,Amin Heyrani Nobar,Faez Ahmed,Han Zhang,Viet Anh Nguyen,Dimitris Metaxas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces VARIN, a noise inversion-based editing technique for visual autoregressive models, enabling precise text-to-image editing without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expand the utility of visual autoregressive models beyond text-to-image generation, introducing capabilities for prompt-guided image editing that maintain background and structural integrity.

Method: VARIN utilizes Location-aware Argmax Inversion (LAI) to generate inverse Gumbel noises, which allow for accurate reconstruction of source images and effective, controlled edits guided by textual prompts.

Result: Extensive experiments confirm that VARIN modifies images according to prompts with superior preservation of original image backgrounds and structure, demonstrating its practical efficacy.

Conclusion: VARIN establishes visual autoregressive models as a viable tool for prompt-guided image editing, offering a reliable and controllable approach without the need for retraining.

Abstract: Visual autoregressive models (VAR) have recently emerged as a promising class
of generative models, achieving performance comparable to diffusion models in
text-to-image generation tasks. While conditional generation has been widely
explored, the ability to perform prompt-guided image editing without additional
training is equally critical, as it supports numerous practical real-world
applications. This paper investigates the text-to-image editing capabilities of
VAR by introducing Visual AutoRegressive Inverse Noise (VARIN), the first noise
inversion-based editing technique designed explicitly for VAR models. VARIN
leverages a novel pseudo-inverse function for argmax sampling, named
Location-aware Argmax Inversion (LAI), to generate inverse Gumbel noises. These
inverse noises enable precise reconstruction of the source image and facilitate
targeted, controllable edits aligned with textual prompts. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that VARIN effectively modifies source images according
to specified prompts while significantly preserving the original background and
structural details, thus validating its efficacy as a practical editing
approach.

### [405] [Draw-In-Mind: Learning Precise Image Editing via Chain-of-Thought Imagination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01986)
*Ziyun Zeng,Junhao Zhang,Wei Li,Mike Zheng Shou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new dataset, Draw-In-Mind (DIM), aimed at improving image editing capabilities in multimodal models by redistributing the tasks between understanding and generation modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal models struggle with precise image editing due to imbalanced task distribution between the understanding and generation modules. This paper aims to address this problem.

Method: The approach involves creating the DIM dataset with two subsets (DIM-T2I for understanding and DIM-Edit for image-editing design blueprints) and developing DIM-4.6B-T2I/Edit by connecting existing models with a lightweight multilayer perceptron.

Result: DIM-4.6B-Edit achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance on ImgEdit and GEdit-Bench benchmarks, exceeding models with larger parameter scales like UniWorld-V1 and Step1X-Edit.

Conclusion: Assigning design responsibilities to the understanding module significantly improves image editing capabilities. The dataset and models will be made publicly available.

Abstract: In recent years, integrating multimodal understanding and generation into a
single unified model has emerged as a promising paradigm. While this approach
achieves strong results in text-to-image (T2I) generation, it still struggles
with precise image editing. We attribute this limitation to an imbalanced
division of responsibilities. The understanding module primarily functions as a
translator that encodes user instructions into semantic conditions, while the
generation module must simultaneously act as designer and painter, inferring
the original layout, identifying the target editing region, and rendering the
new content. This imbalance is counterintuitive because the understanding
module is typically trained with several times more data on complex reasoning
tasks than the generation module. To address this issue, we introduce
Draw-In-Mind (DIM), a dataset comprising two complementary subsets: (i)
DIM-T2I, containing 14M long-context image-text pairs to enhance complex
instruction comprehension; and (ii) DIM-Edit, consisting of 233K
chain-of-thought imaginations generated by GPT-4o, serving as explicit design
blueprints for image edits. We connect a frozen Qwen2.5-VL-3B with a trainable
SANA1.5-1.6B via a lightweight two-layer MLP, and train it on the proposed DIM
dataset, resulting in DIM-4.6B-T2I/Edit. Despite its modest parameter scale,
DIM-4.6B-Edit achieves SOTA or competitive performance on the ImgEdit and
GEdit-Bench benchmarks, outperforming much larger models such as UniWorld-V1
and Step1X-Edit. These findings demonstrate that explicitly assigning the
design responsibility to the understanding module provides significant benefits
for image editing. Our dataset and models will be available at
https://github.com/showlab/DIM.

TL;DR: The Palette-Adapter offers a method to condition text-to-image diffusion models using specified color palettes, overcoming challenges like ambiguity and instability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the ambiguity and instability faced when employing color palettes as conditioning tools for text-to-image generation models.

Method: The authors treat palettes as sparse histograms and introduce parameters like histogram entropy and palette-to-histogram distance for control. A mechanism to suppress undesired hues is also proposed, and training is carried out on a curated dataset covering diverse colors.

Result: The proposed method achieves stable and semantically coherent image generation aligned with input palettes and outperforms existing techniques in both adherence and quality.

Conclusion: The Palette-Adapter offers a significant improvement in integrating palettes for creative text-to-image generation workflows, with controllable and reliable results.

Abstract: We introduce the Palette-Adapter, a novel method for conditioning
text-to-image diffusion models on a user-specified color palette. While
palettes are a compact and intuitive tool widely used in creative workflows,
they introduce significant ambiguity and instability when used for conditioning
image generation. Our approach addresses this challenge by interpreting
palettes as sparse histograms and introducing two scalar control parameters:
histogram entropy and palette-to-histogram distance, which allow flexible
control over the degree of palette adherence and color variation. We further
introduce a negative histogram mechanism that allows users to suppress specific
undesired hues, improving adherence to the intended palette under the standard
classifier-free guidance mechanism. To ensure broad generalization across the
color space, we train on a carefully curated dataset with balanced coverage of
rare and common colors. Our method enables stable, semantically coherent
generation across a wide range of palettes and prompts. We evaluate our method
qualitatively, quantitatively, and through a user study, and show that it
consistently outperforms existing approaches in achieving both strong palette
adherence and high image quality.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a noninvasive, automated vision-based system for monitoring neonatal behavior using lightweight models on a Raspberry Pi, achieving high accuracy and efficiency for low-resource settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the need for scalable and noninvasive monitoring solutions in neonatal intensive care, especially in low-resource environments where manual observation and invasive sensors are impractical or harmful.

Method: The authors propose an embedded system featuring a quantized MobileNet model deployed on a Raspberry Pi. It uses public neonatal image datasets for real-time behavioral state detection with secure IoT communication for alert systems.

Result: The system achieved state-of-the-art accuracy (91.8% for sleep detection and 97.7% for crying/normal classification) and maintained computational efficiency, making it suitable for edge device deployment.

Conclusion: The proposed lightweight and optimized MobileNet-based framework offers a cost-effective, scalable, and practical solution for NICU monitoring, addressing current challenges in preterm infant care.

Abstract: Preterm birth remains a leading cause of neonatal mortality,
disproportionately affecting low-resource settings with limited access to
advanced neonatal intensive care units (NICUs).Continuous monitoring of infant
behavior, such as sleep/awake states and crying episodes, is critical but
relies on manual observation or invasive sensors, which are prone to error,
impractical, and can cause skin damage. This paper presents a novel,
noninvasive, and automated vision-based framework to address this gap. We
introduce an embedded monitoring system that utilizes a quantized MobileNet
model deployed on a Raspberry Pi for real-time behavioral state detection. When
trained and evaluated on public neonatal image datasets, our system achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy (91.8% for sleep detection and 97.7% for
crying/normal classification) while maintaining computational efficiency
suitable for edge deployment. Through comparative benchmarking, we provide a
critical analysis of the trade-offs between model size, inference latency, and
diagnostic accuracy. Our findings demonstrate that while larger architectures
(e.g., ResNet152, VGG19) offer marginal gains in accuracy, their computational
cost is prohibitive for real-time edge use. The proposed framework integrates
three key innovations: model quantization for memory-efficient inference (68%
reduction in size), Raspberry Pi-optimized vision pipelines, and secure IoT
communication for clinical alerts. This work conclusively shows that
lightweight, optimized models such as the MobileNet offer the most viable
foundation for scalable, low-cost, and clinically actionable NICU monitoring
systems, paving the way for improved preterm care in resource-constrained
environments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the underutilization of synthetic hard negatives in enhancing the discriminative capabilities of vision transformers.

Method: The method involves integrating synthetic hard negatives into the training process of vision transformers, specifically focusing on DeiT-S and Swin-T architectures.

Result: The proposed integration led to enhanced performance and discriminative power in the representations learned by these architectures.

Conclusion: Using synthetic hard negatives presents a simple and effective approach to improving the representation learning and performance of vision transformers.

Abstract: This paper does not introduce a novel method per se. Instead, we address the
neglected potential of hard negative samples in self-supervised learning.
Previous works explored synthetic hard negatives but rarely in the context of
vision transformers. We build on this observation and integrate synthetic hard
negatives to improve vision transformer representation learning. This simple
yet effective technique notably improves the discriminative power of learned
representations. Our experiments show performance improvements for both DeiT-S

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates the vulnerabilities of Referring Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT) systems, revealing key security weaknesses and introducing VEIL, an adversarial framework to exploit them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and address the security and robustness challenges in RMOT systems which integrate language and vision for selective multi-object tracking.

Method: The researchers analyze RMOT systems from a design-logic perspective, develop VEIL as an adversarial attack framework, and validate its effectiveness through experiments on the Refer-KITTI dataset.

Result: VEIL successfully demonstrates how digital and physical perturbations can compromise RMOT systems, causing errors like track ID switches and track terminations.

Conclusion: There is a critical need to develop security-aware designs for RMOT systems to ensure their reliability in large-scale applications.

Abstract: Language-vision understanding has driven the development of advanced
perception systems, most notably the emerging paradigm of Referring
Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT). By leveraging natural-language queries, RMOT
systems can selectively track objects that satisfy a given semantic
description, guided through Transformer-based spatial-temporal reasoning
modules. End-to-End (E2E) RMOT models further unify feature extraction,
temporal memory, and spatial reasoning within a Transformer backbone, enabling
long-range spatial-temporal modeling over fused textual-visual representations.
Despite these advances, the reliability and robustness of RMOT remain
underexplored. In this paper, we examine the security implications of RMOT
systems from a design-logic perspective, identifying adversarial
vulnerabilities that compromise both the linguistic-visual referring and
track-object matching components. Additionally, we uncover a novel
vulnerability in advanced RMOT models employing FIFO-based memory, whereby
targeted and consistent attacks on their spatial-temporal reasoning introduce
errors that persist within the history buffer over multiple subsequent frames.
We present VEIL, a novel adversarial framework designed to disrupt the unified
referring-matching mechanisms of RMOT models. We show that carefully crafted
digital and physical perturbations can corrupt the tracking logic reliability,
inducing track ID switches and terminations. We conduct comprehensive
evaluations using the Refer-KITTI dataset to validate the effectiveness of VEIL
and demonstrate the urgent need for security-aware RMOT designs for critical
large-scale applications.

TL;DR: This paper explores the integration of generative synthetic data to enhance self-supervised learning for vision transformers, reducing reliance on vast real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the dependency of contrastive self-supervised learning on massive real-world datasets and carefully curated hard negatives.

Method: Two methods of synthetic enhancement are used: (1) Generative models for augmenting sample diversity and (2) Synthetic hard negatives in representation space for challenging contrasts.

Result: The approach, Syn2Co, demonstrates the promise and limitations of synthetic data, particularly on DeiT-S and Swin-T architectures, in achieving robust visual representations.

Conclusion: Synthetic data has potential in self-supervised learning, though there are limitations that require further exploration.

Abstract: This paper does not introduce a new method per se. Instead, we build on
existing self-supervised learning approaches for vision, drawing inspiration
from the adage "fake it till you make it". While contrastive self-supervised
learning has achieved remarkable success, it typically relies on vast amounts
of real-world data and carefully curated hard negatives. To explore
alternatives to these requirements, we investigate two forms of "faking it" in
vision transformers. First, we study the potential of generative models for
unsupervised representation learning, leveraging synthetic data to augment
sample diversity. Second, we examine the feasibility of generating synthetic
hard negatives in the representation space, creating diverse and challenging
contrasts. Our framework - dubbed Syn2Co - combines both approaches and
evaluates whether synthetically enhanced training can lead to more robust and
transferable visual representations on DeiT-S and Swin-T architectures. Our
findings highlight the promise and limitations of synthetic data in
self-supervised learning, offering insights for future work in this direction.

*Pinzhuo Tian,Shengjie Yang,Hang Yu,Alex C. Kot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses two key issues in slot attention methods for object-centric learning: lack of semantic information and inability to fine-tune encoders. It introduces new components, ContextFusion and a Bootstrap Branch, to tackle these problems, leading to significant improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current slot attention methods overly depend on low-level features and lack adaptability in their encoders, which limits effective object-centric learning.

Method: The authors propose ContextFusion to integrate high-level semantic information and an auxiliary indicator, and a Bootstrap Branch to decouple feature adaptation from reconstruction, enabling more flexible fine-tuning.

Result: The proposed method significantly enhances the performance of various slot attention models on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Integrating ContextFusion and the Bootstrap Branch into existing slot attention frameworks provides a more semantically rich and flexible mechanism, overcoming key limitations of current methods and boosting performance.

Abstract: A key human ability is to decompose a scene into distinct objects and use
their relationships to understand the environment. Object-centric learning aims
to mimic this process in an unsupervised manner. Recently, the slot
attention-based framework has emerged as a leading approach in this area and
has been widely used in various downstream tasks. However, existing slot
attention methods face two key limitations: (1) a lack of high-level semantic
information. In current methods, image areas are assigned to slots based on
low-level features such as color and texture. This makes the model overly
sensitive to low-level features and limits its understanding of object
contours, shapes, or other semantic characteristics. (2) The inability to
fine-tune the encoder. Current methods require a stable feature space
throughout training to enable reconstruction from slots, which restricts the
flexibility needed for effective object-centric learning. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel ContextFusion stage and a Bootstrap Branch,
both of which can be seamlessly integrated into existing slot attention models.
In the ContextFusion stage, we exploit semantic information from the foreground
and background, incorporating an auxiliary indicator that provides additional
contextual cues about them to enrich the semantic content beyond low-level
features. In the Bootstrap Branch, we decouple feature adaptation from the
original reconstruction phase and introduce a bootstrap strategy to train a
feature-adaptive mechanism, allowing for more flexible adaptation. Experimental
results show that our method significantly improves the performance of
different SOTA slot attention models on both simulated and real-world datasets.

### [413] [A Data-Centric Approach to Pedestrian Attribute Recognition: Synthetic Augmentation via Prompt-driven Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02099)
*Alejandro Alonso,Sawaiz A. Chaudhry,Juan C. SanMiguel,Álvaro García-Martín,Pablo Ayuso-Albizu,Pablo Carballeira*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a data-centric approach to improve Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) using synthetic data augmentation guided by textual descriptions. This effort improves performance on underrepresented attributes and strengthens zero-shot generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PAR involves identifying multiple attributes of pedestrians, but existing approaches struggle due to dataset limitations, particularly the under-representation of certain attributes.

Method: The authors propose a synthetic data augmentation method guided by textual prompts. They define a protocol to identify weak attributes, use diffusion models for synthetic image generation, and incorporate these samples with prompt-based annotations and adjusted loss functions.

Result: Experiments on PAR datasets show enhanced recognition for underrepresented attributes and overall model performance improvement. Importantly, the model benefits from zero-shot generalization without architectural modifications.

Conclusion: The approach is effective, scalable, and efficient, making it a viable solution for improving pedestrian attribute recognition in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) is a challenging task as models are
required to generalize across numerous attributes in real-world data.
Traditional approaches focus on complex methods, yet recognition performance is
often constrained by training dataset limitations, particularly the
under-representation of certain attributes. In this paper, we propose a
data-centric approach to improve PAR by synthetic data augmentation guided by
textual descriptions. First, we define a protocol to identify weakly recognized
attributes across multiple datasets. Second, we propose a prompt-driven
pipeline that leverages diffusion models to generate synthetic pedestrian
images while preserving the consistency of PAR datasets. Finally, we derive a
strategy to seamlessly incorporate synthetic samples into training data, which
considers prompt-based annotation rules and modifies the loss function. Results
on popular PAR datasets demonstrate that our approach not only boosts
recognition of underrepresented attributes but also improves overall model
performance beyond the targeted attributes. Notably, this approach strengthens
zero-shot generalization without requiring architectural changes of the model,
presenting an efficient and scalable solution to improve the recognition of
attributes of pedestrians in the real world.

*Matic Fučka,Vitjan Zavrtanik,Danijel Skočaj*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SALAD is a new logical anomaly detection method designed to overcome challenges in detecting missing or irregular object components by leveraging semantic relationships and composition maps, achieving outstanding performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with detecting logical anomalies due to a lack of semantic and spatial information modeling.

Method: SALAD integrates a composition branch to model object composition maps without manual labels, enhancing semantic relationships.

Result: SALAD achieves notable results with an AUROC score of 96.1% on the MVTec LOCO benchmark for logical anomaly detection.

Conclusion: SALAD proves to be highly effective in addressing logical anomaly challenges and surpasses state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Recent surface anomaly detection methods excel at identifying structural
anomalies, such as dents and scratches, but struggle with logical anomalies,
such as irregular or missing object components. The best-performing logical
anomaly detection approaches rely on aggregated pretrained features or
handcrafted descriptors (most often derived from composition maps), which
discard spatial and semantic information, leading to suboptimal performance. We
propose SALAD, a semantics-aware discriminative logical anomaly detection
method that incorporates a newly proposed composition branch to explicitly
model the distribution of object composition maps, consequently learning
important semantic relationships. Additionally, we introduce a novel procedure
for extracting composition maps that requires no hand-made labels or
category-specific information, in contrast to previous methods. By effectively
modelling the composition map distribution, SALAD significantly improves upon
state-of-the-art methods on the standard benchmark for logical anomaly
detection, MVTec LOCO, achieving an impressive image-level AUROC of 96.1%.

*Nils Hoehing,Mayug Maniparambil,Ellen Rushe,Noel E. O'Connor,Anthony Ventresque*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RocketScience, a new benchmark for testing spatial relation understanding in visual language models (VLMs), using real-world image-text pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding spatial relationships and object ordering by contemporary visual language models. Most current VLMs struggle with fundamental spatial reasoning tasks that humans find easy.

Method: The benchmark, RocketScience, was designed using new image-text datasets emphasizing relative spatial understanding and object order. It evaluates and distinguishes between object localization and spatial reasoning capabilities.

Result: Findings highlight that current open-source and commercial VLMs lack spatial reasoning capabilities, while reasoning models perform better. Performance is limited by spatial reasoning rather than object localization.

Conclusion: RocketScience reveals a critical weakness in VLMs regarding spatial understanding, and the open release of the benchmark encourages further exploration in improving these models.

Abstract: We propose RocketScience, an open-source contrastive VLM benchmark that tests
for spatial relation understanding. It is comprised of entirely new real-world
image-text pairs covering mostly relative spatial understanding and the order
of objects. The benchmark is designed
  to be very easy for humans and hard for the current generation of VLMs, and
this is empirically verified. Our results show a striking lack of spatial
relation understanding in open source and frontier commercial VLMs and a
surprisingly high performance of reasoning models. Additionally, we perform a
disentanglement analysis to separate the contributions of object localization
and spatial reasoning in chain-of-thought-based models and find that the
performance on the benchmark is bottlenecked by spatial reasoning and not
object localization capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces NOOUGAT, a tracker handling both online and offline Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) effectively via a Graph Neural Network framework and Autoregressive Long-term Tracking layer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations and fragmented solutions in online and offline MOT, enabling flexible tracking for real-world applications.

Method: NOOUGAT utilizes a Graph Neural Network to process subclips of video and introduces the Autoregressive Long-term Tracking layer to fuse temporal data seamlessly across varying horizons.

Result: NOOUGAT achieves state-of-the-art results in online tracking (+2.3 AssA on DanceTrack, +9.2 on SportsMOT, and +5.0 on MOT20) and delivers even stronger performance in offline regimes.

Conclusion: The NOOUGAT system successfully bridges the gap between online and offline MOT, proving effective across diverse tracking scenarios and latency requirements.

Abstract: The long-standing division between \textit{online} and \textit{offline}
Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) has led to fragmented solutions that fail to
address the flexible temporal requirements of real-world deployment scenarios.
Current \textit{online} trackers rely on frame-by-frame hand-crafted
association strategies and struggle with long-term occlusions, whereas
\textit{offline} approaches can cover larger time gaps, but still rely on
heuristic stitching for arbitrarily long sequences. In this paper, we introduce
NOOUGAT, the first tracker designed to operate with arbitrary temporal
horizons. NOOUGAT leverages a unified Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework that
processes non-overlapping subclips, and fuses them through a novel
Autoregressive Long-term Tracking (ALT) layer. The subclip size controls the
trade-off between latency and temporal context, enabling a wide range of
deployment scenarios, from frame-by-frame to batch processing. NOOUGAT achieves
state-of-the-art performance across both tracking regimes, improving
\textit{online} AssA by +2.3 on DanceTrack, +9.2 on SportsMOT, and +5.0 on
MOT20, with even greater gains in \textit{offline} mode.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of hair artifacts in dermoscopic images affecting skin lesion analysis by proposing a fine-tuned SegFormer model with dropout regularization for accurate hair mask segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hair artifacts obstruct critical diagnostic features in skin lesion images, complicating accurate dermatological assessments.

Method: A SegFormer model with MiT-B2 encoder pretrained on ImageNet was fine-tuned with dropout regularization (probability: 0.3). Training employed a dataset of 500 annotated images using 10-fold cross-validation, AdamW optimization, early stopping, and multiple evaluation metrics such as Dice coefficient and Intersection over Union (IoU).

Result: The model achieved robust performance with average Dice coefficients of 0.96, IoU of 0.93, PSNR around 34 dB, SSIM of 0.97, and LPIPS of 0.06, demonstrating precise hair artifact segmentation.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture effectively segments hair artifacts, enhancing image preprocessing for downstream skin cancer detection tasks.

Abstract: Hair artifacts in dermoscopic images present significant challenges for
accurate skin lesion analysis, potentially obscuring critical diagnostic
features in dermatological assessments. This work introduces a fine-tuned
SegFormer model augmented with dropout regularization to achieve precise hair
mask segmentation. The proposed SegformerWithDropout architecture leverages the
MiT-B2 encoder, pretrained on ImageNet, with an in-channel count of 3 and 2
output classes, incorporating a dropout probability of 0.3 in the segmentation
head to prevent overfitting. Training is conducted on a specialized dataset of
500 dermoscopic skin lesion images with fine-grained hair mask annotations,
employing 10-fold cross-validation, AdamW optimization with a learning rate of
0.001, and cross-entropy loss. Early stopping is applied based on validation
loss, with a patience of 3 epochs and a maximum of 20 epochs per fold.
Performance is evaluated using a comprehensive suite of metrics, including
Intersection over Union (IoU), Dice coefficient, Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio
(PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and Learned Perceptual Image Patch
Similarity (LPIPS). Experimental results from the cross-validation demonstrate
robust performance, with average Dice coefficients reaching approximately 0.96
and IoU values of 0.93, alongside favorable PSNR (around 34 dB), SSIM (0.97),
and low LPIPS (0.06), highlighting the model's effectiveness in accurate hair
artifact segmentation and its potential to enhance preprocessing for downstream
skin cancer detection tasks.

TL;DR: This paper explores using diffusion models to generate synthetic pedestrian images to enhance Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) models in real-world applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of large-scale annotated datasets limits the effectiveness of PAR models, particularly in challenging scenarios like occlusions and diverse environments.

Method: The authors identify and optimize key parameters in img2img diffusion-based data expansion, including text prompts and image properties, for generating synthetic pedestrian images tailored for PAR tasks.

Result: Experimental evaluations reveal that optimal prompt alignment and image property selection lead to a 4.5% improvement in PAR recognition performance.

Conclusion: Diffusion models have significant potential to enhance PAR models by generating high-quality synthetic images, improving the robustness and adaptability of these models in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) involves identifying various human
attributes from images with applications in intelligent monitoring systems. The
scarcity of large-scale annotated datasets hinders the generalization of PAR
models, specially in complex scenarios involving occlusions, varying poses, and
diverse environments. Recent advances in diffusion models have shown promise
for generating diverse and realistic synthetic images, allowing to expand the
size and variability of training data. However, the potential of
diffusion-based data expansion for generating PAR-like images remains
underexplored. Such expansion may enhance the robustness and adaptability of
PAR models in real-world scenarios. This paper investigates the effectiveness
of diffusion models in generating synthetic pedestrian images tailored to PAR
tasks. We identify key parameters of img2img diffusion-based data expansion;
including text prompts, image properties, and the latest enhancements in
diffusion-based data augmentation, and examine their impact on the quality of
generated images for PAR. Furthermore, we employ the best-performing expansion
approach to generate synthetic images for training PAR models, by enriching the
zero-shot datasets. Experimental results show that prompt alignment and image
properties are critical factors in image generation, with optimal selection
leading to a 4.5% improvement in PAR recognition performance.

TL;DR: The paper focuses on panoramic scene understanding by introducing the CFpano dataset and fine-tuning a multimodal large language model (	extmethodname) with novel optimization techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing challenges of geometric distortion and spatial relations in 360° imagery, which are pivotal for applications like autonomous driving and immersive environments.

Method: The paper introduces CFpano, a dataset for 360° VQA, and fine-tunes a multimodal language model using Group Relative Policy Optimization and tailored reward functions.

Result: The methodology achieves state-of-the-art performance in panoramic VQA tasks, with a significant performance improvement (+5.37%) over existing models.

Conclusion: CFpano establishes a new benchmark for cross-frame panoramic reasoning, demonstrating the effectiveness of GRPO and tailored reward functions.

Abstract: Omnidirectional scene understanding is vital for various downstream
applications, such as embodied AI, autonomous driving, and immersive
environments, yet remains challenging due to geometric distortion and complex
spatial relations in 360{\deg} imagery. Existing omnidirectional methods
achieve scene understanding within a single frame while neglecting cross-frame
correlated panoramas. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{CFpano}, the
\textbf{first} benchmark dataset dedicated to cross-frame correlated panoramas
visual question answering in the holistic 360{\deg} scenes. CFpano consists of
over 2700 images together with over 8000 question-answer pairs, and the
question types include both multiple choice and open-ended VQA. Building upon
our CFpano, we further present \methodname, a multi-modal large language model
(MLLM) fine-tuned with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and a set of
tailored reward functions for robust and consistent reasoning with cross-frame
correlated panoramas. Benchmark experiments with existing MLLMs are conducted
with our CFpano. The experimental results demonstrate that \methodname achieves
state-of-the-art performance across both multiple-choice and open-ended VQA
tasks, outperforming strong baselines on all major reasoning categories
(\textbf{+5.37\%} in overall performance). Our analyses validate the
effectiveness of GRPO and establish a new benchmark for panoramic scene
understanding.

### [420] [ADVMEM: Adversarial Memory Initialization for Realistic Test-Time Adaptation via Tracklet-Based Benchmarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02182)
*Shyma Alhuwaider,Motasem Alfarra,Juan C. Perez,Merey Ramazanova,Bernard Ghanem*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new dataset, "ITD" (Inherent Temporal Dependencies), designed to benchmark test-time adaptation (TTA) methods by replicating real-world temporal dependencies, unlike existing datasets. They also propose a strategy that enhances memory-based TTA methods on this benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TTA benchmarks fail to realistically represent scenarios involving natural temporal dependencies, as they overlook temporal continuity often encountered in real-world video streams or sequences.

Method: The authors create the ITD dataset by extracting object-centric tracklet sequences from an existing object-tracking dataset. They then experimentally analyze TTA methods using this dataset and propose a new adversarial memory initialization strategy to improve TTA performance.

Result: The experimental analysis highlights the limitations of current TTA methods when faced with temporal dependencies. The proposed adversarial memory initialization strategy significantly improves the performance of these methods on ITD.

Conclusion: The ITD dataset fills a critical gap in TTA benchmarking by incorporating temporal dependencies. Additionally, the proposed memory initialization strategy effectively addresses some limitations, advancing progress in TTA methods.

Abstract: We introduce a novel tracklet-based dataset for benchmarking test-time
adaptation (TTA) methods. The aim of this dataset is to mimic the intricate
challenges encountered in real-world environments such as images captured by
hand-held cameras, self-driving cars, etc. The current benchmarks for TTA focus
on how models face distribution shifts, when deployed, and on violations to the
customary independent-and-identically-distributed (i.i.d.) assumption in
machine learning. Yet, these benchmarks fail to faithfully represent realistic
scenarios that naturally display temporal dependencies, such as how consecutive
frames from a video stream likely show the same object across time. We address
this shortcoming of current datasets by proposing a novel TTA benchmark we call
the "Inherent Temporal Dependencies" (ITD) dataset. We ensure the instances in
ITD naturally embody temporal dependencies by collecting them from
tracklets-sequences of object-centric images we compile from the bounding boxes
of an object-tracking dataset. We use ITD to conduct a thorough experimental
analysis of current TTA methods, and shed light on the limitations of these
methods when faced with the challenges of temporal dependencies. Moreover, we
build upon these insights and propose a novel adversarial memory initialization
strategy to improve memory-based TTA methods. We find this strategy
substantially boosts the performance of various methods on our challenging
benchmark.

framework for studying the correlations between palmar morphology and
externally validated traits or conditions. The methodology demonstrates
feasibility for applications in digital anthropometry and personalized user

that machine learning models can identify complex patterns in palm data,
opening avenues for research that intersects cultural practices with

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and improve the mechanisms and treatment outcomes for neck pain caused by cervical spondylosis, particularly through better multimodal imaging integration.

Method: Developed the ABPDC module for texture and grayscale analysis and FPRAN for addressing spatial mismatches and misalignments.

Result: Achieved higher prediction accuracy for postoperative neck pain recovery on the MMCSD dataset and validated effectiveness through ablation studies.

Conclusion: The proposed methods significantly enhance multimodal integration and structural alignment, contributing to better prediction and potential treatment for neck pain recovery.

Abstract: Neck pain is the primary symptom of cervical spondylosis, yet its underlying
mechanisms remain unclear, leading to uncertain treatment outcomes. To address
the challenges of multimodal feature fusion caused by imaging differences and
spatial mismatches, this paper proposes an Adaptive Bidirectional Pyramid
Difference Convolution (ABPDC) module that facilitates multimodal integration
by exploiting the advantages of difference convolution in texture extraction
and grayscale invariance, and a Feature Pyramid Registration Auxiliary Network
(FPRAN) to mitigate structural misalignment. Experiments on the MMCSD dataset
demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior prediction accuracy of
postoperative neck pain recovery compared with existing methods, and ablation
studies further confirm its effectiveness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The research presents DSGC-Net, a Dual-Stream Graph Convolutional Network that improves crowd counting in complex scenarios by addressing density and representation challenges using semantic graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing crowd counting methods struggle with density distribution differences and inconsistency in individual appearances due to varying viewpoints and body postures.

Method: The proposed DSGC-Net employs two branches: a Density Approximation (DA) branch that uses density-driven semantic graphs and a Representation Approximation (RA) branch that leverages representation-driven semantic graphs, both processed by graph convolutional networks.

Result: DSGC-Net achieves state-of-the-art results with MAE of 48.9 on ShanghaiTech Part A and 5.9 on Part B, outperforming existing models on three widely used datasets.

Conclusion: DSGC-Net effectively enhances the adaptability to density variations and improves counting accuracy in challenging multi-view and multi-pose crowd scenarios.

Abstract: Deep learning-based crowd counting methods have achieved remarkable progress
in recent years. However, in complex crowd scenarios, existing models still
face challenges when adapting to significant density distribution differences
between regions. Additionally, the inconsistency of individual representations
caused by viewpoint changes and body posture differences further limits the
counting accuracy of the models. To address these challenges, we propose
DSGC-Net, a Dual-Stream Graph Convolutional Network based on feature
correlation mining. DSGC-Net introduces a Density Approximation (DA) branch and
a Representation Approximation (RA) branch. By modeling two semantic graphs, it
captures the potential feature correlations in density variations and
representation distributions. The DA branch incorporates a density prediction
module that generates the density distribution map, and constructs a
density-driven semantic graph based on density similarity. The RA branch
establishes a representation-driven semantic graph by computing global
representation similarity. Then, graph convolutional networks are applied to
the two semantic graphs separately to model the latent semantic relationships,
which enhance the model's ability to adapt to density variations and improve
counting accuracy in multi-view and multi-pose scenarios. Extensive experiments
on three widely used datasets demonstrate that DSGC-Net outperforms current
state-of-the-art methods. In particular, we achieve MAE of 48.9 and 5.9 in
ShanghaiTech Part A and Part B datasets, respectively. The released code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RS-OOD is a novel framework designed for robust few-shot OOD detection in remote sensing imagery using vision-language modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current OOD detection methods for natural images are not suitable for remote sensing due to unique challenges like complex scene structures and distribution shifts.

Method: RS-OOD employs spatial feature enhancement, dual-prompt alignment, and a confidence-guided self-training loop for effective few-shot OOD detection.

Result: RS-OOD consistently outperforms existing methods on multiple benchmarks, achieving robust detection with minimal labeled data.

Conclusion: Integrating spatial and semantic features is critical for advancing OOD detection in remote sensing, as demonstrated by RS-OOD.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection represents a critical challenge in remote
sensing applications, where reliable identification of novel or anomalous
patterns is essential for autonomous monitoring, disaster response, and
environmental assessment. Despite remarkable progress in OOD detection for
natural images, existing methods and benchmarks remain poorly suited to remote
sensing imagery due to data scarcity, complex multi-scale scene structures, and
pronounced distribution shifts. To this end, we propose RS-OOD, a novel
framework that leverages remote sensing-specific vision-language modeling to
enable robust few-shot OOD detection. Our approach introduces three key
innovations: spatial feature enhancement that improved scene discrimination, a
dual-prompt alignment mechanism that cross-verifies scene context against
fine-grained semantics for spatial-semantic consistency, and a
confidence-guided self-training loop that dynamically mines pseudo-labels to
expand training data without manual annotation. RS-OOD consistently outperforms
existing methods across multiple remote sensing benchmarks and enables
efficient adaptation with minimal labeled data, demonstrating the critical
value of spatial-semantic integration.

TL;DR: This paper introduces SynthGenNet, a self-supervised architecture that uses synthetic imagery for robust domain generalization in urban scenes, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in urban scene understanding and generalization, especially involving complex layouts and variability, with reduced reliance on labeled real-world data.

Method: SynthGenNet uses ClassMix++ for blending synthetic labeled data, Grounded Mask Consistency Loss for prediction consistency, and Pseudo-Label Guided Contrastive Learning to distill domain-invariant features.

Result: SynthGenNet achieves 50% Mean Intersection-Over-Union (mIoU) on real-world datasets, surpassing single-source state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: SynthGenNet enhances urban scene understanding, bridging sim-to-real gaps and achieving robustness with synthetic data.

Abstract: Unstructured urban environments present unique challenges for scene
understanding and generalization due to their complex and diverse layouts. We
introduce SynthGenNet, a self-supervised student-teacher architecture designed
to enable robust test-time domain generalization using synthetic multi-source
imagery. Our contributions include the novel ClassMix++ algorithm, which blends
labeled data from various synthetic sources while maintaining semantic
integrity, enhancing model adaptability. We further employ Grounded Mask
Consistency Loss (GMC), which leverages source ground truth to improve
cross-domain prediction consistency and feature alignment. The Pseudo-Label
Guided Contrastive Learning (PLGCL) mechanism is integrated into the student
network to facilitate domain-invariant feature learning through iterative
knowledge distillation from the teacher network. This self-supervised strategy
improves prediction accuracy, addresses real-world variability, bridges the
sim-to-real domain gap, and reliance on labeled target data, even in complex
urban areas. Outcomes show our model outperforms the state-of-the-art (relying
on single source) by achieving 50% Mean Intersection-Over-Union (mIoU) value on
real-world datasets like Indian Driving Dataset (IDD).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Text-to-image models struggle with spatial reasoning tasks, and the Learn-to-Steer framework trains lightweight classifiers to decode spatial relationships directly from internal representations, achieving significant improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image models frequently fail at simple spatial reasoning tasks, such as positioning objects as instructed, especially for complex spatial arrangements.

Method: Learn-to-Steer trains lightweight classifiers to learn spatial objectives directly from cross-attention maps, avoiding handcrafted losses. A dual-inversion technique is used to enforce true geometric understanding.

Result: The method improved spatial accuracy from 0.20 to 0.61 on FLUX.1-dev and from 0.07 to 0.54 on SD2.1 benchmarks, demonstrating generalization to diverse spatial relations.

Conclusion: The proposed framework surpasses traditional approaches in spatial reasoning, offering an effective, data-driven solution for text-to-image diffusion models.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models can generate stunning visuals, yet they often
fail at tasks children find trivial--like placing a dog to the right of a teddy
bear rather than to the left. When combinations get more unusual--a giraffe
above an airplane--these failures become even more pronounced. Existing methods
attempt to fix these spatial reasoning failures through model fine-tuning or
test-time optimization with handcrafted losses that are suboptimal. Rather than
imposing our assumptions about spatial encoding, we propose learning these
objectives directly from the model's internal representations. We introduce
Learn-to-Steer, a novel framework that learns data-driven objectives for
test-time optimization rather than handcrafting them. Our key insight is to
train a lightweight classifier that decodes spatial relationships from the
diffusion model's cross-attention maps, then deploy this classifier as a
learned loss function during inference. Training such classifiers poses a
surprising challenge: they can take shortcuts by detecting linguistic traces
rather than learning true spatial patterns. We solve this with a dual-inversion
strategy that enforces geometric understanding. Our method dramatically
improves spatial accuracy: from 0.20 to 0.61 on FLUX.1-dev and from 0.07 to
0.54 on SD2.1 across standard benchmarks. Moreover, our approach generalizes to
multiple relations and significantly improves accuracy.

Motivation: To introduce new evaluation methods for artificial models by leveraging tasks embedded in human creativity, specifically using board games.

Method: The authors test CLIP's capabilities in color perception and naming by using the board game 'Hues & Cues' as a medium for evaluation.

Result: CLIP demonstrates general alignment with human behavior but reveals cultural biases and difficulties with abstraction levels that standard benchmarks miss.

Conclusion: Board games are effective for highlighting certain deficiencies in artificial models and provide insights beyond conventional testing methods.

Abstract: Playing games is inherently human, and a lot of games are created to
challenge different human characteristics. However, these tasks are often left
out when evaluating the human-like nature of artificial models. The objective
of this work is proposing a new approach to evaluate artificial models via
board games. To this effect, we test the color perception and color naming
capabilities of CLIP by playing the board game Hues & Cues and assess its
alignment with humans. Our experiments show that CLIP is generally well aligned
with human observers, but our approach brings to light certain cultural biases
and inconsistencies when dealing with different abstraction levels that are
hard to identify with other testing strategies. Our findings indicate that
assessing models with different tasks like board games can make certain
deficiencies in the models stand out in ways that are difficult to test with
the commonly used benchmarks.

### [428] [OmniActor: A Generalist GUI and Embodied Agent for 2D&3D Worlds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02322)
*Longrong Yang,Zhixiong Zeng,Yufeng Zhong,Jing Huang,Liming Zheng,Lei Chen,Haibo Qiu,Zequn Qin,Lin Ma,Xi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces OmniActor, a multimodal agent designed to handle both GUI and embodied tasks, addressing data conflicts through a novel architecture to achieve superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal agents struggle with executing tasks that interleave interactions between 2D GUI environments and 3D embodied scenarios due to data conflicts during training.

Method: OmniActor employs a Layer-heterogeneity MoE (Mixture of Experts) architecture, sharing shallow-layer parameters for synergy and separating deep-layer parameters to minimize data conflicts. It also unifies action spaces for GUI and embodied tasks and collects large-scale data from various sources.

Result: OmniActor surpasses agents trained only on GUI or embodied data in their respective tasks by leveraging both GUI and embodied data effectively.

Conclusion: The proposed OmniActor successfully addresses the challenges of synergy and conflict within multimodal agents, offering enhanced performance in diverse scenarios, particularly in GUI tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models are evolving toward multimodal agents
capable of proactively executing tasks. Most agent research focuses on GUI or
embodied scenarios, which correspond to agents interacting with 2D virtual
worlds or 3D real worlds, respectively. However, many complex tasks typically
require agents to interleavely interact with these two types of environment. We
initially mix GUI and embodied data to train, but find the performance
degeneration brought by the data conflict. Further analysis reveals that GUI
and embodied data exhibit synergy and conflict at the shallow and deep layers,
respectively, which resembles the cerebrum-cerebellum mechanism in the human
brain. To this end, we propose a high-performance generalist agent OmniActor,
designed from both structural and data perspectives. First, we propose
Layer-heterogeneity MoE to eliminate the conflict between GUI and embodied data
by separating deep-layer parameters, while leverage their synergy by sharing
shallow-layer parameters. By successfully leveraging the synergy and
eliminating the conflict, OmniActor outperforms agents only trained by GUI or
embodied data in GUI or embodied tasks. Furthermore, we unify the action spaces
of GUI and embodied tasks, and collect large-scale GUI and embodied data from
various sources for training. This significantly improves OmniActor under
different scenarios, especially in GUI tasks. The code will be publicly
available.

### [429] [Ordinal Adaptive Correction: A Data-Centric Approach to Ordinal Image Classification with Noisy Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02351)
*Alireza Sedighi Moghaddam,Mohammad Reza Mohammadi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ORDAC, a method to detect and correct label noise in ordinal image classification tasks, improving performance significantly even under noisy conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of label noise in ordinal image classification, which degrades model performance and reliability.

Method: ORDAC uses Label Distribution Learning (LDL) to adaptively correct noisy labels during training by dynamically adjusting the mean and standard deviation of label distributions, utilizing the full dataset instead of discarding noisy samples.

Result: Evaluation on benchmark datasets (Adience and Diabetic Retinopathy) shows substantial improvements in model metrics, especially in scenarios with heavy label noise.

Conclusion: Adaptive label correction improves robustness and accuracy in ordinal classification, making it useful for datasets with inherent noise.

Abstract: Labeled data is a fundamental component in training supervised deep learning
models for computer vision tasks. However, the labeling process, especially for
ordinal image classification where class boundaries are often ambiguous, is
prone to error and noise. Such label noise can significantly degrade the
performance and reliability of machine learning models. This paper addresses
the problem of detecting and correcting label noise in ordinal image
classification tasks. To this end, a novel data-centric method called ORDinal
Adaptive Correction (ORDAC) is proposed for adaptive correction of noisy
labels. The proposed approach leverages the capabilities of Label Distribution
Learning (LDL) to model the inherent ambiguity and uncertainty present in
ordinal labels. During training, ORDAC dynamically adjusts the mean and
standard deviation of the label distribution for each sample. Rather than
discarding potentially noisy samples, this approach aims to correct them and
make optimal use of the entire training dataset. The effectiveness of the
proposed method is evaluated on benchmark datasets for age estimation (Adience)
and disease severity detection (Diabetic Retinopathy) under various asymmetric
Gaussian noise scenarios. Results show that ORDAC and its extended versions
(ORDAC_C and ORDAC_R) lead to significant improvements in model performance.
For instance, on the Adience dataset with 40% noise, ORDAC_R reduced the mean
absolute error from 0.86 to 0.62 and increased the recall metric from 0.37 to
0.49. The method also demonstrated its effectiveness in correcting intrinsic
noise present in the original datasets. This research indicates that adaptive
label correction using label distributions is an effective strategy to enhance
the robustness and accuracy of ordinal classification models in the presence of
noisy data.

*Zeren Xiong,Zikun Chen,Zedong Zhang,Xiang Li,Ying Tai,Jian Yang,Jun Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method for synthesizing 3D objects by blending a 3D model with another object's description. It tackles challenges like texture inconsistency and shape inaccuracies, yielding coherent 3D creations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of existing methods that struggle with blending multiple sources for 3D synthesis, often leading to inconsistent textures and inaccurate shapes.

Method: The proposed C33D method combines multi-view rendering of input 3D models with adaptive text-image harmony (ATIH) and multi-view diffusion techniques for textures and shapes. Outputs are then used to reconstruct the final 3D model.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that C33D effectively creates novel and structurally coherent 3D models, showcasing examples like a shark composited with crocodile features.

Conclusion: The approach successfully overcomes challenges in 3D object synthesis, offering a promising tool for producing high-quality, structurally consistent 3D models.

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle a new task of 3D object synthesis, where a 3D model
is composited with another object category to create a novel 3D model. However,
most existing text/image/3D-to-3D methods struggle to effectively integrate
multiple content sources, often resulting in inconsistent textures and
inaccurate shapes. To overcome these challenges, we propose a straightforward
yet powerful approach, category+3D-to-3D (C33D), for generating novel and
structurally coherent 3D models. Our method begins by rendering multi-view
images and normal maps from the input 3D model, then generating a novel 2D
object using adaptive text-image harmony (ATIH) with the front-view image and a
text description from another object category as inputs. To ensure texture
consistency, we introduce texture multi-view diffusion, which refines the
textures of the remaining multi-view RGB images based on the novel 2D object.
For enhanced shape accuracy, we propose shape multi-view diffusion to improve
the 2D shapes of both the multi-view RGB images and the normal maps, also
conditioned on the novel 2D object. Finally, these outputs are used to
reconstruct a complete and novel 3D model. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method, yielding impressive 3D creations, such as
shark(3D)-crocodile(text) in the first row of Fig. 1. A project page is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study evaluates the spatial reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) across three scenarios (single-view, multi-view, and video) using a benchmark named MulSeT, revealing their limitations and suggesting improvements via data scaling and architectural tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of comprehensive and systematic evaluation of spatial understanding limitations in MLLMs, essential for perception, reasoning, and planning in embodied environments.

Method: The study introduces the MulSeT benchmark, coupled with experiments analyzing spatial reasoning across three scenarios, focusing on data scalability and architectural roles (e.g., positional encoding).

Result: MLLMs' spatial understanding saturates with increased training data, with inherent limitations especially in tasks requiring spatial imagination, heavily relying on positional encoding within the visual encoder.

Conclusion: Current progress highlights the challenges and architectural dependencies of MLLMs in spatial reasoning, emphasizing the need for data and architectural innovations to surmount existing limitations.

Abstract: Spatial understanding is essential for Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) to support perception, reasoning, and planning in embodied
environments. Despite recent progress, existing studies reveal that MLLMs still
struggle with spatial understanding. However, existing research lacks a
comprehensive and systematic evaluation of these limitations, often restricted
to isolated scenarios, such as single-view or video. In this work, we present a
systematic analysis of spatial understanding from both data and architectural
perspectives across three representative scenarios: single-view, multi-view,
and video. We propose a benchmark named MulSeT (Multi-view Spatial
Understanding Tasks), and design a series of experiments to analyze the spatial
reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. From the data perspective, the performance of
spatial understanding converges quickly as the training data increases, and the
upper bound is relatively low, especially for tasks that require spatial
imagination. This indicates that merely expanding training data is insufficient
to achieve satisfactory performance. From the architectural perspective, we
find that spatial understanding relies more heavily on the positional encoding
within the visual encoder than within the language model, in both cascaded and
native MLLMs. Moreover, we explore reasoning injection and envision future
improvements through architectural design to optimize spatial understanding.
These insights shed light on the limitations of current MLLMs and suggest new
directions for improving spatial reasoning capabilities through data scaling
and architectural tuning.

*Yuheng Li,Yizhou Wu,Yuxiang Lai,Mingzhe Hu,Xiaofeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MedDINOv3, a new framework for employing foundation models to achieve state-of-the-art medical image segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image segmentation is crucial for diagnosis and treatment, but current models are often limited to specific tasks and struggle with adapting to different modalities and institutions.

Method: The authors adapt the DINOv3 vision foundation model to medical images by enhancing ViT backbones with multi-scale token aggregation and conducting domain-adaptive pretraining on a large CT dataset.

Result: MedDINOv3 achieves or surpasses state-of-the-art performance on four medical image segmentation benchmarks.

Conclusion: MedDINOv3 demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of using vision foundation models as generalized segmentation solutions for medical imaging.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of organs and tumors in CT and MRI scans is essential
for diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. While deep learning
has advanced automated segmentation, most models remain task-specific, lacking
generalizability across modalities and institutions. Vision foundation models
(FMs) pretrained on billion-scale natural images offer powerful and
transferable representations. However, adapting them to medical imaging faces
two key challenges: (1) the ViT backbone of most foundation models still
underperform specialized CNNs on medical image segmentation, and (2) the large
domain gap between natural and medical images limits transferability. We
introduce \textbf{MedDINOv3}, a simple and effective framework for adapting
DINOv3 to medical segmentation. We first revisit plain ViTs and design a simple
and effective architecture with multi-scale token aggregation. Then, we perform
domain-adaptive pretraining on \textbf{CT-3M}, a curated collection of 3.87M
axial CT slices, using a multi-stage DINOv3 recipe to learn robust dense
features. MedDINOv3 matches or exceeds state-of-the-art performance across four
segmentation benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of vision foundation
models as unified backbones for medical image segmentation. The code is

*Xiaobao Wei,Changyong Shu,Zhaokun Yue,Chang Huang,Weiwei Liu,Shuai Yang,Lirong Yang,Peng Gao,Wenbin Zhang,Gaochao Zhu,Chengxiang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DBStereo, a real-time stereo matching network that utilizes pure 2D convolutions for cost aggregation, achieving both high performance and accuracy while being deployment-friendly for mobile devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current high-performance stereo matching methods depend heavily on 3D cost volume regularization, which is resource-intensive and unsuitable for mobile devices. Meanwhile, 2D regularization methods struggle in challenging regions.

Method: The authors designed DBStereo with a lightweight bidirectional geometry aggregation block leveraging pure 2D convolutions, and employed decoupled learning to model spatial and disparity representations effectively.

Result: DBStereo outperformed existing aggregation-based methods in inference time and accuracy, and even surpassed an iterative-based method, IGEV-Stereo, in experimental evaluations.

Conclusion: DBStereo challenges the norm of using 3D convolutions for 4D cost volume and sets a strong, efficient baseline for decoupled aggregation paradigms in stereo matching research.

Abstract: High-performance real-time stereo matching methods invariably rely on 3D
regularization of the cost volume, which is unfriendly to mobile devices. And
2D regularization based methods struggle in ill-posed regions. In this paper,
we present a deployment-friendly 4D cost aggregation network DBStereo, which is
based on pure 2D convolutions. Specifically, we first provide a thorough
analysis of the decoupling characteristics of 4D cost volume. And design a
lightweight bidirectional geometry aggregation block to capture spatial and
disparity representation respectively. Through decoupled learning, our approach
achieves real-time performance and impressive accuracy simultaneously.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed DBStereo outperforms all
existing aggregation-based methods in both inference time and accuracy, even
surpassing the iterative-based method IGEV-Stereo. Our study break the
empirical design of using 3D convolutions for 4D cost volume and provides a
simple yet strong baseline of the proposed decouple aggregation paradigm for
further study. Code will be available at

*Tao Wang,Zhenxuan Zhang,Yuanbo Zhou,Xinlin Zhang,Yuanbin Chen,Tao Tan,Guang Yang,Tong Tong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents GSD-Net, a robust neural network model that improves medical image segmentation under noisy annotations using geometric and structural cues, demonstrating significant performance enhancements across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image segmentation heavily relies on accurate annotations, but obtaining high-quality labels is challenging due to cost, time, and inherent noise from subjectivity and coarse delineations.

Method: The researchers developed GSD-Net, which incorporates three novel modules: Geometric Distance-Aware for dynamic pixel-level weighting, Structure-Guided Label Refinement leveraging structural priors, and Knowledge Transfer to enhance supervision and sensitivity.

Result: GSD-Net achieved state-of-the-art results on six datasets, with substantial improvements (e.g., 22.76% on Shenzhen and 8.87% on BU-SUC) under simulated and real-world noisy annotation conditions.

Conclusion: GSD-Net effectively addresses label noise issues in medical segmentation tasks by integrating geometric and structural cues, enhancing robustness and improving model performance significantly.

Abstract: The effectiveness of convolutional neural networks in medical image
segmentation relies on large-scale, high-quality annotations, which are costly
and time-consuming to obtain. Even expert-labeled datasets inevitably contain
noise arising from subjectivity and coarse delineations, which disrupt feature
learning and adversely impact model performance. To address these challenges,
this study propose a Geometric-Structural Dual-Guided Network (GSD-Net), which
integrates geometric and structural cues to improve robustness against noisy
annotations. It incorporates a Geometric Distance-Aware module that dynamically
adjusts pixel-level weights using geometric features, thereby strengthening
supervision in reliable regions while suppressing noise. A Structure-Guided
Label Refinement module further refines labels with structural priors, and a
Knowledge Transfer module enriches supervision and improves sensitivity to
local details. To comprehensively assess its effectiveness, we evaluated
GSD-Net on six publicly available datasets: four containing three types of
simulated label noise, and two with multi-expert annotations that reflect
real-world subjectivity and labeling inconsistencies. Experimental results
demonstrate that GSD-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance under noisy
annotations, achieving improvements of 2.52% on Kvasir, 22.76% on Shenzhen,
8.87% on BU-SUC, and 4.59% on BraTS2020 under SR simulated noise. The codes of
this study are available at https://github.com/ortonwang/GSD-Net.

*Yuhao Wang,Lingjuan Miao,Zhiqiang Zhou,Yajun Qiao,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel framework combining collaborative distillation and self-learning for infrared and visible image fusion using reinforcement learning to enhance model performance with challenging samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the issue of achieving high-quality image fusion with lightweight models, which remains a challenge despite recent advancements.

Method: Introduces a novel collaborative distillation and self-learning framework, leveraging a reinforcement learning agent to optimize training strategies by balancing student performance, teacher-student gap, and sample difficulty dynamically.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates significantly improved performance of the student model and superior image fusion results compared to existing techniques.

Conclusion: Collaborative distillation and self-learning driven by reinforcement learning provide an effective solution for lightweight, high-quality image fusion, overcoming traditional model challenges.

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion plays a critical role in enhancing scene
perception by combining complementary information from different modalities.
Despite recent advances, achieving high-quality image fusion with lightweight
models remains a significant challenge. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel
collaborative distillation and self-learning framework for image fusion driven
by reinforcement learning. Unlike conventional distillation, this approach not
only enables the student model to absorb image fusion knowledge from the
teacher model, but more importantly, allows the student to perform
self-learning on more challenging samples to enhance its capabilities.
Particularly, in our framework, a reinforcement learning agent explores and
identifies a more suitable training strategy for the student.The agent takes
both the student's performance and the teacher-student gap as inputs, which
leads to the generation of challenging samples to facilitate the student's
self-learning. Simultaneously, it dynamically adjusts the teacher's guidance
strength based on the student's state to optimize the knowledge transfer.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method can significantly improve
student performance and achieve better fusion results compared to existing
techniques.

*Lydia Kin Ching Chau,Zhi Yu,Ruo Wei Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for real-time virtual makeup try-on that ensures high-quality, temporally consistent cosmetic transfer while preserving user identity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current makeup transfer methods face challenges including identity shift, fairness issues, and lack of temporal coherence or real-time performance, hindering applicability.

Method: The method separates makeup transfer into transparent makeup mask extraction and graphics-based mask rendering. Makeup extraction is enabled by training on pseudo-ground-truth generated using two complementary techniques.

Result: The proposed method delivers temporally stable, identity-preserving makeup transfer results across various expressions, poses, and skin tones, outperforming existing techniques.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses challenges of fidelity, real-time processing, and temporal consistency, making it suitable for practical, live makeup try-on applications.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for real-time virtual makeup try-on that
achieves high-fidelity, identity-preserving cosmetic transfer with robust
temporal consistency. In live makeup transfer applications, it is critical to
synthesize temporally coherent results that accurately replicate fine-grained
makeup and preserve user's identity. However, existing methods often struggle
to disentangle semitransparent cosmetics from skin tones and other identify
features, causing identity shifts and raising fairness concerns. Furthermore,
current methods lack real-time capabilities and fail to maintain temporal
consistency, limiting practical adoption. To address these challenges, we
decouple makeup transfer into two steps: transparent makeup mask extraction and
graphics-based mask rendering. After the makeup extraction step, the makeup
rendering can be performed in real time, enabling live makeup try-on. Our
makeup extraction model trained on pseudo-ground-truth data generated via two
complementary methods: a graphics-based rendering pipeline and an unsupervised
k-means clustering approach. To further enhance transparency estimation and
color fidelity, we propose specialized training objectives, including
alpha-weighted reconstruction and lip color losses. Our method achieves robust
makeup transfer across diverse poses, expressions, and skin tones while
preserving temporal smoothness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach outperforms existing baselines in capturing fine details, maintaining
temporal stability, and preserving identity integrity.

TL;DR: The authors introduce RiverScope, a high-resolution dataset for monitoring surface water, particularly in narrow or sediment-rich rivers, using deep learning and manual annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monitoring rivers and surface water at fine spatial and temporal scales is challenging, especially for narrow or sediment-rich rivers that are inadequately captured by low-resolution satellite data.

Method: The authors developed RiverScope, a high-resolution dataset of expert-labeled river masks, and evaluated deep networks using various architectures, pretraining strategies, and training datasets for river width estimation.

Result: RiverScope achieved a median error of 7.2 meters in river width estimation, significantly outperforming existing satellite-derived methods. The best models combined transfer learning with multispectral PlanetScope channel adaptors.

Conclusion: RiverScope supports fine-scale hydrological modeling for sustainable water management, offering valuable insights for climate adaptation and improving river monitoring accuracy.

Abstract: Surface water dynamics play a critical role in Earth's climate system,
influencing ecosystems, agriculture, disaster resilience, and sustainable
development. Yet monitoring rivers and surface water at fine spatial and
temporal scales remains challenging -- especially for narrow or sediment-rich
rivers that are poorly captured by low-resolution satellite data. To address
this, we introduce RiverScope, a high-resolution dataset developed through
collaboration between computer science and hydrology experts. RiverScope
comprises 1,145 high-resolution images (covering 2,577 square kilometers) with
expert-labeled river and surface water masks, requiring over 100 hours of
manual annotation. Each image is co-registered with Sentinel-2, SWOT, and the
SWOT River Database (SWORD), enabling the evaluation of cost-accuracy
trade-offs across sensors -- a key consideration for operational water
monitoring. We also establish the first global, high-resolution benchmark for
river width estimation, achieving a median error of 7.2 meters -- significantly
outperforming existing satellite-derived methods. We extensively evaluate deep
networks across multiple architectures (e.g., CNNs and transformers),
pretraining strategies (e.g., supervised and self-supervised), and training
datasets (e.g., ImageNet and satellite imagery). Our best-performing models
combine the benefits of transfer learning with the use of all the multispectral
PlanetScope channels via learned adaptors. RiverScope provides a valuable
resource for fine-scale and multi-sensor hydrological modeling, supporting
climate adaptation and sustainable water management.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to automate video compositing using generative models, introducing a novel Diffusion Transformer pipeline and related techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to reduce the labor-intensive and costly traditional video compositing processes by automating them with generative models.

Method: The method involves a Diffusion Transformer pipeline with features like a background preservation branch, a DiT fusion block for dynamic elements, and Extended Rotary Position Embedding for layout fusion.

Result: The proposed approach successfully achieves generative video compositing and outperforms existing methods in terms of fidelity and consistency.

Conclusion: The approach offers a novel, automated solution for generative video compositing, making video production more efficient and customizable.

Abstract: Video compositing combines live-action footage to create video production,
serving as a crucial technique in video creation and film production.
Traditional pipelines require intensive labor efforts and expert collaboration,
resulting in lengthy production cycles and high manpower costs. To address this
issue, we automate this process with generative models, called generative video
compositing. This new task strives to adaptively inject identity and motion
information of foreground video to the target video in an interactive manner,
allowing users to customize the size, motion trajectory, and other attributes
of the dynamic elements added in final video. Specifically, we designed a novel
Diffusion Transformer (DiT) pipeline based on its intrinsic properties. To
maintain consistency of the target video before and after editing, we revised a
light-weight DiT-based background preservation branch with masked token
injection. As to inherit dynamic elements from other sources, a DiT fusion
block is proposed using full self-attention, along with a simple yet effective
foreground augmentation for training. Besides, for fusing background and
foreground videos with different layouts based on user control, we developed a
novel position embedding, named Extended Rotary Position Embedding (ERoPE).
Finally, we curated a dataset comprising 61K sets of videos for our new task,
called VideoComp. This data includes complete dynamic elements and high-quality
target videos. Experiments demonstrate that our method effectively realizes
generative video compositing, outperforming existing possible solutions in
fidelity and consistency.

TL;DR: This paper introduces TeRA, an efficient text-to-avatar generative model employing a two-stage training strategy to outperform previous approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve text-to-avatar generative models by addressing the inefficiencies in existing methods, particularly slow optimization and limited customization, and creating high-quality 3D avatars.

Method: The paper employs a two-stage process: first, a decoder is distilled to structure a latent space using a large human reconstruction model; second, a text-controlled latent diffusion model generates avatars within this space.

Result: The experiments demonstrate that TeRA surpasses prior text-to-avatar models in both subjective and objective evaluations.

Conclusion: TeRA provides a more efficient and superior framework for generating photorealistic 3D human avatars while enabling enhanced customization and eliminating slow optimization steps.

Abstract: In this paper, we rethink text-to-avatar generative models by proposing TeRA,
a more efficient and effective framework than the previous SDS-based models and
general large 3D generative models. Our approach employs a two-stage training
strategy for learning a native 3D avatar generative model. Initially, we
distill a decoder to derive a structured latent space from a large human
reconstruction model. Subsequently, a text-controlled latent diffusion model is
trained to generate photorealistic 3D human avatars within this latent space.
TeRA enhances the model performance by eliminating slow iterative optimization
and enables text-based partial customization through a structured 3D human
representation. Experiments have proven our approach's superiority over
previous text-to-avatar generative models in subjective and objective
evaluation.

*Nabil Jabareen,Dongsheng Yuan,Dingming Liu,Foo-Wei Ten,Sören Lukassen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Anisotropic Fourier Feature Positional Encoding (AFPE), improving Positional Encoding techniques for medical imaging tasks, particularly in anisotropic settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address suboptimal positional encoding approaches in medical imaging, particularly in higher-dimensional and anisotropic image settings.

Method: The researchers propose and evaluate AFPE, a positional encoding method, by benchmarking it against other commonly used encodings across various medical imaging classification and regression tasks.

Result: AFPE significantly outperforms other positional encodings in dealing with anisotropic data settings across chest X-rays, CT images, and echocardiography.

Conclusion: In medical imaging, optimal performance requires selecting a positional encoding that suits the anisotropy and shape characteristics of the data. AFPE provides superior results in anisotropic conditions.

Abstract: The adoption of Transformer-based architectures in the medical domain is
growing rapidly. In medical imaging, the analysis of complex shapes - such as
organs, tissues, or other anatomical structures - combined with the often
anisotropic nature of high-dimensional images complicates these adaptations. In
this study, we critically examine the role of Positional Encodings (PEs),
arguing that commonly used approaches may be suboptimal for the specific
challenges of medical imaging. Sinusoidal Positional Encodings (SPEs) have
proven effective in vision tasks, but they struggle to preserve Euclidean
distances in higher-dimensional spaces. Isotropic Fourier Feature Positional
Encodings (IFPEs) have been proposed to better preserve Euclidean distances,
but they lack the ability to account for anisotropy in images. To address these
limitations, we propose Anisotropic Fourier Feature Positional Encoding (AFPE),
a generalization of IFPE that incorporates anisotropic, class-specific, and
domain-specific spatial dependencies. We systematically benchmark AFPE against
commonly used PEs on multi-label classification in chest X-rays, organ
classification in CT images, and ejection fraction regression in
echocardiography. Our results demonstrate that choosing the correct PE can
significantly improve model performance. We show that the optimal PE depends on
the shape of the structure of interest and the anisotropy of the data. Finally,
our proposed AFPE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art PEs in all tested
anisotropic settings. We conclude that, in anisotropic medical images and
videos, it is of paramount importance to choose an anisotropic PE that fits the
data and the shape of interest.

*Shanjid Hasan Nishat,Srabonti Deb,Mohiuddin Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a lightweight framework for fitness movement recognition that combines 2D CNNs with LSTM and spatial attention, achieving high accuracy with reduced computational demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of computationally intensive 3D models in fitness movement recognition and provide a real-time, resource-efficient approach for health and activity monitoring.

Method: Integrates pre-trained 2D CNNs (e.g., ResNet50, EfficientNet, Vision Transformers) with LSTM enhanced by spatial attention for video-based exercise classification.

Result: Achieved peak accuracy of 93.34% on the UCF101 dataset using the ResNet50-based configuration, outperforming several state-of-the-art HAR systems.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully balances efficiency and accuracy in fitness activity recognition, offering scalable solutions for health monitoring applications.

Abstract: Fitness movement recognition, a focused subdomain of human activity
recognition (HAR), plays a vital role in health monitoring, rehabilitation, and
personalized fitness training by enabling automated exercise classification
from video data. However, many existing deep learning approaches rely on
computationally intensive 3D models, limiting their feasibility in real-time or
resource-constrained settings. In this paper, we present a lightweight and
effective framework that integrates pre-trained 2D Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) such as ResNet50, EfficientNet, and Vision Transformers (ViT)
with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network enhanced by spatial attention.
These models efficiently extract spatial features while the LSTM captures
temporal dependencies, and the attention mechanism emphasizes informative
segments. We evaluate the framework on a curated subset of the UCF101 dataset,
achieving a peak accuracy of 93.34\% with the ResNet50-based configuration.
Comparative results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over several
state-of-the-art HAR systems. The proposed method offers a scalable and
real-time-capable solution for fitness activity recognition with broader
applications in vision-based health and activity monitoring.

### [442] [Mix-modal Federated Learning for MRI Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02541)
*Guyue Hu,Siyuan Song,Jingpeng Sun,Zhe Jin,Chenglong Li,Jin Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in MRI image segmentation under decentralized and mixed-modality scenarios by introducing a novel federated learning framework called MDM-MixMFL, which overcomes data and modality heterogeneity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing centralized multimodal segmentation methods struggle to handle decentralized and mixed-modality scenarios typical in distributed medical settings, like hospitals.

Method: They propose MDM-MixMFL, which features a modality decoupling strategy for separating shared and tailored modality information, and a modality memorizing mechanism to handle incomplete modalities.

Result: Their approach demonstrated effectiveness and superiority through experiments on two public datasets for MRI image segmentation.

Conclusion: MDM-MixMFL enables stable and adaptive handling of modality and data heterogeneity in decentralized settings, advancing MRI image segmentation techniques.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) image segmentation is crucial in diagnosing
and treating many diseases, such as brain tumors. Existing MRI image
segmentation methods mainly fall into a centralized multimodal paradigm, which
is inapplicable in engineering non-centralized mix-modal medical scenarios. In
this situation, each distributed client (hospital) processes multiple mixed MRI
modalities, and the modality set and image data for each client are diverse,
suffering from extensive client-wise modality heterogeneity and data
heterogeneity. In this paper, we first formulate non-centralized mix-modal MRI
image segmentation as a new paradigm for federated learning (FL) that involves
multiple modalities, called mix-modal federated learning (MixMFL). It
distinguishes from existing multimodal federating learning (MulMFL) and
cross-modal federating learning (CroMFL) paradigms. Then, we proposed a novel
modality decoupling and memorizing mix-modal federated learning framework
(MDM-MixMFL) for MRI image segmentation, which is characterized by a modality
decoupling strategy and a modality memorizing mechanism. Specifically, the
modality decoupling strategy disentangles each modality into modality-tailored
and modality-shared information. During mix-modal federated updating,
corresponding modality encoders undergo tailored and shared updating,
respectively. It facilitates stable and adaptive federating aggregation of
heterogeneous data and modalities from distributed clients. Besides, the
modality memorizing mechanism stores client-shared modality prototypes
dynamically refreshed from every modality-tailored encoder to compensate for
incomplete modalities in each local client. It further benefits modality
aggregation and fusion processes during mixmodal federated learning. Extensive
experiments on two public datasets for MRI image segmentation demonstrate the
effectiveness and superiority of our methods.

*Xinrui Gong,Oliver Hahn,Christoph Reich,Krishnakant Singh,Simone Schaub-Meyer,Daniel Cremers,Stefan Roth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MR-DINOSAUR presents an unsupervised approach for multi-object discovery, refining self-supervised methods leveraging motion segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the reliance on supervised pseudo labels in current object-centric learning methods for unsupervised multi-object discovery.

Method: MR-DINOSAUR extends the self-supervised DINOSAUR model by integrating motion segmentation for optical flow analysis to generate refined pseudo labels, followed by training slot assignments for background and foreground.

Result: The approach showed strong performance in object discovery, outperforming prior methods on TRI-PD and KITTI datasets.

Conclusion: MR-DINOSAUR demonstrates the efficacy of completely unsupervised methods in achieving state-of-the-art multi-object discovery results.

Abstract: Unsupervised multi-object discovery (MOD) aims to detect and localize
distinct object instances in visual scenes without any form of human
supervision. Recent approaches leverage object-centric learning (OCL) and
motion cues from video to identify individual objects. However, these
approaches use supervision to generate pseudo labels to train the OCL model. We
address this limitation with MR-DINOSAUR -- Motion-Refined DINOSAUR -- a
minimalistic unsupervised approach that extends the self-supervised pre-trained
OCL model, DINOSAUR, to the task of unsupervised multi-object discovery. We
generate high-quality unsupervised pseudo labels by retrieving video frames
without camera motion for which we perform motion segmentation of unsupervised
optical flow. We refine DINOSAUR's slot representations using these pseudo
labels and train a slot deactivation module to assign slots to foreground and
background. Despite its conceptual simplicity, MR-DINOSAUR achieves strong
multi-object discovery results on the TRI-PD and KITTI datasets, outperforming
the previous state of the art despite being fully unsupervised.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FastVGGT, a method for accelerating 3D vision models using token merging to achieve faster inference without sacrificing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling 3D vision foundation models to handle long-sequence inputs efficiently remains a significant challenge.

Method: The authors identify bottlenecks and propose FastVGGT, which incorporates a training-free token merging strategy tailored to 3D architectures to eliminate redundant computations.

Result: FastVGGT achieves a 4x speedup over VGGT on 3D geometry benchmarks while maintaining strong reconstruction capability and reducing errors in long-sequence inputs.

Conclusion: Token merging provides an effective and scalable solution for 3D vision systems. FastVGGT demonstrates that architectural adjustments can significantly enhance efficiency in long-sequence input scenarios.

Abstract: Foundation models for 3D vision have recently demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in 3D perception. However, scaling these models to long-sequence
image inputs remains a significant challenge due to inference-time
inefficiency. In this work, we present a detailed analysis of VGGT, a
state-of-the-art feed-forward visual geometry model and identify its primary
bottleneck. Visualization further reveals a token collapse phenomenon in the
attention maps. Motivated by these findings, we explore the potential of token
merging in the feed-forward visual geometry model. Owing to the unique
architectural and task-specific properties of 3D models, directly applying
existing merging techniques proves challenging. To this end, we propose
FastVGGT, which, for the first time, leverages token merging in the 3D domain
through a training-free mechanism for accelerating VGGT. we devise a unique
token partitioning strategy tailored to 3D architectures and tasks, effectively
eliminating redundant computation while preserving VGGT's powerful
reconstruction capacity. Extensive experiments on multiple 3D geometry
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, with 1000 input
images, FastVGGT achieves a 4x speedup over VGGT while mitigating error
accumulation in long-sequence scenarios. These findings underscore the
potential of token merging as a principled solution for scalable 3D vision
systems. Code is available at: https://mystorm16.github.io/fastvggt/.

*Bo Jiang,Taolue Yang,Youyuan Liu,Chengming Zhang,Xubin He,Sian Jin*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces KVComp, a framework managing the memory-heavy key-value caches in long-text generation, showing significant memory reduction and efficiency gains without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently handle long context inference challenges posed by the memory demands of key-value caches in large language models.

Method: Introduce KVComp, combining lossy compression techniques with an integrated system design for efficient memory management and computational throughput during inference.

Result: KVComp reduces memory usage by an average of 47% up to 83% and increases throughput while maintaining model accuracy.

Conclusion: KVComp effectively addresses the memory and computational constraints in long-text generation for large language models, offering practical benefits for inference systems.

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive
potential in various practical applications. However, long context inference
poses a significant challenge due to the enormous memory requirements of the
key-value (KV) cache, which can scale to multiple gigabytes as sequence length
and batch size increase. In this paper, we present KVComp, a generic and
efficient KV cache management framework optimized for long-text generation that
synergistically works with both latency-critical and throughput-critical
inference systems. KVComp employs novel lossy compression techniques
specifically designed for KV cache data characteristics, featuring careful
co-design of compression algorithms and system architecture. Our approach
maintains compatibility with the growing nature of KV cache while preserving
high computational efficiency. Experimental results show that KVComp achieves
on average 47\% and up to 83\% higher memory reduction rate compared to
existing methods with little/no model accuracy degradation. Furthermore, KVComp
achieves extremely high execution throughput, effectively reducing
decompression overhead and, in some cases, even accelerating the matrix-vector
multiplication operation and outperform cuBLAS-based attention kernels with
less data movement.

### [446] [HADIS: Hybrid Adaptive Diffusion Model Serving for Efficient Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00642)
*Qizheng Yang,Tung-I Chen,Siyu Zhao,Ramesh K. Sitaraman,Hui Guan*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces HADIS, a system designed to optimize the efficiency of text-to-image diffusion models by improving model selection, query routing, and resource allocation. This leads to better performance and lower latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the high computational costs and inefficiencies in real-time serving of text-to-image diffusion models due to their complexity and the limitations of fixed cascade configurations.

Method: HADIS uses a rule-based prompt router, an offline profiling phase to generate a Pareto-optimal cascade configuration table, and runtime optimization of cascade configuration and GPU allocation based on specific constraints.

Result: HADIS improves response quality up to 35% and reduces latency violation rates by up to 45× compared to existing systems in real-world workloads.

Conclusion: HADIS effectively enhances the efficiency and scalability of text-to-image diffusion models, proving its superiority over current query-aware serving techniques by balancing response quality and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable visual quality but
incur high computational costs, making real-time, scalable deployment
challenging. Existing query-aware serving systems mitigate the cost by
cascading lightweight and heavyweight models, but most rely on a fixed cascade
configuration and route all prompts through an initial lightweight stage,
wasting resources on complex queries. We present HADIS, a hybrid adaptive
diffusion model serving system that jointly optimizes cascade model selection,
query routing, and resource allocation. HADIS employs a rule-based prompt
router to send clearly hard queries directly to heavyweight models, bypassing
the overhead of the lightweight stage. To reduce the complexity of resource
management, HADIS uses an offline profiling phase to produce a Pareto-optimal
cascade configuration table. At runtime, HADIS selects the best cascade
configuration and GPU allocation given latency and workload constraints.
Empirical evaluations on real-world traces demonstrate that HADIS improves
response quality by up to 35% while reducing latency violation rates by
2.7-45$\times$ compared to state-of-the-art model serving systems.

*Denis Los,Igor Petushkov*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces Aira, an AI-driven tool for fine-grained parallelization of latency-critical applications on SMT cores, demonstrating a 17% performance gain on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Latency-critical applications struggle to utilize CPU resources efficiently due to frequent cache misses and speculative execution issues. SMT technology is often underutilized with these applications, despite its potential for boosting performance through parallelization.

Method: The authors developed Aira, an AI-powered Parallelization Adviser. Aira integrates multiple tools into a coding IDE using Large Language Models. It assists in hotspot detection, dynamic dependency collection, and performance simulation to implement fine-grained parallelization. Relic, a parallel framework, is used to test and implement this approach on SMT cores.

Result: Using the Aira framework, the authors achieved a 17% geomean performance improvement on industrial latency-critical benchmarks.

Conclusion: Aira demonstrates the potential for enhancing latency-critical applications through fine-grained parallelization, making SMT cores more effective for these workloads.

Abstract: Latency-critical applications tend to show low utilization of functional
units due to frequent cache misses and mispredictions during speculative
execution in high-performance superscalar processors. However, due to
significant impact on single-thread performance, Simultaneous Multithreading
(SMT) technology is rarely used with heavy threads of latency-critical
applications. In this paper, we explore utilization of SMT technology to
support fine-grained parallelization of latency-critical applications.
Following the advancements in the development of Large Language Models (LLMs),
we introduce Aira, an AI-powered Parallelization Adviser. To implement Aira, we
extend AI Coding Agent in Cursor IDE with additional tools connected through
Model Context Protocol, enabling end-to-end AI Agent for parallelization.
Additional connected tools enable LLM-guided hotspot detection, collection of
dynamic dependencies with Dynamic Binary Instrumentation, SMT-aware performance
simulation to estimate performance gains. We apply Aira with Relic parallel
framework for fine-grained task parallelism on SMT cores to parallelize
latency-critical benchmarks representing real-world applications used in
industry. We show 17% geomean performance gain from parallelization of
latency-critical benchmarks using Aira with Relic framework.

TL;DR: High-performance computing is employed to improve Alzheimer's drug discovery through parallelized molecular simulations, demonstrating efficiency gains but noting current limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage high-performance computing for more efficient and large-scale molecular simulations in Alzheimer's drug discovery.

Method: The study utilized parallelized workflows for molecular simulations (GROMACS with MPI-OpenMP strategies), along with a prototype for parallel docking using Python's multiprocessing.

Result: Improved runtime and efficiency in molecular simulations were shown, with case studies on amyloid-beta and tau proteins providing biological insights.

Conclusion: HPC has significant potential to accelerate neurodegenerative drug discovery, though challenges like computational cost and data management persist.

Abstract: High-performance computing (HPC) is reshaping computational drug discovery by
enabling large-scale, time-efficient molecular simulations. In this work, we
explore HPC-driven pipelines for Alzheimer's disease drug discovery, focusing
on virtual screening, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulations. We
implemented a parallelised workflow using GROMACS with hybrid MPI-OpenMP
strategies, benchmarking scaling performance across energy minimisation,
equilibration, and production stages. Additionally, we developed a docking
prototype that demonstrates significant runtime gains when moving from
sequential execution to process-based parallelism using Python's
multiprocessing library. Case studies on prolinamide derivatives and baicalein
highlight the biological relevance of these workflows in targeting amyloid-beta
and tau proteins. While limitations remain in data management, computational
costs, and scaling efficiency, our results underline the potential of HPC to
accelerate neurodegenerative drug discovery.

### [449] [DSDE: Dynamic Speculative Decoding with KLD Stability for Real-World Serving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01083)
*Mingyu Yang,Jae-Young Choi,Kihyo Moon,Minsung Jang,Eunjoo Joen*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel training-free framework, DSDE, for dynamically adapting speculative decoding in large language model (LLM) inference, improving efficiency and robustness in diverse workloads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speculative decoding relies on fixed speculation lengths, which is suboptimal for large-batch serving environments with diverse requests. The authors aim to address this limitation by introducing dynamic adaptation mechanisms.

Method: The DSDE framework incorporates a predictive signal based on the variance of Kullback-Leibler (KLD) divergence to assess generation stability, and an adaptive cap on speculation lengths to address decoding inefficiencies caused by outliers.

Result: The proposed approach using KLD-based signals demonstrated competitive end-to-end latency while offering superior robustness across various workloads, particularly excelling in low-acceptance-rate scenarios.

Conclusion: Post-hoc diagnostic signals, such as those driven by KLD variance, are effective for dynamic speculative decoding adaptation. This approach could lead to more robust and intelligent LLM inference systems, marking a significant step in the field.

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates large language model inference, but its
reliance on a fixed speculation length is suboptimal in large-batch serving
environments with diverse requests. This paper explores a new direction for
dynamic adaptation by investigating a novel class of post-hoc, diagnostic
signals. We propose Dynamic Speculative Decoding Engine (DSDE), a training-free
framework built on two primary components: (1) a predictive signal based on the
variance of the Kullback-Leibler (KLD) divergence, which diagnoses the
generation's regional stability, and (2) an adaptive speculation length cap to
mitigate the straggler problem in per-sequence decoding. Experiments
demonstrate the potential of using KLD-based stability signals for dynamic
adaptation. An algorithm guided by these signals achieves end-to-end latency
competitive with leading baselines and exhibits superior robustness across
diverse workloads. This robustness is particularly valuable in challenging
low-acceptance-rate regimes, where the proposed signal maintains its diagnostic
utility. Collectively, these findings validate post-hoc signals as a valuable
component for building more robust and intelligent LLM inference systems, and
highlight a promising direction for future research on dynamic speculation
length adaptation.

### [450] [Ocior: Ultra-Fast Asynchronous Leaderless Consensus with Two-Round Finality, Linear Overhead, and Adaptive Security](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01118)
*Jinyuan Chen*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces Ocior, an efficient leaderless Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus protocol optimized for resilience, communication, computation, and latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing BFT consensus protocols, such as reliance on a designated leader and inefficiencies in processing transactions and achieving liveness.

Method: Ocior employs parallel consensus instances and a leaderless design. It incorporates OciorBLSts, a novel threshold signature scheme for fast and adaptive signature aggregation.

Result: Ocior achieves optimal resilience (tolerating up to t faulty nodes), communication complexity (expected O(n)), computation complexity (best-case O(n), worst-case O(n log²n)), and round complexity (two asynchronous rounds for transactions).

Conclusion: Ocior provides a practical solution for achieving high performance BFT consensus across various metrics, leveraging leaderless operation and instantaneous threshold signature aggregation.

Abstract: In this work, we propose Ocior, a practical asynchronous Byzantine
fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus protocol that achieves the optimal performance
in resilience, communication, computation, and round complexity. Unlike
traditional BFT consensus protocols, Ocior processes incoming transactions
individually and concurrently using parallel instances of consensus. While
leader-based consensus protocols rely on a designated leader to propose
transactions, Ocior is a leaderless consensus protocol that guarantees stable
liveness. Ocior achieves: 1) Optimal resilience: Ocior tolerates up to $t$
faulty nodes controlled by an adaptive adversary, for $n\geq 3t+1$. 2) Optimal
communication complexity: The total expected communication per transaction is
$O(n)$. 3) Optimal (or near-optimal) computation complexity: The total
computation per transaction is $O(n)$ in the best case, or $O(n \log^2 n)$ in
the worst case. 4) Optimal round complexity: A legitimate two-party transaction
can be finalized with a good-case latency of two asynchronous rounds, for any
$n\geq 3t+1$. The good case in terms of latency refers to the scenario where
the transaction is proposed by any (not necessarily designated) honest node. A
two-party transaction involves the transfer of digital assets from one user (or
group of users) to one or more recipients. To support efficient consensus, we
introduce a novel non-interactive threshold signature (TS) scheme called
OciorBLSts. It offers fast signature aggregation, and is adaptively secure.
OciorBLSts achieves a signature aggregation computation cost of only $O(n)$ for
the best case. Moreover, OciorBLSts supports the property of Instantaneous TS
Aggregation. This enables real-time aggregation of partial signatures as they
arrive, reducing waiting time and improving responsiveness.

*Dmitry Yaremus,Jianghai Li,Alisa Kalacheva,Igor Vodolazov,Yury Yanovich*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces a machine learning framework to detect rug pull scams on TON blockchain's DEXs, focusing on analyzing TVL-based and idle-based rug pull definitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the critical need to detect fraudulent rug pull scams on TON blockchain due to its novel architecture and significant user base.

Method: The study develops Gradient Boosting models, analyzing two rug pull definitions (TVL-based and idle-based), and trains the models using fused data from the largest TON DEXs (Ston.Fi and DeDust).

Result: Gradient Boosting models can detect rug pulls within five minutes of trading, with TVL-based models achieving an AUC of up to 0.891 and idle-based methods showing better recall.

Conclusion: The framework offers an effective early-warning tool for investors and emphasizes the importance of platform-aware models for TON DeFi security.

Abstract: This paper presents a machine learning framework for the early detection of
rug pull scams on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) within The Open Network (TON)
blockchain. TON's unique architecture, characterized by asynchronous execution
and a massive web2 user base from Telegram, presents a novel and critical
environment for fraud analysis. We conduct a comprehensive study on the two
largest TON DEXs, Ston.Fi and DeDust, fusing data from both platforms to train
our models. A key contribution is the implementation and comparative analysis
of two distinct rug pull definitions--TVL-based (a catastrophic liquidity
withdrawal) and idle-based (a sudden cessation of all trading activity)--within
a single, unified study. We demonstrate that Gradient Boosting models can
effectively identify rug pulls within the first five minutes of trading, with
the TVL-based method achieving superior AUC (up to 0.891) while the idle-based
method excels at recall. Our analysis reveals that while feature sets are
consistent across exchanges, their underlying distributions differ
significantly, challenging straightforward data fusion and highlighting the
need for robust, platform-aware models. This work provides a crucial
early-warning mechanism for investors and enhances the security infrastructure
of the rapidly growing TON DeFi ecosystem.

*Sheng Lin,Fangcheng Fu,Haoyang Li,Hao Ge,Xuanyu Wang,Jiawen Niu,Yaofeng Tu,Bin Cui*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces LobRA, a new framework to enhance the efficiency of joint fine-tuning for Transformer-based models by addressing training data heterogeneity issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rise of Transformer-based pre-trained models, the need for cost-effective fine-tuning methods has become critical due to the growing demand for adapting models to downstream tasks.

Method: The paper proposes LobRA, which mitigates inefficiencies caused by sequence length variation and skewness. LobRA employs heterogeneous resource configurations and data dispatching strategies to balance workloads during joint fine-tuning.

Result: Experiments show that LobRA reduces GPU time for joint fine-tuning tasks by 45.03% to 60.67%, demonstrating significant efficiency gains.

Conclusion: LobRA offers an efficient solution for joint fine-tuning multiple tasks by addressing heterogeneity issues, improving resource utilization and reducing computational costs.

Abstract: With the breakthrough of Transformer-based pre-trained models, the demand for
fine-tuning (FT) to adapt the base pre-trained models to downstream
applications continues to grow, so it is essential for service providers to
reduce the cost of processing FT requests. Low-rank adaption (LoRA) is a widely
used FT technique that only trains small-scale adapters and keeps the base
model unaltered, conveying the possibility of processing multiple FT tasks by
jointly training different LoRA adapters with a shared base model.
  Nevertheless, through in-depth analysis, we reveal the efficiency of joint FT
is dampened by two heterogeneity issues in the training data -- the sequence
length variation and skewness. To tackle these issues, we develop LobRA, a
brand new framework that supports processing multiple FT tasks by jointly
training LoRA adapters. Two innovative designs are introduced. Firstly, LobRA
deploys the FT replicas (i.e., model replicas for FT) with heterogeneous
resource usages and parallel configurations, matching the diverse workloads
caused by the sequence length variation. Secondly, for each training step,
LobRA takes account of the sequence length skewness and dispatches the training
data among the heterogeneous FT replicas to achieve workload balance. We
conduct experiments to assess the performance of LobRA, validating that it
significantly reduces the GPU seconds required for joint FT by 45.03%-60.67%.

TL;DR: LiquidGEMM introduces a hardware-efficient W4A8 GEMM kernel, addressing inefficiencies in dequantization using CUDA Cores, and demonstrates significant performance improvements in its experimental evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the inefficiencies of existing W4A8 GEMM kernels and improve LLM inference performance by addressing the dequantization bottleneck.

Method: LiquidGEMM is designed with two primary innovations: "LiquidQuant" for hardware-efficient quantization with fast, overflow-safe dequantization, and an implicit pipeline for overlapping weight loading, dequantization, and matrix operations efficiently.

Result: LiquidGEMM achieves up to 2.90x speedup over state-of-the-art W4A8 kernels and delivers 1.12-1.63x performance gains compared to NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM's GEMM kernels.

Conclusion: LiquidGEMM successfully enhances W4A8 GEMM kernel performance with significant speedups, providing a practical solution for efficient LLM inference.

Abstract: Quantization is a critical technique for accelerating LLM inference by
reducing memory footprint and improving computational efficiency. Among various
schemes, 4-bit weight and 8-bit activation quantization (W4A8) offers a strong
balance between accuracy and performance. However, existing W4A8 GEMM kernels
fall short in practice due to inefficient dequantization on CUDA Cores, which
cannot keep pace with the high throughput of Tensor Cores. In this paper, we
present LiquidGEMM, a hardware-efficient W4A8 GEMM kernel for efficient LLM
serving. LiquidGEMM designs two key techniques: LiquidQuant, a
hardware-efficient quantization method that enables fast, overflow-safe
dequantization using just two arithmetic instructions per four elements; and an
implicit fine-grained pipeline that fully overlaps weight loading,
dequantization, and MMA across warp groups without software synchronization or
redundant memory traffic. Experimental results show that LiquidGEMM achieves up
to 2.90x speedup over state-of-the-art W4A8 kernels and up to 4.94x end-to-end
system-level speedup. Compared to various quantized GEMM kernels in NVIDIA
TensorRT-LLM, LiquidGEMM delivers 1.12-1.63x performance gains, and achieves up
to 1.63x system-level speedup.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a consistent execution model for distributed heterogeneous systems without heavy refactoring, suitable for diverse parallel programming paradigms.

Method: HiCR utilizes a plugin-based approach to abstract device-specific implementations and model minimal operations like hardware discovery, execution, and communication.

Result: HiCR successfully operates seamlessly across a variety of platforms through its abstracted operations.

Conclusion: HiCR serves as an intermediary 'Runtime Support Layer,' aiding efficient system management, compatibility, and broad platform support for parallel programming models.

Abstract: We present HiCR, a model to represent the semantics of distributed
heterogeneous applications and runtime systems. The model describes a minimal
set of abstract operations to enable hardware topology discovery, kernel
execution, memory management, communication, and instance management, without
prescribing any implementation decisions. The goal of the model is to enable
execution in current and future systems without the need for significant
refactoring, while also being able to serve any governing parallel programming
paradigm. In terms of software abstraction, HiCR is naturally located between
distributed heterogeneous systems and runtime systems. We coin the phrase
\emph{Runtime Support Layer} for this level of abstraction. We explain how the
model's components and operations are realized by a plugin-based approach that
takes care of device-specific implementation details, and present examples of
HiCR-based applications that operate equally on a diversity of platforms.

Motivation: The authors aim to solve the open problem of scheduling parallel computation resources for jobs with arbitrary concave speedup functions, which are more representative of real-world workloads.

Result: SmartFill handles resource distribution selectively and offers closed-form solutions for regular speedup functions while remaining efficient for non-regular ones. Numerical evaluations demonstrate its superiority over heSRPT.

Conclusion: The SmartFill Algorithm advances scheduling in cloud and edge computing by ensuring efficient, optimal resource allocation for a variety of real-world job workloads.

Abstract: Efficient scheduling of parallel computation resources across multiple jobs
is a fundamental problem in modern cloud/edge computing systems for many
AI-based applications. Allocating more resources to a job accelerates its
completion, but with diminishing returns. Prior work (heSRPT) solved this
problem only for some specific speedup functions with an exponential form,
providing a closed-form solution. However, the general case with arbitrary
concave speedup functions -- which more accurately capture real-world workloads
-- has remained open.
  In this paper, we solve this open problem by developing optimal scheduling
algorithms for parallel jobs under general concave speedup functions. We first
discover a fundamental and broadly-applicable rule for optimal parallel
scheduling, namely the Consistent Derivative Ratio (CDR) Rule, which states
that the ratio of the derivatives of the speedup functions across active jobs
remains constant over time. To efficiently compute the optimal allocations that
satisfy the CDR Rule, we propose the General Water-Filling (GWF) method, a more
general version of classical water-filling in wireless communications.
Combining these insights, we design the SmartFill Algorithm to solve the
general scheduling problem. Unlike heSRPT, which always allocates resources to
all active jobs, SmartFill selectively determines which jobs should receive
resources and how much they should be allocated. For a broad class of so-called
\emph{regular} speedup functions, SmartFill yields closed-form optimal
solutions, while for non-regular functions it efficiently computes the optimum
with low complexity. Numerical evaluations show that SmartFill can
substantially outperform heSRPT across a wide range of concave speedup
functions.

*Daoce Wang,Pascal Grosset,Jesus Pulido,Jiannan Tian,Tushar M. Athawale,Jinda Jia,Baixi Sun,Boyuan Zhang,Sian Jin,Kai Zhao,James Ahrens,Fengguang Song*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel streaming compression framework that supports progressive and random-access decompression, optimizing compression quality and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing lossy compression methods for scientific data, particularly degradation in compression quality and speed when enabling progressive and random-access decompression.

Method: The framework uses hierarchical partitioning and hierarchical prediction mechanisms to maintain compression quality and supports both streaming features.

Result: Achieves compression quality comparable to state-of-the-art compressor SZ3 while being up to 6.7× faster.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enables on-demand data access and flexible workflows while offering high speed and compression capabilities, surpassing current solutions.

Abstract: Error-bounded lossy compression is one of the most efficient solutions to
reduce the volume of scientific data. For lossy compression, progressive
decompression and random-access decompression are critical features that enable
on-demand data access and flexible analysis workflows. However, these features
can severely degrade compression quality and speed. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel streaming compression framework that supports
both progressive decompression and random-access decompression while
maintaining high compression quality and speed. Our contributions are
three-fold: (1) we design the first compression framework that simultaneously
enables both progressive decompression and random-access decompression; (2) we
introduce a hierarchical partitioning strategy to enable both streaming
features, along with a hierarchical prediction mechanism that mitigates the
impact of partitioning and achieves high compression quality -- even comparable
to state-of-the-art (SOTA) non-streaming compressor SZ3; and (3) our framework
delivers high compression and decompression speed, up to 6.7$\times$ faster
than SZ3.

*Debraj Banerjee,Santanu Mahapatra,Kunal Narayan Chaudhury*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper presents a new Ising solver that uses continuous relaxation and convex optimization to outperform existing solvers in efficiency and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing Ising solvers, such as sensitivity to cooling schedules and lack of convergence guarantees.

Method: The study relaxes binary spins into continuous variables and designs a new Hamiltonian expressed as a difference of convex functions, which enables efficient and guaranteed convergence algorithms.

Result: The proposed Ising solver achieves superior performance across GPUs, handling problem sizes from $10^3$ to $10^8$ spins, outperforming existing solvers.

Conclusion: The new solver introduces efficiency, scalability, and convergence guarantees, advancing the solution of combinatorial optimization problems modeled by Ising systems.

Abstract: Many combinatorial optimization problems can be reformulated as the task of
finding the ground state of a physical system, such as the Ising model. Most
existing Ising solvers are inspired by simulated annealing. Although annealing
techniques offer scalability, they lack convergence guarantees and are
sensitive to the cooling schedule. We propose to solve the Ising problem by
relaxing the binary spins to continuous variables and introducing a potential
function (attractor) that steers the solution toward binary spin
configurations. The resulting Hamiltonian can be expressed as a difference of
convex functions, enabling the design of efficient iterative algorithms that
require a single matrix-vector multiplication per iteration and are backed by
convergence guarantees. We implement our Ising solver across a range of GPU
platforms: from edge devices to high-performance computing clusters and
demonstrate that it consistently outperforms existing solvers across problem
sizes ranging from small ($10^3$ spins) to ultra-large ($10^8$ spins).

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safe memory reclamation is critical for memory safety in concurrent data structures, with challenges like scalability, usability, and memory footprint.

*Phani Sahasra Akkinepally,Manaswini Piduguralla,Sushant Joshi,Sathya Peri,Sandeep Kulkarni*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper presents an asynchronous decentralized Federated Learning framework with fault-tolerance mechanisms and novel autonomous client termination techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in overcoming bottlenecks, failure points, and inefficiencies of traditional centralized and synchronous Federated Learning architectures.

Method: The paper introduces a two-phase approach: Phase 1 develops an asynchronous FL framework, while Phase 2 integrates fault-tolerance mechanisms and proposes Client-Confident Convergence and Client-Responsive Termination techniques.

Result: The proposed framework allows clients to communicate and update independently, addresses issues like client failures, and ensures meaningful and efficient convergence under asynchronous conditions.

Conclusion: The research concludes that autonomous and asynchronous systems with fault tolerance are capable of offering scalable and reliable Federated Learning solutions in heterogeneous and unpredictable environments.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) facilitates collaborative model training across
distributed clients while ensuring data privacy. Traditionally, FL relies on a
centralized server to coordinate learning, which creates bottlenecks and a
single point of failure. Decentralized FL architectures eliminate the need for
a central server and can operate in either synchronous or asynchronous modes.
Synchronous FL requires all clients to compute updates and wait for one another
before aggregation, guaranteeing consistency but often suffering from delays
due to slower participants. Asynchronous FL addresses this by allowing clients
to update independently, offering better scalability and responsiveness in
heterogeneous environments.
  Our research develops an asynchronous decentralized FL approach in two
progressive phases. (a) In Phase 1, we develop an asynchronous FL framework
that enables clients to learn and update independently, removing the need for
strict synchronization. (b) In Phase 2, we extend this framework with fault
tolerance mechanisms to handle client failures and message drops, ensuring
robust performance even under unpredictable conditions. As a central
contribution, we propose Client-Confident Convergence and Client-Responsive
Termination novel techniques that provide each client with the ability to
autonomously determine appropriate termination points. These methods ensure
that all active clients conclude meaningfully and efficiently, maintaining
reliable convergence despite the challenges of asynchronous communication and
faults.

### [460] [Near-Optimal Stability for Distributed Transaction Processing in Blockchain Sharding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02421)
*Ramesh Adhikari,Costas Busch,Dariusz R. Kowalski*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper addresses stability in blockchain sharding under adversarial transaction injection, presenting both single and multi-leader schedulers with improved guarantees on transaction queue efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure system stability in blockchain sharding under worst-case and adversarial transaction injections, as instability can lead to performance degradation and vulnerabilities like denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

Method: The authors develop a model based on injection rates and burstiness, and propose single-leader and distributed multi-leader schedulers to achieve bounded queue sizes and latency. They describe specific injection rate upper bounds for these schedulers.

Result: The single leader scheduler guarantees stability at an injection rate $\rho \leq \max\{ \frac{1}{16k}, \frac{1}{16\lceil \sqrt{s} \rceil}\}$. The distributed scheduler achieves stability at $\rho \leq \frac{1}{16c_1 \log D \log s}\max\{ \frac{1}{k}, \frac{1}{\lceil \sqrt{s} \rceil} \}$, a significant improvement over prior work.

Conclusion: The proposed schedulers improve upon prior results, bringing the achievable injection rates closer to optimal while ensuring system stability in both centralized and distributed settings of blockchain sharding.

Abstract: In blockchain sharding, $n$ processing nodes are divided into $s$ shards, and
each shard processes transactions in parallel. A key challenge in such a system
is to ensure system stability for any ``tractable'' pattern of generated
transactions; this is modeled by an adversary generating transactions with a
certain rate of at most $\rho$ and burstiness $b$. This model captures
worst-case scenarios and even some attacks on transactions' processing, e.g.,
DoS. A stable system ensures bounded transaction queue sizes and bounded
transaction latency. It is known that the absolute upper bound on the maximum
injection rate for which any scheduler could guarantee bounded queues and
latency of transactions is $\max\left\{ \frac{2}{k+1}, \frac{2}{
\left\lfloor\sqrt{2s}\right\rfloor}\right\}$, where $k$ is the maximum number
of shards that each transaction accesses. Here, we first provide a single
leader scheduler that guarantees stability under injection rate $\rho \leq
\max\left\{ \frac{1}{16k}, \frac{1}{16\lceil \sqrt{s} \rceil}\right\}$.
Moreover, we also give a distributed scheduler with multiple leaders that
guarantees stability under injection rate $\rho \leq \frac{1}{16c_1 \log D \log
s}\max\left\{ \frac{1}{k}, \frac{1}{\lceil \sqrt{s} \rceil} \right\}$, where
$c_1$ is some positive constant and $D$ is the diameter of shard graph $G_s$.
This bound is within a poly-log factor from the optimal injection rate, and
significantly improves the best previous known result for the distributed
setting by Adhikari et al., SPAA 2024.

*Marie Reinbigler,Rishi Sharma,Rafael Pires,Elisabeth Brunet,Anne-Marie Kermarrec,Catalin Fetita*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: PyramidAI efficiently analyzes gigapixel images by gradually focusing on regions of interest, reducing computational demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of processing gigapixel images, which require substantial computational resources, particularly for large-scale and affordable analysis on mainstream computers.

Method: The technique begins analyzing images at low resolution, progresses to regions of interest for higher-resolution analysis, and uses adaptive resolution strategies and computational parallelism validated on biomedical image datasets.

Result: PyramidAI reduced the processed data by up to 2.65x without compromising accuracy and decreased analysis time from over an hour to minutes with modest computational setups.

Conclusion: PyramidAI is a computationally efficient and practical approach for analyzing gigapixel images, leveraging mainstream hardware and scalable techniques for broader accessibility.

Abstract: Analyzing gigapixel images is recognized as computationally demanding. In
this paper, we introduce PyramidAI, a technique for analyzing gigapixel images
with reduced computational cost. The proposed approach adopts a gradual
analysis of the image, beginning with lower resolutions and progressively
concentrating on regions of interest for detailed examination at higher
resolutions. We investigated two strategies for tuning the accuracy-computation
performance trade-off when implementing the adaptive resolution selection,
validated against the Camelyon16 dataset of biomedical images. Our results
demonstrate that PyramidAI substantially decreases the amount of processed data
required for analysis by up to 2.65x, while preserving the accuracy in
identifying relevant sections on a single computer. To ensure democratization
of gigapixel image analysis, we evaluated the potential to use mainstream
computers to perform the computation by exploiting the parallelism potential of
the approach. Using a simulator, we estimated the best data distribution and
load balancing algorithm according to the number of workers. The selected
algorithms were implemented and highlighted the same conclusions in a
real-world setting. Analysis time is reduced from more than an hour to a few
minutes using 12 modest workers, offering a practical solution for efficient
large-scale image analysis.

*Xinrui Zhong,Xinze Feng,Jingwei Zuo,Fanjiang Ye,Yi Mu,Junfeng Guo,Heng Huang,Myungjin Lee,Yuke Wang*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: QRMark is an efficient method for detecting watermarks in generated images, achieving a significant speedup compared to existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing use of generative models necessitates tools for fast, reliable detection of watermarked images across large-scale datasets.

Method: QRMark integrates QR Code error correction, tiling techniques, and GPU resource optimizations to enhance both detection efficiency and accuracy.

Result: QRMark delivers an average 2.43x inference speedup over baseline methods, preserving accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: QRMark addresses efficiency bottlenecks in watermark detection, showcasing notable improvements in speed and resource utilization for large-scale deployments.

Abstract: Efficient and reliable detection of generated images is critical for the
responsible deployment of generative models. Existing approaches primarily
focus on improving detection accuracy and robustness under various image
transformations and adversarial manipulations, yet they largely overlook the
efficiency challenges of watermark detection across large-scale image
collections. To address this gap, we propose QRMark, an efficient and adaptive
end-to-end method for detecting embedded image watermarks. The core idea of
QRMark is to combine QR Code inspired error correction with tailored tiling
techniques to improve detection efficiency while preserving accuracy and
robustness. At the algorithmic level, QRMark employs a Reed-Solomon error
correction mechanism to mitigate the accuracy degradation introduced by tiling.
At the system level, QRMark implements a resource-aware stream allocation
policy that adaptively assigns more streams to GPU-intensive stages of the
detection pipeline. It further employs a tile-based workload interleaving
strategy to overlap data-loading overhead with computation and schedules
kernels across stages to maximize efficiency. End-to-end evaluations show that
QRMark achieves an average 2.43x inference speedup over the sequential
baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Managing Kubernetes is complex due to fragmented APIs, heterogeneous workloads, and the need for precise configurations.

Method: Deploys modular agents aligned to specific domains, orchestrated by a supervisor utilizing LLMs for workflows and tool synthesis.

Result: Demonstrated 93% success in tool synthesis and 100% reliability across 200 natural language queries; supports Azure demo and local testing.

Conclusion: KubeIntellect introduces a novel, extensible LLM-driven framework for efficiently handling modern Kubernetes infrastructure tasks.

Abstract: Kubernetes has become the foundation of modern cloud-native infrastructure,
yet its management remains complex and fragmented. Administrators must navigate
a vast API surface, manage heterogeneous workloads, and coordinate tasks across
disconnected tools - often requiring precise commands, YAML configuration, and
contextual expertise.
  This paper presents KubeIntellect, a Large Language Model (LLM)-powered
system for intelligent, end-to-end Kubernetes control. Unlike existing tools
that focus on observability or static automation, KubeIntellect supports
natural language interaction across the full spectrum of Kubernetes API
operations, including read, write, delete, exec, access control, lifecycle, and
advanced verbs. The system uses modular agents aligned with functional domains
(e.g., logs, metrics, RBAC), orchestrated by a supervisor that interprets user
queries, maintains workflow memory, invokes reusable tools, or synthesizes new
ones via a secure Code Generator Agent.
  KubeIntellect integrates memory checkpoints, human-in-the-loop clarification,
and dynamic task sequencing into a structured orchestration framework.
Evaluation results show a 93% tool synthesis success rate and 100% reliability
across 200 natural language queries, demonstrating the system's ability to
operate efficiently under diverse workloads. An automated demo environment is
provided on Azure, with additional support for local testing via kind. This
work introduces a new class of interpretable, extensible, and LLM-driven
systems for managing complex infrastructure.

*Avinash Maurya,M. Mustafa Rafique,Franck Cappello,Bogdan Nicolae*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: MLP-Offload is a novel solution addressing the growing challenge of training large language models (LLMs) on limited GPU resources by optimizing multi-tier memory offloading to mitigate I/O overheads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of LLM sizes surpassing the memory capacities of individual GPUs necessitates efficient training methods that minimize input/output (I/O) overheads from multi-tier memory or disk offloading.

Method: MLP-Offload leverages multi-level, multi-path offloading with cache-efficient, concurrency-controlled strategies to optimize the management of optimizer states, specifically focusing on alleviating I/O bottlenecks during LLM training phases.

Result: The implementation of MLP-Offload demonstrated up to 2.5× faster training iterations compared to existing multi-tier offloading strategies on models up to 280 billion parameters.

Conclusion: MLP-Offload effectively mitigates I/O bottlenecks during resource-constrained LLM training, offering significant performance improvements and enabling efficient scaling to extremely large model sizes.

Abstract: Training LLMs larger than the aggregated memory of multiple GPUs is
increasingly necessary due to the faster growth of LLM sizes compared to GPU
memory. To this end, multi-tier host memory or disk offloading techniques are
proposed by state of art. Despite advanced asynchronous multi-tier read/write
strategies, such offloading strategies result in significant I/O overheads in
the critical path of training, resulting in slower iterations. To this end, we
propose MLP-Offload, a novel multi-level, multi-path offloading engine
specifically designed for optimizing LLM training on resource-constrained
setups by mitigating I/O bottlenecks. We make several key observations that
drive the design of MLP-Offload, such as I/O overheads during the update
dominate the iteration time; I/O bandwidth of the third-level remote storage
tier remains unutilized; and, contention due to concurrent offloading amplifies
I/O bottlenecks. Driven by these insights, we design and implement MLP-Offload
to offload the optimizer states across multiple tiers in a cache-efficient and
concurrency-controlled fashion to mitigate I/O bottlenecks during the backward
and update phases. Evaluations on models up to 280B parameters shows that
MLP-Offload achieves 2.5$\times$ faster iterations compared to the
state-of-the-art LLM training runtimes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smart farming requires innovative solutions to address challenges like resource limitations, poor connectivity in rural areas, and data privacy concerns while enabling effective data processing and collaborative learning.

Method: The paper proposes eEnergy-Split, a framework based on split learning that allows collaborative training without direct data sharing. It includes an optimal edge deployment algorithm and UAV trajectory planning strategy to enhance energy efficiency and communication.

Result: The framework reduces on-device energy use by up to 86% compared to federated learning, improves classification accuracy (up to 6.2% for ResNet-18), and decreases UAV energy consumption while achieving up to 17% higher accuracy.

Conclusion: eEnergy-Split demonstrates the viability of split learning in smart farming by optimizing energy, enhancing accuracy, and maintaining scalability and privacy, especially in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Smart farming systems encounter significant challenges, including limited
resources, the need for data privacy, and poor connectivity in rural areas. To
address these issues, we present eEnergy-Split, an energy-efficient framework
that utilizes split learning (SL) to enable collaborative model training
without direct data sharing or heavy computation on edge devices. By
distributing the model between edge devices and a central server, eEnergy-Split
reduces on-device energy usage by up to 86 percent compared to federated
learning (FL) while safeguarding data privacy. Moreover, SL improves
classification accuracy by up to 6.2 percent over FL on ResNet-18 and by more
modest amounts on GoogleNet and MobileNetV2. We propose an optimal edge
deployment algorithm and a UAV trajectory planning strategy that solves the
Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) exactly to minimize flight cost and extend and
maximize communication rounds. Comprehensive evaluations on agricultural pest
datasets reveal that eEnergy-Split lowers UAV energy consumption compared to
baseline methods and boosts overall accuracy by up to 17 percent. Notably, the
energy efficiency of SL is shown to be model-dependent-yielding substantial
savings in lightweight models like MobileNet, while communication and memory
overheads may reduce efficiency gains in deeper networks. These results
highlight the potential of combining SL with energy-aware design to deliver a
scalable, privacy-preserving solution for resource-constrained smart farming
environments.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a hybrid reinforcement learning model enhanced by stochastic Dirichlet distributions and quantum mutation-based genetic optimization for dynamic business budgeting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current budget allocation models fail to handle the unpredictable and nonlinear nature of financial data effectively.

Method: A hybrid framework is proposed, combining deep reinforcement learning with Dirichlet distributions to reflect financial shifts and quantum-inspired genetic algorithms for optimization.

Result: The model achieves remarkable performance metrics with a cosine similarity of 0.9990 and KL divergence of 0.0023, showcasing its effectiveness on unseen financial data.

Conclusion: Integrating reinforcement learning, advanced stochastic techniques, and quantum heuristics offers a promising avenue for adaptive budgeting models in enterprise scenarios.

Abstract: Traditional budget allocation models struggle with the stochastic and
nonlinear nature of real-world financial data. This study proposes a hybrid
reinforcement learning (RL) framework for dynamic budget allocation, enhanced
with Dirichlet-inspired stochasticity and quantum mutation-based genetic
optimization. Using Apple Inc. quarterly financial data (2009 to 2025), the RL
agent learns to allocate budgets between Research and Development and Selling,
General and Administrative to maximize profitability while adhering to
historical spending patterns, with L2 penalties discouraging unrealistic
deviations. A Dirichlet distribution governs state evolution to simulate
shifting financial contexts. To escape local minima and improve generalization,
the trained policy is refined using genetic algorithms with quantum mutation
via parameterized qubit rotation circuits. Generation-wise rewards and
penalties are logged to visualize convergence and policy behavior. On unseen
fiscal data, the model achieves high alignment with actual allocations (cosine
similarity 0.9990, KL divergence 0.0023), demonstrating the promise of
combining deep RL, stochastic modeling, and quantum-inspired heuristics for
adaptive enterprise budgeting.

TL;DR: The study explores using machine learning and large language models (LLMs) to diagnose mental disorders in emergency psychiatric patients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of accurately diagnosing mental disorders, especially during emergencies where visible symptoms may be lacking, highlighting a gap in mental healthcare.

Method: It involves using data collected from emergency psychiatric patients at a German rescue station, applying various machine learning models, including Llama 3.1, to assess their behavioral patterns.

Result: The predictive capabilities of machine learning models were evaluated to determine their effectiveness in diagnosing unhealthy mental conditions.

Conclusion: Machine learning and LLMs have potential as efficient tools for identifying psychiatric issues in emergency scenarios.

Abstract: Mental disorders are clinically significant patterns of behavior that are
associated with stress and/or impairment in social, occupational, or family
activities. People suffering from such disorders are often misjudged and poorly
diagnosed due to a lack of visible symptoms compared to other health
complications. During emergency situations, identifying psychiatric issues is
that's why challenging but highly required to save patients. In this paper, we
have conducted research on how traditional machine learning and large language
models (LLM) can assess these psychiatric patients based on their behavioral
patterns to provide a diagnostic assessment. Data from emergency psychiatric
patients were collected from a rescue station in Germany. Various machine
learning models, including Llama 3.1, were used with rescue patient data to
assess if the predictive capabilities of the models can serve as an efficient
tool for identifying patients with unhealthy mental disorders, especially in
rescue cases.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel operator learning network for efficiently solving parametric PDEs with minimal noisy data, addressing limitations of current methods like balancing losses and uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome limitations of existing physics-informed neural networks and operator learning methods, such as balancing physics and operator losses, robustness to noisy/sparse data, and lack of uncertainty quantification.

Method: The framework integrates evolutionary multi-objective optimization, replica-exchange stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics for enhanced exploration/convergence, and Bayesian uncertainty quantification through stochastic sampling.

Result: The proposed method outperforming existing approaches in accuracy, noise robustness, and uncertainty quantification was demonstrated via numerical experiments on PDE problems such as Burgers and diffusion-wave equations.

Conclusion: The integration of advanced optimization and sampling techniques into the operator learning network enhances its efficacy for solving parametric PDEs while addressing key challenges of existing methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization for
Replica-Exchange-based Physics-informed Operator learning Network, which is a
novel operator learning network to efficiently solve parametric partial
differential equations. In forward and inverse settings, this operator learning
network only admits minimum requirement of noisy observational data. While
physics-informed neural networks and operator learning approaches such as Deep
Operator Networks and Fourier Neural Operators offer promising alternatives to
traditional numerical solvers, they struggle with balancing operator and
physics losses, maintaining robustness under noisy or sparse data, and
providing uncertainty quantification. The proposed framework addresses these
limitations by integrating: (i) evolutionary multi-objective optimization to
adaptively balance operator and physics-based losses in the Pareto front; (ii)
replica exchange stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics to improve global
parameter-space exploration and accelerate convergence; and (iii) built-in
Bayesian uncertainty quantification from stochastic sampling. The proposed
operator learning method is tested numerically on several different problems
including one-dimensional Burgers equation and the time-fractional mixed
diffusion-wave equation. The results indicate that our framework consistently
outperforms the general operator learning methods in accuracy, noise
robustness, and the ability to quantify uncertainty.

TL;DR: This paper addresses privacy risks in data lakes for medical datasets and proposes a fine-tuning technique to prevent data exfiltration without harming model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle privacy risks in data lakes where adversaries can exfiltrate sensitive training data embedded in model parameters, posing legal and ethical threats.

Method: Introduce a perturbation mechanism by fine-tuning model parameters using a decaying layer-wise learning rate at export time to corrupt embedded data while preserving utility.

Result: The proposed method disrupts data exfiltration attacks, maintains task performance, outperforms prior defenses, and renders exfiltrated data unsuitable for training.

Conclusion: This strategy provides a practical solution to mitigate data leakage risks, ensuring privacy in medical data models without compromising their utility.

Abstract: Data lakes enable the training of powerful machine learning models on
sensitive, high-value medical datasets, but also introduce serious privacy
risks due to potential leakage of protected health information. Recent studies
show adversaries can exfiltrate training data by embedding latent
representations into model parameters or inducing memorization via multi-task
learning. These attacks disguise themselves as benign utility models while
enabling reconstruction of high-fidelity medical images, posing severe privacy
threats with legal and ethical implications. In this work, we propose a simple
yet effective mitigation strategy that perturbs model parameters at export time
through fine-tuning with a decaying layer-wise learning rate to corrupt
embedded data without degrading task performance. Evaluations on DermaMNIST,
ChestMNIST, and MIMIC-CXR show that our approach maintains utility task
performance, effectively disrupts state-of-the-art exfiltration attacks,
outperforms prior defenses, and renders exfiltrated data unusable for training.
Ablations and discussions on adaptive attacks highlight challenges and future
directions. Our findings offer a practical defense against data leakage in data
lake-trained models and centralized federated learning.

TL;DR: ZeroQAT is a zeroth-order optimization-based quantization-aware training method for efficient and accurate low-bit quantization of large language models (LLMs), addressing the limitations of post-training quantization (PTQ) and standard QAT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the accuracy degradation in low-bit post-training quantization (PTQ) caused by cumulative error propagation and local misalignment, and the impractical costs of quantization-aware training (QAT), such as extensive data, time, and memory requirements.

Method: ZeroQAT employs a zeroth-order optimization approach using forward-only gradient estimation, eliminating backpropagation. It jointly optimizes quantized weights, weight clipping thresholds, and equivalent transformations to minimize quantization errors and manage activation outliers.

Result: Experimental results show ZeroQAT matches the accuracy of QAT while preserving the efficiency of PTQ. This framework offers high-quality low-bit quantization for LLMs without the heavy computational costs.

Conclusion: ZeroQAT provides a practical and efficient solution combining the benefits of PTQ and QAT. It tackles both cumulative error issues and resource overheads, enabling accurate low-bit quantization for LLMs.

Abstract: Quantization is an effective technique to reduce the deployment cost of large
language models (LLMs), and post-training quantization (PTQ) has been widely
studied due to its efficiency. However, existing low-bit PTQ methods suffer
from accuracy degradation because their layer-wise optimization introduces
cumulative error propagation and misalignment between local reconstruction
objectives and downstream performance. While quantization-aware training (QAT)
provides a principled solution, its reliance on backpropagation incurs
prohibitive data, time, and memory costs, limiting its practicality. To address
these challenges, we propose ZeroQAT, a zeroth-order optimization-based QAT
framework. ZeroQAT leverages forward-only gradient estimation to eliminate the
need for backpropagation, significantly reducing computational and memory
overhead while retaining the benefits of end-to-end optimization. Moreover,
ZeroQAT jointly learns quantized weights, weight clipping thresholds, and
equivalent transformations to mitigate quantization error and handle activation
outliers. Experiments demonstrate that ZeroQAT achieves the efficiency of PTQ
while retaining the accuracy of QAT, offering a practical solution for
high-quality low-bit quantization of LLMs.

*Ahmed E. Helal,Fabio Checconi,Jan Laukemann,Yongseok Soh,Jesmin Jahan Tithi,Fabrizio Petrini,Jee Choi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ReLATE, a reinforcement-learned framework to automatically generate efficient sparse tensor representations, achieving up to 2X speedup over traditional formats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges with irregular computations and memory access patterns in high-dimensional sparse data, where current methods relying on expert-defined formats fail to adapt to irregular tensors and variable data distributions.

Method: The paper presents the ReLATE framework, a learning-augmented approach where an autonomous agent uses hybrid model-free and model-based reinforcement learning to optimize tensor encodings. It incorporates mechanisms like action masking and action filtering to ensure correctness and bounded execution time.

Result: ReLATE demonstrates adaptability to irregular tensor shapes and data distributions, achieving up to 2X speedup and a geometric mean speedup of 1.4-1.46X across diverse sparse tensor datasets compared to expert-designed formats.

Conclusion: ReLATE offers a significant performance improvement in sparse tensor processing by autonomously creating optimized tensor encodings that surpass traditional handcrafted formats.

Abstract: Tensor decomposition (TD) is essential for analyzing high-dimensional sparse
data, yet its irregular computations and memory-access patterns pose major
performance challenges on modern parallel processors. Prior works rely on
expert-designed sparse tensor formats that fail to adapt to irregular tensor
shapes and/or highly variable data distributions. We present the
reinforcement-learned adaptive tensor encoding (ReLATE) framework, a novel
learning-augmented method that automatically constructs efficient sparse tensor
representations without labeled training samples. ReLATE employs an autonomous
agent that discovers optimized tensor encodings through direct interaction with
the TD environment, leveraging a hybrid model-free and model-based algorithm to
learn from both real and imagined actions. Moreover, ReLATE introduces
rule-driven action masking and dynamics-informed action filtering mechanisms
that ensure functionally correct tensor encoding with bounded execution time,
even during early learning stages. By automatically adapting to both irregular
tensor shapes and data distributions, ReLATE generates sparse tensor
representations that consistently outperform expert-designed formats across
diverse sparse tensor data sets, achieving up to 2X speedup compared to the
best sparse format, with a geometric-mean speedup of 1.4-1.46X.

Conclusion: This deep learning approach offers a practical and scalable solution for real-time slag flow monitoring, enhancing steel manufacturing reliability and operational efficiency.

Abstract: Steel casting processes are vulnerable to financial losses due to slag flow
contamination, making accurate slag flow condition detection essential. This
study introduces a novel cross-domain diagnostic method using vibration data
collected from an industrial steel foundry to identify various stages of slag
flow. A hybrid deep learning model combining one-dimensional convolutional
neural networks and long short-term memory layers is implemented, tested, and
benchmarked against a standard one-dimensional convolutional neural network.
The proposed method processes raw time-domain vibration signals from
accelerometers and evaluates performance across 16 distinct domains using a

convolutional neural network and long short-term memory architecture, when
combined with root mean square preprocessing and a selective embedding data
loading strategy, achieves robust classification accuracy, outperforming
traditional models and loading techniques. The highest test accuracy of 99.10
+/- 0.30 demonstrates the method's capability for generalization and industrial
relevance. This work presents a practical and scalable solution for real-time
slag flow monitoring, contributing to improved reliability and operational
efficiency in steel manufacturing.

*Can Cui,Zilong Fu,Penghe Huang,Yuanyuan Li,Wu Deng,Dongyan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents SA-DSD, a knowledge distillation framework transferring knowledge from GNNs to efficient KAN models, with enhanced fitting capabilities and reduced resource demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to deploy efficient deep learning models in resource-constrained environments, like smart devices, led to exploring knowledge distillation from GNNs to efficient alternatives, tackling limitations of MLPs in capturing complex dependencies.

Method: Proposed SA-DSD framework, utilizing improved FR-KAN+ models with enhanced fitting capabilities (learnable frequency bases, phase-shift mechanisms), together with adaptive weighting and teacher-student sampling strategies.

Result: SA-DSD showed 3.05%-3.62% performance improvements over three GNN teacher models, 15.61% gains over FR-KAN+, with significant reductions in parameters (16.96x) and inference time (55.75%).

Conclusion: The proposed SA-DSD framework effectively transfers GNN knowledge to KAN models, achieving better performance and efficiency for resource-constrained edge environments, suitable for applications like smart home devices.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is crucial for deploying deep learning models in
resource-constrained edge environments, particularly within the consumer
electronics sector, including smart home devices, wearable technology, and
mobile terminals. These applications place higher demands on model compression
and inference speed, necessitating the transfer of knowledge from Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) to more efficient Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) models. However,
due to their fixed activation functions and fully connected architecture, MLPs
face challenges in rapidly capturing the complex neighborhood dependencies
learned by GNNs, thereby limiting their performance in edge environments. To
address these limitations, this paper introduces an innovative from GNNs to
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) knowledge distillation framework-Self
Attention Dynamic Sampling Distillation (SA-DSD). This study improved Fourier
KAN (FR-KAN) and replaced MLP with the improved FR-KAN+ as the student model.
Through the incorporation of learnable frequency bases and phase-shift
mechanisms, along with algorithmic optimization, FR-KAN significantly improves
its nonlinear fitting capability while effectively reducing computational
complexity. Building on this, a margin-level sampling probability matrix, based
on teacher-student prediction consistency, is constructed, and an adaptive
weighted loss mechanism is designed to mitigate performance degradation in the
student model due to the lack of explicit neighborhood aggregation. Extensive
experiments conducted on six real-world datasets demonstrate that SA-DSD
achieves performance improvements of 3.05%-3.62% over three GNN teacher models
and 15.61% over the FR-KAN+ model. Moreover, when compared with key benchmark
models, SA-DSD achieves a 16.96x reduction in parameter count and a 55.75%
decrease in inference time.

TL;DR: This paper develops a transfer learning framework for predicting minimum operating voltage ($V_{min}$) at advanced 5nm node technology using legacy data and on-chip sensor data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring energy efficiency and reliability in semiconductor manufacturing requires accurate prediction of chip performance, yet $V_{min}$ modeling is challenging due to limited data and complex relationships in advanced technology.

Method: A transfer learning framework leverages abundant legacy data from the 16nm node and integrates fine-grained process variation features using on-chip silicon odometer sensors for $V_{min}$ prediction at the 5nm node.

Result: The inclusion of localized process variation data from sensors significantly enhances the prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses challenges in $V_{min}$ prediction at advanced nodes by integrating legacy data and localized sensor-based input features.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of chip performance is critical for ensuring energy
efficiency and reliability in semiconductor manufacturing. However, developing
minimum operating voltage ($V_{min}$) prediction models at advanced technology
nodes is challenging due to limited training data and the complex relationship
between process variations and $V_{min}$. To address these issues, we propose a
novel transfer learning framework that leverages abundant legacy data from the
16nm technology node to enable accurate $V_{min}$ prediction at the advanced
5nm node. A key innovation of our approach is the integration of input features
derived from on-chip silicon odometer sensor data, which provide fine-grained
characterization of localized process variations -- an essential factor at the
5nm node -- resulting in significantly improved prediction accuracy.

*Cheng Jin,Zhenyu Xiao,Yuantao Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A-FloPS is a training-free framework improving diffusion model sampling by reparameterizing trajectories for enhanced efficiency and sharper results, achieving state-of-the-art performance with very few function evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models exhibit state-of-the-art generative outcomes but confront computational challenges due to their iterative sampling. The paper aims to alleviate these inefficiencies by reformulating sampling trajectories.

Method: The proposed method reparameterizes sampling trajectories of pre-trained diffusion models into flow-matching forms, complemented with adaptive velocity decomposition, enhancing integration efficiency without retraining.

Result: Experiments demonstrate improved sample quality (e.g., sharper images, lower FID scores) and efficiency using A-FloPS, outperforming existing samplers and yielding high-quality results in extremely low function evaluation regimes.

Conclusion: A-FloPS not only improves sampling quality and efficiency for diffusion models but also benefits flow-based generative models, making it a versatile and effective tool for generative tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion models deliver state-of-the-art generative performance across
diverse modalities but remain computationally expensive due to their inherently
iterative sampling process. Existing training-free acceleration methods
typically improve numerical solvers for the reverse-time ODE, yet their
effectiveness is fundamentally constrained by the inefficiency of the
underlying sampling trajectories. We propose A-FloPS (Adaptive Flow Path
Sampler), a principled, training-free framework that reparameterizes the
sampling trajectory of any pre-trained diffusion model into a flow-matching
form and augments it with an adaptive velocity decomposition. The
reparameterization analytically maps diffusion scores to flow-compatible
velocities, yielding integration-friendly trajectories without retraining. The
adaptive mechanism further factorizes the velocity field into a linear drift
term and a residual component whose temporal variation is actively suppressed,
restoring the accuracy benefits of high-order integration even in extremely
low-NFE regimes. Extensive experiments on conditional image generation and
text-to-image synthesis show that A-FloPS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art training-free samplers in both sample quality and efficiency.
Notably, with as few as $5$ function evaluations, A-FloPS achieves
substantially lower FID and generates sharper, more coherent images. The
adaptive mechanism also improves native flow-based generative models,
underscoring its generality. These results position A-FloPS as a versatile and
effective solution for high-quality, low-latency generative modeling.

TL;DR: This paper explores advanced machine learning models to predict, analyze, and synthesize microbial compositions in wastewater treatment plants worldwide.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenges in microbiome engineering by aiming to improve microbiome control, with a focus on understanding microbial compositions in activated sludge systems.

Method: They deploy a backpropagation neural network optimized with differential evolution (DE-BP), a novel clustering algorithm (DPNG-EPMC), and Similar Time Generative Adversarial Networks (SiTime-GAN) for prediction, clustering analysis, and synthetic data generation.

Result: The DE-BP model demonstrated superior prediction accuracy, DPNG-EPMC successfully analyzed wastewater treatment plants under varying features, and SiTime-GAN generated valuable synthetic microbial composition data.

Conclusion: The approaches provide insights into the factors influencing activated sludge communities, advancing microbiome engineering in wastewater treatment plants.

Abstract: Microbiomes not only underpin Earth's biogeochemical cycles but also play
crucial roles in both engineered and natural ecosystems, such as the soil,
wastewater treatment, and the human gut. However, microbiome engineering faces
significant obstacles to surmount to deliver the desired improvements in
microbiome control. Here, we use the backpropagation neural network (BPNN),
optimized through differential evolution (DE-BP), to predict the microbial
composition of activated sludge (AS) systems collected from wastewater
treatment plants (WWTPs) located worldwide. Furthermore, we introduce a novel
clustering algorithm termed Directional Position Nonlinear Emotional Preference
Migration Behavior Clustering (DPNG-EPMC). This method is applied to conduct a
clustering analysis of WWTPs across various feature attributes. Finally, we
employ the Similar Time Generative Adversarial Networks (SiTime-GAN), to
synthesize novel microbial compositions and feature attributes data. As a
result, we demonstrate that the DE-BP model can provide superior predictions of
the microbial composition. Additionally, we show that the DPNG-EPMC can be
applied to the analysis of WWTPs under various feature attributes. Finally, we
demonstrate that the SiTime-GAN model can generate valuable incremental
synthetic data. Our results, obtained through predicting the microbial
community and conducting analysis of WWTPs under various feature attributes,
develop an understanding of the factors influencing AS communities.

*Madhav Kanda,Shubham Ugare,Sasa Misailovic*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces RefineStat, a framework focused on improving probabilistic program generation by ensuring semantic correctness and applying diagnostic-based refinements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small language models often generate faulty probabilistic programs with syntactic and semantic issues. The paper aims to address this problem by leveraging domain expertise and debugging strategies.

Method: RefineStat combines enforcement of semantic constraints to ensure valid distributions and applies diagnostic-based refinement through resampling failed components.

Result: RefineStat was evaluated on various probabilistic programming tasks, showing it generates syntactically correct and statistically reliable programs that rival or outperform outputs from large language models.

Conclusion: RefineStat provides a robust approach for probabilistic program synthesis by improving reliability and aligning results with both domain-specific constraints and statistical requirements.

Abstract: Probabilistic programming offers a powerful framework for modeling
uncertainty, yet statistical model discovery in this domain entails navigating
an immense search space under strict domain-specific constraints. When small
language models are tasked with generating probabilistic programs, they
frequently produce outputs that suffer from both syntactic and semantic errors,
such as flawed inference constructs. Motivated by probabilistic programmers'
domain expertise and debugging strategies, we introduce RefineStat, a language
model--driven framework that enforces semantic constraints ensuring synthesized
programs contain valid distributions and well-formed parameters, and then
applies diagnostic-aware refinement by resampling prior or likelihood
components whenever reliability checks fail. We evaluate RefineStat on multiple
probabilistic-programming code-generation tasks using smaller language models
(SLMs) and find that it produces programs that are both syntactically sound and
statistically reliable, often matching or surpassing those from closed-source
large language models (e.g., OpenAI o3).

### [478] [Exploring and Reshaping the Weight Distribution in LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00046)
*Chunming Ye,Songzhou Li,Xu Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates how the weight distributions in layers of Large Language Models (LLMs) correlate and impact LoRA training. It identifies power-law distributions in weight distances, proposes a simulation-based data generator, and suggests reshaping LoRA weights during initialization to improve training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address how the distributions of weights in different layers of LLMs influence the effectiveness of parameter-efficient LoRA training.

Method: The paper analyzes weight distributions by calculating singular values of weight matrices in self-attention and MLP layers, identifying power-law trends. It introduces a qualitative description of model distributions and designs a data generator combining Gaussian process and Pareto functions. This generator simulates weight data aligning with observed distributions and reshapes LoRA initialization weights for training.

Result: The reshaping method for LoRA initialization weights based on observed distribution characteristics improves LoRA training performance without altering the model structure or training process.

Conclusion: Adapting LoRA weight initializations using insights into LLM layer weight distributions can enhance training effectiveness, providing a novel method to optimize parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models is influenced by their
characteristics such as architecture, model sizes, decoding methods and so on.
Due to differences in structure or function, the weights in different layers of
large models have varying distributions. This paper explores the correlations
between different types of layers in terms of weights distribution and studies
the potential impact of these correlations on LoRA training effectiveness.
Firstly, the study reveals that in the model the cosine distances between
weights of different layers manifest power-law distribution. We extract
Query-projection, down-projection and other weight matrices from the
self-attention layers and MLP layers, calculate the singular values of the
matrices using singular value decomposition, and organize a certain number of
singular values into matrices according to projection's type. By analyzing the
probability distribution of the cosine distances between these matrices, it is
found that the cosine distances values between them have distinct power-law
distribution characteristics. Secondly, based on the results of distance
calculations and analysis across different layers of model, a qualitative
method is proposed to describe the distribution characteristics of different
models. Next, to construct weights that align with the distribution
characteristics, a data generator is designed using a combination of Gaussian
process and Pareto distribution functions. The generator is used to simulate
the generation of data that aligns with specific distribution characteristics.
Finally, based on the aforementioned distribution characteristics and data
generation method, the weights in LoRA initialization are reshaped for
training. Experimental results indicate that, without altering the model
structure or training process, this method achieves a certain improvement in
the performance of LoRA training.

*Lucie Fontaine,Frédéric Alexandre*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates the episodic capabilities of a predictive coding model of the neocortex and concludes that episodic memory can arise from semantic learning but is limited in capacity, highlighting the role of the hippocampus.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether the neocortex, modeled using predictive coding, can exhibit episodic memory capabilities similar to the hippocampus.

Method: A predictive coding model of the neocortex was used to examine its ability to recall details of individual examples, with a focus on the relationship between episodic and semantic memory.

Result: The model can recall specific details when trained on a small set of examples but fails to generalize and loses recall capabilities when trained with more examples.

Conclusion: Episodic memory in the neocortex is constrained in capacity, supporting the need for hippocampal mechanisms for effective episodic memory storage.

Abstract: Complementary Learning Systems theory holds that intelligent agents need two
learning systems. Semantic memory is encoded in the neocortex with dense,
overlapping representations and acquires structured knowledge. Episodic memory
is encoded in the hippocampus with sparse, pattern-separated representations
and quickly learns the specifics of individual experiences. Recently, this
duality between semantic and episodic memories has been challenged by
predictive coding, a biologically plausible neural network model of the
neocortex which was shown to have hippocampus-like abilities on
auto-associative memory tasks. These results raise the question of the episodic
capabilities of the neocortex and their relation to semantic memory. In this
paper, we present such a predictive coding model of the neocortex and explore
its episodic capabilities. We show that this kind of model can indeed recall
the specifics of individual examples but only if it is trained on a small
number of examples. The model is overfitted to these exemples and does not
generalize well, suggesting that episodic memory can arise from semantic
learning. Indeed, a model trained with many more examples loses its recall
capabilities. This work suggests that individual examples can be encoded
gradually in the neocortex using dense, overlapping representations but only in
a limited number, motivating the need for sparse, pattern-separated
representations as found in the hippocampus.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper examines a brain-inspired internal replay mechanism in ANNs to address catastrophic forgetting in continual learning. Testing on CIFAR-100, it mitigates forgetting when paired with Synaptic Intelligence but reduces initial task accuracy, revealing stability-plasticity trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of catastrophic forgetting in ANNs during continual learning, by investigating brain-inspired computational approaches such as internal replay.

Method: The study focuses on internal replay, reactivating latent representations of prior experiences, tested both independently and combined with Synaptic Intelligence using CIFAR-100 in a class-incremental setting. Analytical tools like log-likelihood distributions, reconstruction errors, silhouette scores, and UMAP projections were used.

Result: Internal replay minimizes forgetting, particularly when augmented with Synaptic Intelligence. However, this leads to reduced initial task accuracy and increased representational overlap in latent space, limiting task-specific differentiation.

Conclusion: While internal replay effectively reduces forgetting in ANNs, it introduces trade-offs between memory retention and task-specific learning adaptability, emphasizing the need for further refinement of brain-inspired continual learning techniques.

Abstract: Artificial neural networks (ANNs) continue to face challenges in continual
learning, particularly due to catastrophic forgetting, the loss of previously
learned knowledge when acquiring new tasks. Inspired by memory consolidation in
the human brain, we investigate the internal replay mechanism proposed
by~\citep{brain_inspired_replay1}, which reactivates latent representations of
prior experiences during learning. As internal replay was identified as the
most influential component among the brain-inspired mechanisms in their
framework, it serves as the central focus of our in-depth investigation. Using
the CIFAR-100 dataset in a class-incremental setting, we evaluate the
effectiveness of internal replay, both in isolation and in combination with
Synaptic Intelligence (SI). Our experiments show that internal replay
significantly mitigates forgetting, especially when paired with SI, but at the
cost of reduced initial task accuracy, highlighting a trade-off between memory
stability and learning plasticity. Further analyses using log-likelihood
distributions, reconstruction errors, silhouette scores, and UMAP projections
reveal that internal replay increases representational overlap in latent space,
potentially limiting task-specific differentiation. These results underscore
the limitations of current brain-inspired methods and suggest future directions
for balancing retention and adaptability in continual learning systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the performance of merged models by addressing the hyperparameter tuning challenge, especially for large language models (LLMs), which is computationally expensive.

Method: Develop surrogate benchmarks by defining two search spaces and collecting data to build models that predict merged model performance based on hyperparameters.

Result: The surrogate benchmarks were shown to accurately predict merged model performance and simulate optimization algorithm behaviors effectively.

Conclusion: The proposed surrogate benchmarks provide a low-cost solution for hyperparameter optimization in model merging, facilitating the development and comparison of algorithms.

Abstract: Model merging techniques aim to integrate the abilities of multiple models
into a single model. Most model merging techniques have hyperparameters, and
their setting affects the performance of the merged model. Because several
existing works show that tuning hyperparameters in model merging can enhance
the merging outcome, developing hyperparameter optimization algorithms for
model merging is a promising direction. However, its optimization process is
computationally expensive, particularly in merging LLMs. In this work, we
develop surrogate benchmarks for optimization of the merging hyperparameters to
realize algorithm development and performance comparison at low cost. We define
two search spaces and collect data samples to construct surrogate models to
predict the performance of a merged model from a hyperparameter. We demonstrate
that our benchmarks can predict the performance of merged models well and
simulate optimization algorithm behaviors.

TL;DR: DaCe AD is an efficient automatic differentiation engine that overcomes limitations of existing frameworks, achieving superior performance with minimal effort required by users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for an automatic differentiation engine that addresses constraints like programming language support, performance, and extensive code modification while ensuring efficiency in scientific computing applications.

Method: DaCe AD introduces a novel ILP-based algorithm that balances storing and recomputing forward-pass data under memory constraints to optimize performance.

Result: DaCe AD outperforms JAX, a state-of-the-art AD framework, by achieving up to 92 times faster performance in diverse scientific computing benchmarks without requiring any code modifications.

Conclusion: DaCe AD enables domain scientists to achieve high-performance automatic differentiation without compromising usability or requiring extensive manual intervention.

Abstract: Automatic differentiation (AD) is a set of techniques that systematically
applies the chain rule to compute the gradients of functions without requiring
human intervention. Although the fundamentals of this technology were
established decades ago, it is experiencing a renaissance as it plays a key
role in efficiently computing gradients for backpropagation in machine learning
algorithms. AD is also crucial for many applications in scientific computing
domains, particularly emerging techniques that integrate machine learning
models within scientific simulations and schemes. Existing AD frameworks have
four main limitations: limited support of programming languages, requiring code
modifications for AD compatibility, limited performance on scientific computing
codes, and a naive store-all solution for forward-pass data required for
gradient calculations. These limitations force domain scientists to manually
compute the gradients for large problems. This work presents DaCe AD, a
general, efficient automatic differentiation engine that requires no code
modifications. DaCe AD uses a novel ILP-based algorithm to optimize the
trade-off between storing and recomputing to achieve maximum performance within
a given memory constraint. We showcase the generality of our method by applying
it to NPBench, a suite of HPC benchmarks with diverse scientific computing
patterns, where we outperform JAX, a Python framework with state-of-the-art
general AD capabilities, by more than 92 times on average without requiring any
code changes.

TL;DR: A physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework significantly improves hydrogen sorption predictions in clays, shales, and coals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome limitations of traditional methods such as slow, error-prone processes and insufficient geological heterogeneity analysis in hydrogen storage, exploration, and waste containment.

Method: The research introduces PINN with multi-category feature engineering integrating thermodynamic constraints, deep residual networks, multi-head attention, adaptive loss functions, and uncertainty quantification.

Result: Achieved high accuracy (R2 = 0.979, RMSE = 0.045 mol/kg), faster convergence, robust lithology-specific predictions, and reliable interpretability of interactions among features.

Conclusion: The framework accelerates site screening and supports risk-informed decision-making in hydrogen storage and containment applications.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of hydrogen sorption in clays, shales, and coals is vital
for advancing underground hydrogen storage, natural hydrogen exploration, and
radioactive waste containment. Traditional experimental methods, while
foundational, are time-consuming, error-prone, and limited in capturing
geological heterogeneity. This study introduces an adaptive physics-informed
neural network (PINN) framework with multi-category feature engineering to
enhance hydrogen sorption prediction. The framework integrates classical
isotherm models with thermodynamic constraints to ensure physical consistency
while leveraging deep learning flexibility. A comprehensive dataset consisting
of 155 samples, which includes 50 clays, 60 shales, and 45 coals, was employed,
incorporating diverse compositional properties and experimental conditions.
Multi-category feature engineering across seven categories captured complex
sorption dynamics. The PINN employs deep residual networks with multi-head
attention, optimized via adaptive loss functions and Monte Carlo dropout for
uncertainty quantification. K-fold cross-validation and hyperparameter
optimization achieve significant accuracy (R2 = 0.979, RMSE = 0.045 mol per kg)
with 67% faster convergence despite 15-fold increased complexity. The framework
demonstrates robust lithology-specific performance across clay minerals (R2 =
0.981), shales (R2 = 0.971), and coals (R2 = 0.978), maintaining 85-91%
reliability scores. Interpretability analysis via SHAP, accumulated local
effects, and Friedman's H-statistics reveal that hydrogen adsorption capacity
dominates predictions, while 86.7% of feature pairs exhibit strong
interactions, validating the necessity of non-linear modeling approaches. This
adaptive physics-informed framework accelerates site screening and enables

*David Kurtenbach,Megan Manly,Zach Metzinger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper uses deep learning models to detect anomalous behavior in Russian satellites prior to and during the Ukraine invasion, assessing their potential as early warnings of military actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to identify patterns in satellite activity that could serve as early warnings for military aggression, using historical data to analyze Russian satellite movements.

Method: They applied statistical and deep learning techniques, including autoencoders and an anchor-loss method, to anomaly detection based on five years of data and focused on a period six months before the Ukraine invasion.

Result: The research found statistically significant anomalies in satellite behavior, with detailed insights into changes in specific orbital elements for clearer interpretability.

Conclusion: The model outputs demonstrate that deep learning techniques can uncover actionable intelligence regarding early indicators of aggression, with a focus on both anomaly detection and result explainability.

Abstract: We apply deep learning techniques for anomaly detection to analyze activity
of Russian-owned resident space objects (RSO) prior to the Ukraine invasion and
assess the results for any findings that can be used as indications and
warnings (I&W) of aggressive military behavior for future conflicts. Through
analysis of anomalous activity, an understanding of possible tactics and
procedures can be established to assess the existence of statistically
significant changes in Russian RSO pattern of life/pattern of behavior
(PoL/PoB) using publicly available two-line element (TLE) data. This research
looks at statistical and deep learning approaches to assess anomalous activity.
The deep learning methods assessed are isolation forest (IF), traditional
autoencoder (AE), variational autoencoder (VAE), Kolmogorov Arnold Network
(KAN), and a novel anchor-loss based autoencoder (Anchor AE). Each model is
used to establish a baseline of on-orbit activity based on a five-year data
sample. The primary investigation period focuses on the six months leading up
to the invasion date of February 24, 2022. Additional analysis looks at RSO
activity during an active combat period by sampling TLE data after the invasion
date. The deep learning autoencoder models identify anomalies based on
reconstruction errors that surpass a threshold sigma. To capture the nuance and
unique characteristics of each RSO an individual model was trained for each
observed space object. The research made an effort to prioritize explainability
and interpretability of the model results thus each observation was assessed
for anomalous behavior of the individual six orbital elements versus analyzing
the input data as a single monolithic observation. The results demonstrate not
only statistically significant anomalies of Russian RSO activity but also
details anomalous findings to the individual orbital element.

*Yousuf Moiz Ali,Jaroslaw E. Prilepsky,Nicola Sambo,Joao Pedro,Mohammad M. Hosseini,Antonio Napoli,Sergei K. Turitsyn,Pedro Freire*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper compares pre-, in-, and post-processing methods for tackling class imbalance in failure management for optical networks, noting diverse advantages across methods depending on scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of class imbalance in optical network failure detection and identification, where normal instances vastly outnumber failure cases, and post-processing methods are largely unexplored.

Method: The authors conducted a direct comparative assessment of pre-, in-, and post-processing techniques using an experimental dataset. They evaluated failure detection and identification using methods like Threshold Adjustment, Random Under-Sampling, SMOTE, and Generative AI approaches.

Result: Threshold Adjustment (post-processing) offered the highest F1 score improvement for failure detection (+15.3%), while GenAI methods led to the largest performance gains (+24.2%) for failure identification. Over-sampling like SMOTE excelled in latency-critical, overlap scenarios, and Meta-Learning provided the best results when latency was not a factor.

Conclusion: Different imbalance mitigation approaches excel under varying conditions. Post-processing methods are effective for binary failure detection, whereas GenAI and techniques like SMOTE or Meta-Learning cater to specific scenarios in multi-class identification cases.

Abstract: Machine learning-based failure management in optical networks has gained
significant attention in recent years. However, severe class imbalance, where
normal instances vastly outnumber failure cases, remains a considerable
challenge. While pre- and in-processing techniques have been widely studied,
post-processing methods are largely unexplored. In this work, we present a
direct comparison of pre-, in-, and post-processing approaches for class
imbalance mitigation in failure detection and identification using an
experimental dataset. For failure detection, post-processing
methods-particularly Threshold Adjustment-achieve the highest F1 score
improvement (up to 15.3%), while Random Under-Sampling provides the fastest
inference. In failure identification, GenAI methods deliver the most
substantial performance gains (up to 24.2%), whereas post-processing shows
limited impact in multi-class settings. When class overlap is present and
latency is critical, over-sampling methods such as the SMOTE are most
effective; without latency constraints, Meta-Learning yields the best results.
In low-overlap scenarios, Generative AI approaches provide the highest
performance with minimal inference time.

*Chuanxiang Yang,Yuanfeng Zhou,Guangshun Wei,Siyu Ren,Yuan Liu,Junhui Hou,Wenping Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Tailed Multi-Layer Perceptron (T-MLP) for efficient Level-of-Detail representation in signals like images and 3D shapes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional neural architectures like MLPs operate on a single scale and lack the ability to natively support Level-of-Detail (LoD) signal modeling and transmission.

Method: The authors propose the T-MLP, an extension of the MLP with added output branches (tails) at hidden layers, allowing multi-scale supervision and effectively learning signals at specific LoDs.

Result: Experimental evaluations demonstrate that T-MLP surpasses existing neural LoD methods across various signal representation tasks.

Conclusion: The T-MLP provides an innovative and effective approach for multi-scale signal representation, making it suitable for diverse signal modeling challenges.

Abstract: Level-of-detail (LoD) representation is critical for efficiently modeling and
transmitting various types of signals, such as images and 3D shapes. In this
work, we present a novel neural architecture that supports LoD signal
representation. Our architecture is based on an elaborate modification of the
widely used Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), which inherently operates at a single
scale and therefore lacks native support for LoD. Specifically, we introduce
the Tailed Multi-Layer Perceptron (T-MLP) that extends the MLP by attaching
multiple output branches, also called tails, to its hidden layers, enabling
direct supervision at multiple depths. Our loss formulation and training
strategy allow each hidden layer to effectively learn a target signal at a
specific LoD, thus enabling multi-scale modeling. Extensive experimental
results show that our T-MLP outperforms other neural LoD baselines across a
variety of signal representation tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops a framework combining anomaly detection with explainable AI tools to improve cybersecurity workflows using models like RoBERTa, achieving high accuracy and user satisfaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trust challenges posed by false positives and complex AI model management in the cybersecurity domain, particularly by providing transparent explanations for anomalies.

Method: A framework incorporating visual XAI tools (BERTViz and Captum) and generating natural language anomaly reports based on attention outputs using RoBERTa, DeBERTa, Falcon-7B, and Mistral-7B models.

Result: RoBERTa achieved high accuracy (99.6%) and proved superior to alternative models in anomaly detection on the HDFS dataset, with user feedback affirming chatbot usability and better understanding of anomalies.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances cybersecurity workflows by combining explainable AI tools, high-performing models like RoBERTa, and user-friendly interfaces to improve anomaly detection and remediation speed.

Abstract: Conversational AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) have become powerful tools
across domains, including cybersecurity, where they help detect threats early
and improve response times. However, challenges such as false positives and
complex model management still limit trust. Although Explainable AI (XAI) aims
to make AI decisions more transparent, many security analysts remain uncertain
about its usefulness. This study presents a framework that detects anomalies
and provides high-quality explanations through visual tools BERTViz and Captum,
combined with natural language reports based on attention outputs. This reduces
manual effort and speeds up remediation. Our comparative analysis showed that
RoBERTa offers high accuracy (99.6 %) and strong anomaly detection,
outperforming Falcon-7B and DeBERTa, as well as exhibiting better flexibility
than large-scale Mistral-7B on the HDFS dataset from LogHub. User feedback
confirms the chatbot's ease of use and improved understanding of anomalies,
demonstrating the ability of the developed framework to strengthen
cybersecurity workflows.

### [488] [IMU-Enhanced EEG Motion Artifact Removal with Fine-Tuned Large Brain Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01073)
*Yuhong Zhang,Xusheng Zhu,Yuchen Xu,ChiaEn Lu,Hsinyu Shih,Gert Cauwenberghs,Tzyy-Ping Jung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of motion-related artifacts in EEG signals using a novel approach that incorporates IMU data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG signals often suffer from motion-related artifacts, undermining their utility in real-world applications, particularly for brain-computer interfaces.

Method: The authors propose a fine-tuned model, LaBraM-based correlation attention mapping, which integrates spatial channel relationships in IMU data to identify and mitigate motion artifacts in EEG signals.

Result: Results demonstrate that the new method improves robustness compared to traditional single-modality techniques like ASR and ICA.

Conclusion: Incorporating IMU data significantly enhances artifact removal, paving the way for more reliable EEG analysis under diverse motion scenarios.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive method for measuring brain
activity with high temporal resolution; however, EEG signals often exhibit low
signal-to-noise ratios because of contamination from physiological and
environmental artifacts. One of the major challenges hindering the real-world
deployment of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) involves the frequent occurrence
of motion-related EEG artifacts. Most prior studies on EEG motion artifact
removal rely on single-modality approaches, such as Artifact Subspace
Reconstruction (ASR) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA), without
incorporating simultaneously recorded modalities like inertial measurement
units (IMUs), which directly capture the extent and dynamics of motion. This
work proposes a fine-tuned large brain model (LaBraM)-based correlation
attention mapping method that leverages spatial channel relationships in IMU
data to identify motion-related artifacts in EEG signals. The fine-tuned model
contains approximately 9.2 million parameters and uses 5.9 hours of EEG and IMU
recordings for training, just 0.2346\% of the 2500 hours used to train the base
model. We compare our results against the established ASR-ICA benchmark across
varying time scales and motion activities, showing that incorporating IMU
reference signals significantly improves robustness under diverse motion
scenarios.

*Shang Liu,Jing Wang,Wenji Fang,Zhiyao Xie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SynCircuit is a framework that generates synthetic circuit designs in HDL format, using AI-driven methods to address the data limitations in public IC designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of publicly available circuit design data hindering the development of AI-assisted IC design methods.

Method: A three-step approach: diffusion-based generative modeling, refinement of initial outputs by enforcing constraints, and optimizing logic redundancy using Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS).

Result: SynCircuit generates realistic synthetic circuits, improving ML model performance in circuit design tasks.

Conclusion: SynCircuit effectively tackles the challenge of limited circuit data, providing a method to generate functional synthetic circuits for advancing AI-assisted IC design methodologies.

Abstract: In recent years, AI-assisted IC design methods have demonstrated great
potential, but the availability of circuit design data is extremely limited,
especially in the public domain. The lack of circuit data has become the
primary bottleneck in developing AI-assisted IC design methods. In this work,
we make the first attempt, SynCircuit, to generate new synthetic circuits with
valid functionalities in the HDL format. SynCircuit automatically generates
synthetic data using a framework with three innovative steps: 1) We propose a
customized diffusion-based generative model to resolve the Directed Cyclic
Graph (DCG) generation task, which has not been well explored in the AI
community. 2) To ensure our circuit is valid, we enforce the circuit
constraints by refining the initial graph generation outputs. 3) The Monte
Carlo tree search (MCTS) method further optimizes the logic redundancy in the
generated graph. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed SynCircuit
can generate more realistic synthetic circuits and enhance ML model performance
in downstream circuit design tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to handle the complexities in healthcare data arising from large volumes and heterogeneous sources, which overwhelm clinicians and hinder efficient decision-making.

Method: The paper examines patient data sources like Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) and Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and explores LLM-powered applications for processing and utilizing this data.

Result: Potential benefits of LLMs include improved clinical decision support, better navigation of patient data, and streamlined workflows, while addressing challenges like data integration and privacy.

Conclusion: GenAI, especially LLMs, can effectively tackle clinician data overload and transform healthcare workflows, but critical hurdles must be managed for implementation.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), particularly Large Language
Models (LLMs), offer powerful capabilities for interpreting the complex data
landscape in healthcare. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of
the capabilities, requirements and applications of GenAI for deriving clinical
insights and improving clinical efficiency. We first provide some background on
the forms and sources of patient data, namely real-time Remote Patient
Monitoring (RPM) streams and traditional Electronic Health Records (EHRs). The
sheer volume and heterogeneity of this combined data present significant
challenges to clinicians and contribute to information overload. In addition,
we explore the potential of LLM-powered applications for improving clinical
efficiency. These applications can enhance navigation of longitudinal patient
data and provide actionable clinical decision support through natural language
dialogue. We discuss the opportunities this presents for streamlining clinician
workflows and personalizing care, alongside critical challenges such as data
integration complexity, ensuring data quality and RPM data reliability,
maintaining patient privacy, validating AI outputs for clinical safety,
mitigating bias, and ensuring clinical acceptance. We believe this work
represents the first summarization of GenAI techniques for managing clinician
data overload due to combined RPM / EHR data complexities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study explores AI/ML integration in nuclear reactors for cybersecurity and operational anomaly detection, demonstrating success in distinguishing between different system states but noting the need for further refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The nuclear industry seeks enhanced tools for anomaly detection, system failure anticipation, and operational optimization, but few studies focus on AI/ML applicability in real nuclear reactors.

Method: The researchers introduced a multi-layered AI/ML architecture combining IT and OT data streams to distinguish between cybersecurity incidents and operational anomalies, using real experimental data from Purdue University's research reactor (PUR-1).

Result: The AI/ML system effectively classified normal, abnormal, and cybersecurity-related events, even during complex cyberattacks like denial-of-service. However, data synchronization and collection challenges remain during certain cyber events.

Conclusion: AI/ML shows potential in improving nuclear cybersecurity but requires further advancements for handling intricate event differentiation and complex architectures.

Abstract: There is increased interest in applying Artificial Intelligence and Machine
Learning (AI/ML) within the nuclear industry and nuclear engineering community.
Effective implementation of AI/ML could offer benefits to the nuclear domain,
including enhanced identification of anomalies, anticipation of system
failures, and operational schedule optimization. However, limited work has been
done to investigate the feasibility and applicability of AI/ML tools in a
functioning nuclear reactor. Here, we go beyond the development of a single
model and introduce a multi-layered AI/ML architecture that integrates both
information technology and operational technology data streams to identify,
characterize, and differentiate (i) among diverse cybersecurity events and (ii)
between cyber events and other operational anomalies. Leveraging Purdue
Universitys research reactor, PUR-1, we demonstrate this architecture through a
representative use case that includes multiple concurrent false data injections
and denial-of-service attacks of increasing complexity under realistic reactor
conditions. The use case includes 14 system states (1 normal, 13 abnormal) and
over 13.8 million multi-variate operational and information technology data
points. The study demonstrated the capability of AI/ML to distinguish between
normal, abnormal, and cybersecurity-related events, even under challenging
conditions such as denial-of-service attacks. Combining operational and
information technology data improved classification accuracy but posed
challenges related to synchronization and collection during certain cyber
events. While results indicate significant promise for AI/ML in nuclear
cybersecurity, the findings also highlight the need for further refinement in
handling complex event differentiation and multi-class architectures.

*Laksh Patel,Neel Shanbhag*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a methodology, Generative Data Cartography, to minimize generative models' risk of training data leakage by up-/down-weighting or pruning data based on difficulty and memorization scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the problem of generative models overfitting and unintentionally memorizing rare training data, which may lead to security risks and inflated benchmark results.

Method: Generative Data Cartography assigns a difficulty score and a memorization score to data samples during pretraining, then sorts them into quadrants. This categorization informs targeted data pruning or re-weighting strategies.

Result: GenDataCarto achieved a 40% reduction in synthetic data leakage with just 10% data pruning while maintaining high generative model performance with a validation perplexity increase of less than 0.5%.

Conclusion: Targeted data interventions based on difficulty and memorization metrics significantly reduce generative models' data leakage risks without compromising overall performance.

Abstract: Modern generative models risk overfitting and unintentionally memorizing rare
training examples, which can be extracted by adversaries or inflate benchmark
performance. We propose Generative Data Cartography (GenDataCarto), a
data-centric framework that assigns each pretraining sample a difficulty score
(early-epoch loss) and a memorization score (frequency of ``forget events''),
then partitions examples into four quadrants to guide targeted pruning and
up-/down-weighting. We prove that our memorization score lower-bounds classical
influence under smoothness assumptions and that down-weighting
high-memorization hotspots provably decreases the generalization gap via
uniform stability bounds. Empirically, GenDataCarto reduces synthetic canary
extraction success by over 40\% at just 10\% data pruning, while increasing
validation perplexity by less than 0.5\%. These results demonstrate that
principled data interventions can dramatically mitigate leakage with minimal
cost to generative performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Generative Self-Refinement (GSR), a framework enhancing large language models for solving multi-step reasoning tasks using self-improvement techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing test-time scaling methods, like Best-of-N and majority voting, which fail when all candidate responses are incorrect, and to avoid the deployment costs of using additional models.

Method: The proposed GSR framework has the model generate multiple candidate responses in parallel and then uses self-refinement to synthesize a superior solution. A hybrid training pipeline is designed, optimizing for direct problem solving and response refinement.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on five mathematical benchmarks, with its self-refinement skill remaining robust across model scales and generalizing to out-of-distribution tasks.

Conclusion: Generative Self-Refinement (GSR) is an efficient and model-agnostic approach to scale reasoning skills of LLMs, overcoming common limitations of existing test-time scaling methods.

Abstract: To further enhance the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve
complex, multi-step reasoning problems, test-time scaling (TTS) methods have
gained widespread attention. Existing approaches such as Best-of-N and majority
voting are limited as their performance depends on the quality of candidate
responses, making them unable to produce a correct solution when all candidates
are incorrect. Introducing an additional model to select the best response also
incurs significant deployment costs. To this end, we introduce Generative
Self-Refinement (GSR), a novel parallel test-time scaling framework where a
unified model first generates a set of candidate responses in parallel and then
performs self-refinement to synthesize a new superior solution based on a
prompt consisting of the problem and these candidates. However, LLMs struggle
to perform refinement effectively when prompted directly. Therefore, we design
a hybrid training pipeline by jointly optimizing for two complementary
objectives, solving problems directly and refining candidate responses.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance across five mathematical benchmarks. We further show that this
learned self-refinement skill is a model-agnostic enhancement, robust across
different model scales and generalizing to out-of-distribution reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Learn to Shard," an RL-based method to optimize parallelism and sharding dimensions for efficient LLM inference in distributed systems, achieving notable performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distributed systems for LLM inference face challenges in meeting production SLOs due to inefficiencies in current parallelization strategies, motivating the need for dynamic and adaptive solutions.

Method: The study employs a reinforcement learning approach using an attention-based policy that leverages high-performing strategies stored in an elite history, aiming to optimize parallelism degrees and sharding dimensions simultaneously.

Result: Learn to Shard achieved up to 3.5x throughput improvement compared to metaheuristic baselines and a 1.06x improvement over Megatron heuristics while being evaluated on H100 clusters with large MoE models.

Conclusion: The RL-based "Learn to Shard" method successfully addresses inefficiencies in distributed LLM inference, demonstrating significant performance gains and scalability across diverse models and hardware topologies.

Abstract: Distributed LLM inference requires careful coordination of parallelization
strategies across hundreds to thousands of NPUs to meet production SLOs.
Current systems like Megatron-LM rely on static heuristics that separately
configure parallelism degrees and per-operator sharding dimensions, leaving
significant performance on the table as models scale and hardware topologies
diversify. We introduce Learn to Shard, to our knowledge, the first RL-based
approach to co-optimize both coarse-grained parallelism degrees and
fine-grained per-operator sharding dimensions for distributed LLM inference.
Our method employs an attention-based policy over an elite history that learns
from high-performing strategies to efficiently navigate the vast combinatorial
search space. Evaluated on H100 clusters with MoE models up to 1.6T parameters,
Learn to Shard achieves up to 3.5x throughput improvement over metaheuristic
baselines and 1.06x over Megatron heuristics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study investigates Federated Learning's potential to predict student performance while adhering to Brazilian data privacy laws, achieving near-centralized model accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy concerns and legal restrictions like Brazil's LGPD, which prevent centralized data usage in education, while harnessing AI for personalized learning and early identification of at-risk students.

Method: The study used the FedProx Federated Learning algorithm to train a DNN model across 50 simulated schools, benchmarking it against a centralized XGBoost model using data from over two million students.

Result: The centralized model achieved 63.96% accuracy, while the federated model achieved 61.23%, demonstrating minimal performance trade-off for enhanced privacy.

Conclusion: Federated Learning offers an effective, privacy-compliant way to develop predictive models for educational contexts in line with LGPD requirements.

Abstract: The application of data mining and artificial intelligence in education
offers unprecedented potential for personalizing learning and early
identification of at-risk students. However, the practical use of these
techniques faces a significant barrier in privacy legislation, such as Brazil's
General Data Protection Law (LGPD), which restricts the centralization of
sensitive student data. To resolve this challenge, privacy-preserving
computational approaches are required. The present study evaluates the
feasibility and effectiveness of Federated Learning, specifically the FedProx
algorithm, to predict student performance using microdata from the Brazilian
Basic Education Assessment System (SAEB). A Deep Neural Network (DNN) model was
trained in a federated manner, simulating a scenario with 50 schools, and its
performance was rigorously benchmarked against a centralized eXtreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost) model. The analysis, conducted on a universe of over two
million student records, revealed that the centralized model achieved an
accuracy of 63.96%. Remarkably, the federated model reached a peak accuracy of
61.23%, demonstrating a marginal performance loss in exchange for a robust
privacy guarantee. The results indicate that Federated Learning is a viable and
effective solution for building collaborative predictive models in the
Brazilian educational context, in alignment with the requirements of the LGPD.

*Mojtaba Moattari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper improves LSTM by proposing methods for input reordering, weight normalization based on Lp norms, and introducing nonlinearized gates, which enhance performance in text classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional LSTMs, while addressing long-term dependencies, lack optimality in focusing on specific past information and fail to examine weight normalization and nonlinearized gate mechanisms in detail.

Method: The paper prioritizes input indices via reordering, explores weight normalization using supervised loss functions to determine optimal Lp norms, and introduces nonlinearized gates to emphasize past inputs more effectively.

Result: Proposed approaches were implemented and demonstrated improved text classification accuracy compared to standard LSTMs.

Conclusion: Incorporating input reordering, optimized weight normalization, and nonlinearized gates significantly enhances the performance of LSTMs in text classification tasks.

Abstract: LSTM models used in current Machine Learning literature and applications, has
a promising solution for permitting long term information using gating
mechanisms that forget and reduce effect of current input information. However,
even with this pipeline, they do not optimally focus on specific old index or
long-term information. This paper elaborates upon input reordering approaches
to prioritize certain input indices. Moreover, no LSTM based approach is found
in the literature that examines weight normalization while choosing the right
weight and exponent of Lp norms through main supervised loss function. In this
paper, we find out which norm best finds relationship between weights to either
smooth or sparsify them. Lastly, gates, as weighted representations of inputs
and states, which control reduction-extent of current input versus previous
inputs (~ state), are not nonlinearized enough (through a small FFNN). As
analogous to attention mechanisms, gates easily filter current information to
bold (emphasize on) past inputs. Nonlinearized gates can more easily tune up to
peculiar nonlinearities of specific input in the past. This type of
nonlinearization is not proposed in the literature, to the best of author's
knowledge. The proposed approaches are implemented and compared with a simple
LSTM to understand their performance in text classification tasks. The results
show they improve accuracy of LSTM.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The proposed Collaborative Ensemble Adversarial Training (CEAT) improves adversarial robustness by emphasizing cooperative learning among sub-models, outperforming existing ensemble adversarial training methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of cooperation between sub-models in current Ensemble Adversarial Training (EAT) methods, which reduces their effectiveness against adversarial attacks.

Method: CEAT assigns greater importance to samples with predictive disparities between sub-models, using adaptive weighting and calibrating distance regularization to enhance cooperative learning.

Result: Experiments on various datasets indicate that CEAT achieves superior robustness compared to existing EAT techniques.

Conclusion: CEAT offers a model-agnostic, efficient approach to improving adversarial model robustness, and it can be seamlessly integrated into various ensemble methods.

Abstract: Ensemble Adversarial Training (EAT) attempts to enhance the robustness of
models against adversarial attacks by leveraging multiple models. However,
current EAT strategies tend to train the sub-models independently, ignoring the
cooperative benefits between sub-models. Through detailed inspections of the
process of EAT, we find that that samples with classification disparities
between sub-models are close to the decision boundary of ensemble, exerting
greater influence on the robustness of ensemble. To this end, we propose a
novel yet efficient Collaborative Ensemble Adversarial Training (CEAT), to
highlight the cooperative learning among sub-models in the ensemble. To be
specific, samples with larger predictive disparities between the sub-models
will receive greater attention during the adversarial training of the other
sub-models. CEAT leverages the probability disparities to adaptively assign
weights to different samples, by incorporating a calibrating distance
regularization. Extensive experiments on widely-adopted datasets show that our
proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance over competitive EAT
methods. It is noteworthy that CEAT is model-agnostic, which can be seamlessly
adapted into various ensemble methods with flexible applicability.

TL;DR: The authors present CAEL-MIPS, a new method for improving off-policy evaluation (OPE) in contextual bandits by learning context-action embeddings to minimize mean squared error (MSE).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Variance in Inverse Propensity Score (IPS)-based OPE methods increases with large action spaces or underexplored context-action regions, which calls for improved estimators such as MIPS.

Method: The authors propose CAEL-MIPS, which optimizes context-action embeddings to minimize MSE in MIPS estimators, supported by a theoretical bias-variance analysis.

Result: CAEL-MIPS demonstrates lower MSE on synthetic and real-world datasets compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The proposed CAEL-MIPS effectively reduces errors in OPE for contextual bandits by optimizing context-action embeddings.

Abstract: We consider off-policy evaluation (OPE) in contextual bandits with finite
action space. Inverse Propensity Score (IPS) weighting is a widely used method
for OPE due to its unbiased, but it suffers from significant variance when the
action space is large or when some parts of the context-action space are
underexplored. Recently introduced Marginalized IPS (MIPS) estimators mitigate
this issue by leveraging action embeddings. However, these embeddings do not
minimize the mean squared error (MSE) of the estimators and do not consider
context information. To address these limitations, we introduce Context-Action
Embedding Learning for MIPS, or CAEL-MIPS, which learns context-action
embeddings from offline data to minimize the MSE of the MIPS estimator.
Building on the theoretical analysis of bias and variance of MIPS, we present
an MSE-minimizing objective for CAEL-MIPS. In the empirical studies on a
synthetic dataset and a real-world dataset, we demonstrate that our estimator
outperforms baselines in terms of MSE.

*G. Charbel N. Kindji,Elisa Fromont,Lina Maria Rojas-Barahona,Tanguy Urvoy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the underexplored challenge of detecting synthetic tabular data in real-world scenarios using an innovative datum-wise transformer architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need for reliable methods to detect synthetic tabular data, a challenging task due to table heterogeneity and unseen formats, which has been overlooked compared to detection for images and text.

Method: A novel datum-wise transformer model coupled with a table-adaptation component is introduced to enhance robustness and accuracy in detecting synthetic tabular data.

Result: The proposed method outperformed the existing baseline by improving AUC and accuracy by 7 points, with the table-adaptation component providing an additional 7 accuracy points.

Conclusion: Detecting synthetic tabular data under real-world conditions is feasible and can achieve high reliability using the proposed approach.

Abstract: The rise of powerful generative models has sparked concerns over data
authenticity. While detection methods have been extensively developed for
images and text, the case of tabular data, despite its ubiquity, has been
largely overlooked. Yet, detecting synthetic tabular data is especially
challenging due to its heterogeneous structure and unseen formats at test time.
We address the underexplored task of detecting synthetic tabular data in the
wild, where tables have variable and previously unseen schemas. We introduce a
novel datum-wise transformer architecture that significantly outperforms the
only previously published baseline, improving both AUC and accuracy by 7
points. By incorporating a table-adaptation component, our model gains an
additional 7 accuracy points, demonstrating enhanced robustness. This work
provides the first strong evidence that detecting synthetic tabular data in
real-world conditions is not only feasible, but can be done with high
reliability.

### [500] [Pruning Weights but Not Truth: Safeguarding Truthfulness While Pruning LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00096)
*Yao Fu,Runchao Li,Xianxuan Long,Haotian Yu,Xiaotian Han,Yu Yin,Pan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies the challenge of maintaining LLMs' truthfulness capabilities in detecting lies after neural network pruning and introduces an innovative approach called TPLO to overcome this without compromising performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to balance efficient deployment of LLMs in low-resource settings with preserving their vital capability to detect lies, which gets disrupted by conventional pruning methods.

Method: The authors propose Truthful Pruning aligned by Layer-wise Outliers (TPLO), emphasizing layers with more activation outliers and discriminative features, and introduce a refined prompting rule for the TruthfulQA benchmark.

Result: TPLO facilitates robust lie detection after pruning, achieving 88% accuracy at 50% sparsity, and improves performance on the TruthfulQA benchmark.

Conclusion: The proposed TPLO approach and improved benchmarking ensure effective LLM pruning while maintaining essential lie detection capabilities for low-resource scenarios.

Abstract: Neural network pruning has emerged as a promising approach for deploying LLMs
in low-resource scenarios while preserving downstream task performance.
However, for the first time, we reveal that such pruning disrupts LLMs'
internal activation features crucial for lie detection, where probing
classifiers (typically small logistic regression models) trained on these
features assess the truthfulness of LLM-generated statements. This discovery
raises a crucial open question: how can we prune LLMs without sacrificing these
critical lie detection capabilities? Our investigation further reveals that
naively adjusting layer-wise pruning sparsity based on importance inadvertently
removes crucial weights, failing to improve lie detection performance despite
its reliance on the most crucial LLM layer. To address this issue, we propose
Truthful Pruning aligned by Layer-wise Outliers (TPLO), which places greater
emphasis on layers with more activation outliers and stronger discriminative
features simultaneously. This preserves LLMs' original performance while
retaining critical features of inner states needed for robust lie detection.
Moreover, we introduce a prompting rule to enrich the TruthfulQA benchmark for
better calibrating LLM pruning. Empirical results show that our approach
improves the hallucination detection for pruned LLMs (achieving 88% accuracy at
50% sparsity) and enhances their performance on TruthfulQA.

*Kaiqi Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces PEGE, an alternative to the commonly used STE in neural network quantization, aimed at reducing discretization errors for better accuracy at extremely low bit-widths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of Straight-Through Estimator (STE) in dealing with discretization errors during neural network quantization, especially at low bit-widths, which degrade model accuracy.

Method: The proposed method, PEGE, uses a logarithmic curriculum-driven mixed-precision replacement strategy for weights/activations and formulates Quantization-Aware Training as a co-optimization problem, minimizing both task loss and discretization error simultaneously.

Result: PEGE demonstrates improved performance over existing methods in experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, with low-precision models achieving accuracy levels comparable to or exceeding their full-precision versions.

Conclusion: PEGE is a generalizable and effective method for neural network quantization, offering significant accuracy improvements and robustness in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Neural network quantization aims to reduce the bit-widths of weights and
activations, making it a critical technique for deploying deep neural networks
on resource-constrained hardware. Most Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)
methods rely on the Straight-Through Estimator (STE) to address the
non-differentiability of discretization functions by replacing their
derivatives with that of the identity function. While effective, STE overlooks
discretization errors between continuous and quantized values, which can lead
to accuracy degradation -- especially at extremely low bit-widths. In this
paper, we propose Progressive Element-wise Gradient Estimation (PEGE), a simple
yet effective alternative to STE, which can be seamlessly integrated with any
forward propagation methods and improves the quantized model accuracy. PEGE
progressively replaces full-precision weights and activations with their
quantized counterparts via a novel logarithmic curriculum-driven
mixed-precision replacement strategy. Then it formulates QAT as a
co-optimization problem that simultaneously minimizes the task loss for
prediction and the discretization error for quantization, providing a unified
and generalizable framework. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet
across various architectures (e.g., ResNet, VGG) demonstrate that PEGE
consistently outperforms existing backpropagation methods and enables
low-precision models to match or even outperform the accuracy of their
full-precision counterparts.

*Huixiang Zhang,Mahzabeen Emu,Salimur Choudhury*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces LLM-QUBO, an automated framework using a Large Language Model (LLM) and a hybrid quantum-classical approach to simplify the process of solving optimization problems on quantum hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of manually translating optimization problems into QUBO format and the scalability issues of current quantum hardware, making quantum annealing more practical for real-world use.

Method: The proposed framework, LLM-QUBO, uses an LLM for natural language parsing to automatically generate problem representations and applies a hybrid quantum-classical Benders' decomposition method to partition and solve problems.

Result: The system's correctness and scalability were validated using classical solvers, demonstrating its robustness and readiness for future quantum hardware.

Conclusion: LLM-QUBO bridges classical AI with quantum computing, simplifying optimization problem-solving and significantly lowering the barrier to utilizing quantum devices for large-scale challenges.

Abstract: Quantum annealing offers a promising paradigm for solving NP-hard
combinatorial optimization problems, but its practical application is severely
hindered by two challenges: the complex, manual process of translating problem
descriptions into the requisite Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization
(QUBO) format and the scalability limitations of current quantum hardware. To
address these obstacles, we propose a novel end-to-end framework, LLM-QUBO,
that automates this entire formulation-to-solution pipeline. Our system
leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to parse natural language, automatically
generating a structured mathematical representation. To overcome hardware
limitations, we integrate a hybrid quantum-classical Benders' decomposition
method. This approach partitions the problem, compiling the combinatorial
complex master problem into a compact QUBO format, while delegating linearly
structured sub-problems to classical solvers. The correctness of the generated
QUBO and the scalability of the hybrid approach are validated using classical
solvers, establishing a robust performance baseline and demonstrating the
framework's readiness for quantum hardware. Our primary contribution is a
synergistic computing paradigm that bridges classical AI and quantum computing,
addressing key challenges in the practical application of optimization problem.
This automated workflow significantly reduces the barrier to entry, providing a
viable pathway to transform quantum devices into accessible accelerators for
large-scale, real-world optimization challenges.

### [503] [ART: Adaptive Resampling-based Training for Imbalanced Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00955)
*Arjun Basandrai,Shourya Jain,K. Ilanthenral*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ART (Adaptive Resampling-based Training), which adjusts class distribution dynamically based on performance metrics to improve classification in imbalanced datasets, achieving better results than traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing resampling methods for class imbalance rely on fixed data distributions and overlook class-wise learning difficulty, leading to suboptimal model performance.

Method: ART periodically modifies the training data distribution based on class-wise macro F1 scores, computed at fixed intervals, to adaptively resample performance-underperforming classes at the class level.

Result: ART consistently outperforms other methods like SMOTE and NearMiss across diverse datasets, achieving statistically significant improvements in macro F1 scores, especially on tabular datasets.

Conclusion: ART offers a reliable and robust approach for handling imbalanced classification, achieving consistent gains across tasks compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Traditional resampling methods for handling class imbalance typically uses
fixed distributions, undersampling the majority or oversampling the minority.
These static strategies ignore changes in class-wise learning difficulty, which
can limit the overall performance of the model.
  This paper proposes an Adaptive Resampling-based Training (ART) method that
periodically updates the distribution of the training data based on the
class-wise performance of the model. Specifically, ART uses class-wise macro F1
scores, computed at fixed intervals, to determine the degree of resampling to
be performed.
  Unlike instance-level difficulty modeling, which is noisy and
outlier-sensitive, ART adapts at the class level. This allows the model to
incrementally shift its attention towards underperforming classes in a way that
better aligns with the optimization objective.
  Results on diverse benchmarks, including Pima Indians Diabetes and Yeast
dataset demonstrate that ART consistently outperforms both resampling-based and
algorithm-level methods, including Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique
(SMOTE), NearMiss Undersampling, and Cost-sensitive Learning on binary as well
as multi-class classification tasks with varying degrees of imbalance.
  In most settings, these improvements are statistically significant. On
tabular datasets, gains are significant under paired t-tests and Wilcoxon tests
(p < 0.05), while results on text and image tasks remain favorable. Compared to
training on the original imbalanced data, ART improves macro F1 by an average
of 2.64 percentage points across all tested tabular datasets. Unlike existing
methods, whose performance varies by task, ART consistently delivers the
strongest macro F1, making it a reliable choice for imbalanced classification.

### [504] [Exploiting a Mixture-of-Layers in an Electrocardiography Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00102)
*Phu X. Nguyen,Huy Phan,Hieu Pham,Christos Chatzichristos,Bert Vandenberk,Maarten De Vos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper questions whether the final layer of pre-trained Transformer models is optimal for downstream tasks with ECGs and proposes a new architecture (PMA) that aggregates multi-layer representations to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of understanding and optimization regarding the internal representations of Transformer-based models used in ECG signal analysis.

Method: The authors propose a Post-pretraining Mixture-of-layers Aggregation (PMA) architecture that flexibly combines layer-wise representations of a Transformer model. This involves using masked modeling in pretraining and a gating network for selective multi-layer fusion in downstream tasks.

Result: PMA demonstrates enhanced representational diversity and improved performance in downstream ECG tasks by enabling the aggregation and selection of multiple model layer outputs.

Conclusion: The final layer of a Transformer may not always be optimal; instead, aggregating diverse representations from multiple layers proves more effective for various tasks in ECG analysis.

Abstract: Transformer-based foundation models for Electrocardiograms (ECGs) have
recently achieved impressive performance in many downstream applications.
However, the internal representations of such models across layers have not
been fully understood and exploited. An important question arises: Does the
final layer of the pre-trained Transformer model, the \emph{de facto}
representational layer, provide optimal performance for downstream tasks?
Although our answer based on empirical and theoretical analyses for this
question is negative, we propose a novel approach to leverage the
representation diversity of the model's layers effectively. Specifically, we
introduce a novel architecture called Post-pretraining Mixture-of-layers
Aggregation (PMA), which enables a flexible combination of the layer-wise
representations from the layer stack of a Transformer-based foundation model.
We first pre-train the model from ECG signals using the 1-dimensional Vision
Transformer (ViT) via masked modeling. In downstream applications, instead of
relying solely on the last layer of the model, we employ a gating network to
selectively fuse the representations from the pretrained model's layers,
thereby enhancing representation power and improving performance of the
downstream applications. In addition, we extend the proposed method to the
pretraining stage by aggregating all representations through group-wise
averaging before feeding them into the decoder-based Transformer.

*Robert MacKnight,Jose Emilio Regio,Jeffrey G. Ethier,Luke A. Baldwin,Gabe Gomes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study highlights that pre-trained large language models (LLMs) outperform traditional Bayesian optimization (BO) and random sampling in optimizing complex chemical experiments, particularly in rare high-performing conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to enhance optimization in experimental chemistry by leveraging pre-trained knowledge in large language models, which may provide better guidance in complex parameter spaces compared to traditional methods.

Method: Six reaction datasets are used to benchmark LLM-guided optimization against Bayesian optimization and random sampling. An information theory framework is introduced to analyze sampling diversity and optimization performance.

Result: LLMs consistently match or surpass BO in single-objective benchmarks, especially in rare or complex parameter spaces. Higher exploration entropy is noted in LLMs, with BO excelling only in explicit multi-objective cases.

Conclusion: LLM-guided optimization proves more effective in navigating complex chemical parameter spaces, demonstrating the value of domain knowledge over pure mathematical strategies. A no-code platform, Iron Mind, is released for broader community evaluation.

Abstract: Modern optimization in experimental chemistry employs algorithmic search
through black-box parameter spaces. Here we demonstrate that pre-trained
knowledge in large language models (LLMs) fundamentally changes this paradigm.
Using six fully enumerated categorical reaction datasets (768 - 5,684
experiments), we benchmark LLM-guided optimization (LLM-GO) against Bayesian
optimization (BO) and random sampling. Frontier LLMs consistently match or
exceed BO performance across five single-objective datasets, with advantages
growing as parameter complexity increases and high-performing conditions become
scarce (<5% of space). BO retains superiority only for explicit multi-objective
trade-offs. To understand these contrasting behaviors, we introduce a
topology-agnostic information theory framework quantifying sampling diversity
throughout optimization campaigns. This analysis reveals that LLMs maintain
systematically higher exploration entropy than BO across all datasets while
achieving superior performance, with advantages most pronounced in
solution-scarce parameter spaces where high-entropy exploration typically fails
- suggesting that pre-trained domain knowledge enables more effective
navigation of chemical parameter space rather than replacing structured
exploration strategies. To enable transparent benchmarking and community
validation, we release Iron Mind (https://gomes.andrew.cmu.edu/iron-mind), a
no-code platform for side-by-side evaluation of human, algorithmic, and LLM
optimization campaigns with public leaderboards and complete trajectories. Our
findings establish that LLM-GO excels precisely where traditional methods
struggle: complex categorical spaces requiring domain understanding rather than
mathematical optimization.

### [506] [Online Identification of IT Systems through Active Causal Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02130)
*Kim Hammar,Rolf Stadler*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an online, data-driven method for identifying causal models in IT systems using active causal learning, which employs Gaussian process regression and rollout-based interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges posed by the increasing complexity and dynamism of modern IT systems, particularly in identifying causal models for automated network and system management.

Method: Active causal learning iteratively estimates causal dependencies among system variables using Gaussian process regression, supported by system measurements and rollout-based intervention policies.

Result: Experiments validate that the proposed method accurately identifies causal models for IT systems while minimizing operational interference.

Conclusion: Active causal learning represents a principled and optimal approach for online causal model identification, enabling improved IT system management tasks.

Abstract: Identifying a causal model of an IT system is fundamental to many branches of
systems engineering and operation. Such a model can be used to predict the
effects of control actions, optimize operations, diagnose failures, detect
intrusions, etc., which is central to achieving the longstanding goal of
automating network and system management tasks. Traditionally, causal models
have been designed and maintained by domain experts. This, however, proves
increasingly challenging with the growing complexity and dynamism of modern IT
systems. In this paper, we present the first principled method for online,
data-driven identification of an IT system in the form of a causal model. The
method, which we call active causal learning, estimates causal functions that
capture the dependencies among system variables in an iterative fashion using
Gaussian process regression based on system measurements, which are collected
through a rollout-based intervention policy. We prove that this method is
optimal in the Bayesian sense and that it produces effective interventions.
Experimental validation on a testbed shows that our method enables accurate
identification of a causal system model while inducing low interference with
system operations.

*Zhijie Zhong,Zhiwen Yu,Yiu-ming Cheung,Kaixiang Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Confidence-Consistency Evaluation (CCE), a new metric for time series anomaly detection evaluation, addressing issues like discriminative power, hyperparameter dependency, and computational overhead. CCE is robust, efficient, and theoretically supported. They also propose RankEval for standardized metric comparison.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics for time series anomaly detection have multiple shortcomings such as being overly dependent on hyperparameters, being sensitive to perturbations, lacking discriminative power, and being computationally expensive.

Method: The paper employs Bayesian estimation to measure anomaly score uncertainties and develops global and event-level confidence and consistency scores. These components form the basis for the simplified CCE metric. They also propose RankEval, a standardized benchmark for comparative analysis of metrics.

Result: CCE is shown to satisfy strict boundedness, Lipschitz robustness, and linear time complexity. RankEval provides a reproducible platform for comparing the ranking efficacy of metrics. Implementations of both CCE and RankEval are made open-source.

Conclusion: The proposed CCE metric effectively addresses the limitations of existing evaluation metrics while being computationally efficient and theoretically robust. RankEval serves as a reproducible benchmark, advancing objective comparisons in this field.

Abstract: Time Series Anomaly Detection metrics serve as crucial tools for model
evaluation. However, existing metrics suffer from several limitations:
insufficient discriminative power, strong hyperparameter dependency,
sensitivity to perturbations, and high computational overhead. This paper
introduces Confidence-Consistency Evaluation (CCE), a novel evaluation metric
that simultaneously measures prediction confidence and uncertainty consistency.
By employing Bayesian estimation to quantify the uncertainty of anomaly scores,
we construct both global and event-level confidence and consistency scores for
model predictions, resulting in a concise CCE metric. Theoretically and
experimentally, we demonstrate that CCE possesses strict boundedness, Lipschitz
robustness against score perturbations, and linear time complexity
$\mathcal{O}(n)$. Furthermore, we establish RankEval, a benchmark for comparing
the ranking capabilities of various metrics. RankEval represents the first
standardized and reproducible evaluation pipeline that enables objective
comparison of evaluation metrics. Both CCE and RankEval implementations are
fully open-source.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The thesis focuses on improving the efficiency of deep learning systems through principled approximation methods. It addresses discrete constraints and non-differentiability challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the increasing computational and energy demands of large deep learning models that hinder deployment and broader adoption.

Method: The paper explores architectural design, model compression (pruning and quantization), and optimization methods. It introduces continuous approximations for discrete problems, enabling gradient-based training alongside model parameters, parameter sharing in architecture design, and a novel adaptive optimizer for quicker hyperparameter tuning.

Result: The proposed methods achieve significant efficiency improvements in training and inference across image classification, language modeling, and generative modeling tasks while maintaining or enhancing model performance.

Conclusion: Scalable and principled approximations can address computationally hard problems in deep learning, facilitating efficient systems without compromising performance.

Abstract: Recent progress in deep learning has been driven by increasingly larger
models. However, their computational and energy demands have grown
proportionally, creating significant barriers to their deployment and to a
wider adoption of deep learning technologies. This thesis investigates
principled approximation methods for improving the efficiency of deep learning
systems, with a particular focus on settings that involve discrete constraints
and non-differentiability.
  We study three main approaches toward improved efficiency: architecture
design, model compression, and optimization. For model compression, we propose
novel approximations for pruning and quantization that frame the underlying
discrete problem as continuous and differentiable, enabling gradient-based
training of compression schemes alongside the model's parameters. These
approximations allow for fine-grained sparsity and precision configurations,
leading to highly compact models without significant fine-tuning. In the
context of architecture design, we design an algorithm for neural architecture
search that leverages parameter sharing across layers to efficiently explore
implicitly recurrent architectures. Finally, we study adaptive optimization,
revisiting theoretical properties of widely used methods and proposing an
adaptive optimizer that allows for quick hyperparameter tuning.
  Our contributions center on tackling computationally hard problems via
scalable and principled approximations. Experimental results on image
classification, language modeling, and generative modeling tasks show that the
proposed methods provide significant improvements in terms of training and
inference efficiency while maintaining, or even improving, the model's
performance.

*Aishwarya Sarkar,Autrin Hakimi,Xiaoqiong Chen,Hai Huang,Chaoqun Lu,Ibrahim Demir,Ali Jannesari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces HydroGAT, a spatiotemporal network designed for accurate flood prediction by leveraging a fine-grained graph representation of river networks and basin nodes, achieving high prediction performance and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate flood prediction remains a challenge due to the need for modeling complex spatiotemporal interactions and hydrological routing within river networks. Existing methods often fail to simultaneously address spatial and temporal dependencies or suffer from scalability issues.

Method: The study proposes HydroGAT, a spatiotemporal Graph Attention Network, built on a heterogeneous basin graph with nodes connected by hydrological flow and inter-catchment relationships. A distributed data-parallel training pipeline enables scalable implementation on high-performance computing infrastructure.

Result: HydroGAT achieves superior performance with NSE up to 0.97, KGE up to 0.96, and low biases within ±5% on two Midwestern US basins. It also provides interpretable attention maps for better insights into inter-catchment influences.

Conclusion: HydroGAT establishes itself as a state-of-the-art model for flood prediction by effectively capturing spatiotemporal dependencies, offering high accuracy, interpretability, and scalability for fine-grained hydrological forecasting.

Abstract: Accurate flood forecasting remains a challenge for water-resource management,
as it demands modeling of local, time-varying runoff drivers (e.g.,
rainfall-induced peaks, baseflow trends) and complex spatial interactions
across a river network. Traditional data-driven approaches, such as
convolutional networks and sequence-based models, ignore topological
information about the region. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) propagate
information exactly along the river network, which is ideal for learning
hydrological routing. However, state-of-the-art GNN-based flood prediction
models collapse pixels to coarse catchment polygons as the cost of training
explodes with graph size and higher resolution. Furthermore, most existing
methods treat spatial and temporal dependencies separately, either applying
GNNs solely on spatial graphs or transformers purely on temporal sequences,
thus failing to simultaneously capture spatiotemporal interactions critical for
accurate flood prediction. We introduce a heterogenous basin graph where every
land and river pixel is a node connected by physical hydrological flow
directions and inter-catchment relationships. We propose HydroGAT, a
spatiotemporal network that adaptively learns local temporal importance and the
most influential upstream locations. Evaluated in two Midwestern US basins and
across five baseline architectures, our model achieves higher NSE (up to 0.97),
improved KGE (up to 0.96), and low bias (PBIAS within $\pm$5%) in hourly
discharge prediction, while offering interpretable attention maps that reveal
sparse, structured intercatchment influences. To support high-resolution
basin-scale training, we develop a distributed data-parallel pipeline that
scales efficiently up to 64 NVIDIA A100 GPUs on NERSC Perlmutter supercomputer,
demonstrating up to 15x speedup across machines. Our code is available at
https://github.com/swapp-lab/HydroGAT.

*Guangzheng Zhong,Yang Liu,Jiming Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper generalizes performative prediction to nonlinear contexts using kernel methods and proposes an algorithm for stability that outperforms existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Performative prediction needs expansion to real-world, nonlinear scenarios, as current approaches largely focus on linear cases under strong assumptions.

Method: The authors use a maximum margin loss approach and kernel methods, with a discrepancy metric for quantifying distribution shifts, enabling stability conditions in both linear and nonlinear scenarios.

Result: Their algorithm achieves performative stability with experimental validation on synthetic and real-world datasets, surpassing baseline models.

Conclusion: The paper improves and generalizes performative prediction in nonlinear settings while demonstrating theoretical and empirical superiority.

Abstract: Performative prediction is an emerging paradigm in machine learning that
addresses scenarios where the model's prediction may induce a shift in the
distribution of the data it aims to predict. Current works in this field often
rely on uncontrollable assumptions, such as bounded gradients of performative
loss, and primarily focus on linear cases in their examples and evaluations to
maintain consistency between theoretical guarantees and empirical validations.
However, such linearity rarely holds in real-world applications, where the data
usually exhibit complex nonlinear characteristics. In this paper, we relax
these out-of-control assumptions and present a novel design that generalizes
performative prediction to nonlinear cases while preserving essential
theoretical properties. Specifically, we formulate the loss function of
performative prediction using a maximum margin approach and extend it to
nonlinear spaces through kernel methods. To quantify the data distribution
shift, we employ the discrepancy between prediction errors on these two
distributions as an indicator, which characterizes the impact of the
performative effect on specific learning tasks. By doing so, we can derive, for
both linear and nonlinear cases, the conditions for performative stability, a
critical and desirable property in performative contexts. Building on these
theoretical insights, we develop an algorithm that guarantees the performative
stability of the predictive model. We validate the effectiveness of our method
through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets with both linear and
nonlinear data distributions, demonstrating superior performance compared to
state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: The paper introduces FNODE, a data-driven approach for constrained multibody systems, aiming to improve computational efficiency and prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods face challenges with computational inefficiency and poor long-term prediction accuracy for multibody systems.

Method: FNODE trains on acceleration vector fields rather than integrated states, avoiding the need for ODE solver backpropagation and utilizing a hybrid FFT and FD numerical differentiation approach.

Result: FNODE consistently outperformed existing models across diverse systems like mass-spring-damper and double pendulum setups, proving superior in accuracy, generalization, and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: FNODE effectively addresses persistent challenges in multibody system modeling, presenting a computationally efficient and accurate approach.

Abstract: Data-driven modeling of constrained multibody systems faces two persistent
challenges: high computational cost and limited long-term prediction accuracy.
To address these issues, we introduce the Flow-Matching Neural Ordinary
Differential Equation (FNODE), a framework that learns acceleration vector
fields directly from trajectory data. By reformulating the training objective
to supervise accelerations rather than integrated states, FNODE eliminates the
need for backpropagation through an ODE solver, which represents a bottleneck
in traditional Neural ODEs. Acceleration targets are computed efficiently using
numerical differentiation techniques, including a hybrid Fast Fourier Transform
(FFT) and Finite Difference (FD) scheme. We evaluate FNODE on a diverse set of
benchmarks, including the single and triple mass-spring-damper systems, double
pendulum, slider-crank, and cart-pole. Across all cases, FNODE consistently
outperforms existing approaches such as Multi-Body Dynamic Neural ODE
(MBD-NODE), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Fully Connected Neural
Networks (FCNN), demonstrating good accuracy, generalization, and computational
efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Adaptive Depth Message Passing GNN (ADMP-GNN), which dynamically adjusts the message-passing layers per node to enhance performance compared to traditional GNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional GNNs use a fixed number of message-passing steps for all nodes, which may not suit nodes with diverse computational needs and characteristics.

Method: The authors propose ADMP-GNN, a framework that tailors the number of message-passing layers to each node dynamically, based on their specific needs.

Result: ADMP-GNN demonstrates improved performance in node classification tasks, validated through experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: Adaptive depth in message passing enhances GNN effectiveness, offering results better than those of baseline models.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven to be highly effective in various
graph learning tasks. A key characteristic of GNNs is their use of a fixed
number of message-passing steps for all nodes in the graph, regardless of each
node's diverse computational needs and characteristics. Through empirical
real-world data analysis, we demonstrate that the optimal number of
message-passing layers varies for nodes with different characteristics. This
finding is further supported by experiments conducted on synthetic datasets. To
address this, we propose Adaptive Depth Message Passing GNN (ADMP-GNN), a novel
framework that dynamically adjusts the number of message passing layers for
each node, resulting in improved performance. This approach applies to any
model that follows the message passing scheme. We evaluate ADMP-GNN on the node
classification task and observe performance improvements over baseline GNN
models.

*Hao Mark Chen,Zhiwen Mo,Guanxi Lu,Shuang Liang,Lingxiao Ma,Wayne Luk,Hongxiang Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlashTTS is a serving system designed for memory-constrained edge devices using LLMs to efficiently improve reasoning capabilities while minimizing latency and maximizing goodput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable high-performance reasoning by memory-constrained LLMs on edge devices, where existing methods struggle with prohibitive computational overhead.

Method: FlashTTS introduces three optimizations: Speculative Beam Extension, Asymmetric Multi-Model Memory Allocation, and Dynamic Prefix-Aware Scheduling, integrated into the vLLM platform.

Result: FlashTTS achieves 2.2x higher goodput and reduces latency by 38%-68% on edge devices compared to the vLLM baseline.

Conclusion: FlashTTS makes test-time scaling feasible on edge devices, providing cloud-level model accuracy and latency, thereby facilitating democratization of high-performance AI.

Abstract: Deploying agentic AI on edge devices is crucial for privacy and
responsiveness, but memory constraints typically relegate these systems to
smaller Large Language Models (LLMs) with inferior reasoning capabilities.
Test-Time Scaling (TTS) can bridge this reasoning gap by dedicating more
compute during inference, but existing methods incur prohibitive overhead on
edge hardware. To overcome this, we introduce FlashTTS, a serving system that
makes TTS practical for memory-constrained LLM reasoning. FlashTTS introduces
three synergistic optimizations: (i) Speculative Beam Extension to mitigate
system stragglers from irregular reasoning paths; (ii) Asymmetric Multi-Model
Memory Allocation to dynamically balance memory between generation and
verification; and (iii) Dynamic Prefix-Aware Scheduling to maximize KV-cache
reuse. Built as a plug-and-play library for vLLM, FlashTTS enables edge LLMs on
a single consumer GPU (24 GB) to match the accuracy and latency of large cloud
models. Our evaluation demonstrates that FlashTTS achieves an average 2.2x
higher goodput and reduces latency by 38%-68% compared to a vLLM baseline,
paving the way for democratized, high-performance agentic AI on edge devices.

### [514] [From TLinFormer to TConstFormer: The Leap to Constant-Time Transformer Attention: Achieving O(1) Computation and O(1) KV Cache during Autoregressive Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00202)
*Zhongpan Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces TConstFormer to address inefficiencies in Transformer processing for ultra-long sequences by achieving a constant-size KV Cache and reducing computational complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limitations in Transformer models, such as growing KV Cache and high computational costs, prevent efficient processing of ultra-long sequences.

Method: The paper proposes the TConstFormer architecture with a periodic state update mechanism, combining constant-time computations with rare linear-time synchronizations.

Result: TConstFormer shows significant improvements in speed, memory efficiency, and overall performance compared to baseline models, particularly for long-text inference tasks.

Conclusion: TConstFormer enables efficient, streaming language model applications, proving its effectiveness in handling ultra-long sequence data.

Abstract: Although the Transformer has become the cornerstone of modern AI, its
autoregressive inference suffers from a linearly growing KV Cache and a
computational complexity of O(N^2 d), severely hindering its ability to process
ultra-long sequences. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces the
TConstFormer architecture, building upon our previous work, TLinFormer.
TConstFormer employs an innovative periodic state update mechanism to achieve a
truly constant-size O(1) KV Cache. The computational complexity of this
mechanism is also O(1) in an amortized sense: it performs purely constant-time
computations for $k-1$ consecutive steps (e.g., $k=256$) and executes a single
linear-time global information synchronization only on the $k$-th step.
Theoretical calculations and experimental results demonstrate that TConstFormer
exhibits an overwhelming advantage over baseline models in terms of speed,
memory efficiency, and overall performance on long-text inference tasks. This
breakthrough paves the way for efficient and robust streaming language model
applications.

*Xuyang Li,Mahdi Masmoudi,Rami Gharbi,Nizar Lajnef,Vishnu Naresh Boddeti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Neptune is a new method for inferring non-linear, spatiotemporal parameter fields in PDEs, offering significant improvements over existing methods like PINNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately estimating parameters in PDEs with non-linear, spatiotemporal variations is challenging, especially in the presence of limited observational data.

Method: Neptune uses independent coordinate neural networks to represent parameter fields continuously in physical space or state variables.

Result: Neptune reduces parameter estimation errors by two orders of magnitude and prediction errors by a factor of 10 compared to PINNs, performing well even with sparse data (e.g., 50 observations).

Conclusion: Neptune enables reliable, data-efficient parameter estimation, extending its applicability to challenging real-world problems in engineering, healthcare, and physics.

Abstract: Parameterized partial differential equations (PDEs) underpin the mathematical
modeling of complex systems in diverse domains, including engineering,
healthcare, and physics. A central challenge in using PDEs for real-world
applications is to accurately infer the parameters, particularly when the
parameters exhibit non-linear and spatiotemporal variations. Existing parameter
estimation methods, such as sparse identification and physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs), struggle in such cases, especially with nonlinear dynamics,
multiphysics interactions, or limited observations of the system response. To
address these challenges, we introduce Neptune, a general-purpose method
capable of inferring parameter fields from sparse measurements of system
responses. Neptune employs independent coordinate neural networks to
continuously represent each parameter field in physical space or in state
variables. Across various physical and biomedical problems, where direct
parameter measurements are prohibitively expensive or unattainable, Neptune
significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving robust parameter
estimation from as few as 50 observations, reducing parameter estimation errors
by two orders of magnitude and dynamic response prediction errors by a factor
of ten compared to PINNs. Furthermore, Neptune exhibits superior extrapolation
capabilities, enabling accurate predictions in regimes beyond training data
where PINN fail. By facilitating reliable and data-efficient parameter
inference, Neptune promises broad transformative impacts in engineering,
healthcare, and beyond.

*Tim Schwabe,Moritz Lange,Laurenz Wiskott,Maribel Acosta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study examines biases (Marginal Distribution Asymmetry and Marginal Distribution Shift Asymmetry) in gradient-based causal discovery methods, how they impact outcomes, and mitigation strategies to enhance robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address susceptibility of gradient-based causal discovery methods to distributional biases in data, leading to skewed causal factorizations.

Method: Through bivariate categorical setup and simple models, the study identifies biases in synthetic data and evaluates their effects on causal learning strategies by studying marginal or conditional data distributions.

Result: The biases significantly affect causal discovery outcomes, though removing competition between causal factorizations can improve robustness.

Conclusion: Effective mitigation of biases in gradient-based causal discovery methods enhances their validity and reliability in determining causal structures.

Abstract: Gradient-based causal discovery shows great potential for deducing causal
structure from data in an efficient and scalable way. Those approaches however
can be susceptible to distributional biases in the data they are trained on. We
identify two such biases: Marginal Distribution Asymmetry, where differences in
entropy skew causal learning toward certain factorizations, and Marginal
Distribution Shift Asymmetry, where repeated interventions cause faster shifts
in some variables than in others. For the bivariate categorical setup with
Dirichlet priors, we illustrate how these biases can occur even in controlled
synthetic data. To examine their impact on gradient-based methods, we employ
two simple models that derive causal factorizations by learning marginal or
conditional data distributions - a common strategy in gradient-based causal
discovery. We demonstrate how these models can be susceptible to both biases.
We additionally show how the biases can be controlled. An empirical evaluation
of two related, existing approaches indicates that eliminating competition
between possible causal factorizations can make models robust to the presented
biases.

*Zhi-Feng Wei,Wenqian Chen,Panos Stinis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Transformer-inspired variations of DeepONet, improving accuracy and training efficiency for solving PDEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the trade-off between simplicity/efficiency and accuracy in existing DeepONet frameworks for solving PDEs.

Method: They propose bidirectional cross-conditioning between branch and trunk networks in DeepONet, adapting dynamically based on query-point and input-function information.

Result: The proposed variants surpass or match the accuracy of modified DeepONet while improving training efficiency, demonstrated across four PDE benchmarks.

Conclusion: The variants are effective, with their success linked to the physics of the PDEs studied, and the findings are validated through rigorous statistical analyses.

Abstract: Operator learning has emerged as a promising tool for accelerating the
solution of partial differential equations (PDEs). The Deep Operator Networks
(DeepONets) represent a pioneering framework in this area: the "vanilla"
DeepONet is valued for its simplicity and efficiency, while the modified
DeepONet achieves higher accuracy at the cost of increased training time. In
this work, we propose a series of Transformer-inspired DeepONet variants that
introduce bidirectional cross-conditioning between the branch and trunk
networks in DeepONet. Query-point information is injected into the branch
network and input-function information into the trunk network, enabling dynamic
dependencies while preserving the simplicity and efficiency of the "vanilla"
DeepONet in a non-intrusive manner. Experiments on four PDE benchmarks --
advection, diffusion-reaction, Burgers', and Korteweg-de Vries equations --
show that for each case, there exists a variant that matches or surpasses the
accuracy of the modified DeepONet while offering improved training efficiency.
Moreover, the best-performing variant for each equation aligns naturally with
the equation's underlying characteristics, suggesting that the effectiveness of
cross-conditioning depends on the characteristics of the equation and its
underlying physics. To ensure robustness, we validate the effectiveness of our
variants through a range of rigorous statistical analyses, among them the
Wilcoxon Two One-Sided Test, Glass's Delta, and Spearman's rank correlation.

*Jaya Narain,Zakaria Aldeneh,Shirley Ren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how speech foundation models effectively extract features for diverse time series tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speech and sensor time series data share commonalities in encoding temporal and frequency domain information, yet it's unclear whether speech models can generalize to tasks involving wearable sensor data.

Method: The authors examined features extracted from HuBERT and wav2vec 2.0, comparing their performance with features from self-supervised models trained on specific modality datasets across tasks such as mood classification, arrhythmia detection, and activity classification.

Result: Speech foundation models outperformed modality-specific models, particularly leveraging convolutional feature encoders, especially in data-scarce scenarios.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of speech models to generalize across time series tasks and encourages further exploration towards unified models for speech and sensor data.

Abstract: Both speech and sensor time series data encode information in both the time-
and frequency- domains, like spectral powers and waveform shapelets. We show
that speech foundation models learn representations that are domain-independent
and achieve state-of-the-art performance on time series tasks from wearable
sensors. Probes trained on features extracted from HuBERT and wav2vec 2.0
outperform those extracted from self-supervised models trained directly on
modality specific datasets for mood classification, arrhythmia detection, and
activity classification tasks. We find a particularly strong relevance of the
convolutional feature encoders from speech models for wearable sensor tasks.
The methods proposed here improve performance and robustness for data-scarce
time series tasks, using simple probing methods. This work is a step towards
generalized time series models for speech and sensor data, a topic for further
exploration.

*Stefan-Alexandru Jura,Mihai Udrescu,Alexandru Topirceanu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Q-SSM, a hybrid quantum-optimized model, addresses challenges in long-range time series forecasting by leveraging variational quantum gating to improve stability and multi-scale dependencies, offering enhanced results over existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for long-range time series forecasting face issues like quadratic complexity, unstable training dynamics, sensitivity to initialization, and inefficiency in handling very long horizons.

Method: The paper introduces Q-SSM, which combines state space dynamics with a variational quantum gate via a simple parametrized quantum circuit (RY-RX ansatz). This quantum gating regulates memory updates adaptively and removes reliance on attention mechanisms.

Result: Empirical testing on benchmarks like ETT, Traffic, and Exchange Rate shows Q-SSM outperforms robust models (LSTM, TCN, Reformer), Transformer-based architectures, and state space models like S-Mamba.

Conclusion: Variational quantum gating offers a promising path for addressing limitations in long-range forecasting, enabling precise and robust multivariate predictions while alleviating computational bottlenecks.

Abstract: Long-range time series forecasting remains challenging, as it requires
capturing non-stationary and multi-scale temporal dependencies while
maintaining noise robustness, efficiency, and stability. Transformer-based
architectures such as Autoformer and Informer improve generalization but suffer
from quadratic complexity and degraded performance on very long time horizons.
State space models, notably S-Mamba, provide linear-time updates but often face
unstable training dynamics, sensitivity to initialization, and limited
robustness for multivariate forecasting. To address such challenges, we propose
the Quantum-Optimized Selective State Space Model (Q-SSM), a hybrid
quantum-optimized approach that integrates state space dynamics with a
variational quantum gate. Instead of relying on expensive attention mechanisms,
Q-SSM employs a simple parametrized quantum circuit (RY-RX ansatz) whose
expectation values regulate memory updates adaptively. This quantum gating
mechanism improves convergence stability, enhances the modeling of long-term
dependencies, and provides a lightweight alternative to attention. We
empirically validate Q-SSM on three widely used benchmarks, i.e., ETT, Traffic,
and Exchange Rate. Results show that Q-SSM consistently improves over strong
baselines (LSTM, TCN, Reformer), Transformer-based models, and S-Mamba. These
findings demonstrate that variational quantum gating can address current
limitations in long-range forecasting, leading to accurate and robust
multivariate predictions.

*Yohei Saito,Shun Kimura,Koujin Takeda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new algorithm combining the bouncy particle sampler (BPS) with parallel tempering (PT) to improve convergence to posterior distributions and demonstrates its effectiveness on multimodal distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in evaluating posterior distributions analytically and improve sampling efficiency by using advanced methods.

Method: The authors combine the bouncy particle sampler (BPS) with parallel tempering (PT) and propose a variation with an infinite inverse temperature exchange rate.

Result: Numerical simulations were conducted, showing that the proposed algorithm is effective for sampling from multimodal distributions.

Conclusion: The integration of PT with BPS enhances convergence and is advantageous for complex posterior distributions, demonstrating potential over existing methods like Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC).

Abstract: Bayesian inference is useful to obtain a predictive distribution with a small
generalization error. However, since posterior distributions are rarely
evaluated analytically, we employ the variational Bayesian inference or
sampling method to approximate posterior distributions. When we obtain samples
from a posterior distribution, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) has been widely
used for the continuous variable part and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for
the discrete variable part. Another sampling method, the bouncy particle
sampler (BPS), has been proposed, which combines uniform linear motion and
stochastic reflection to perform sampling. BPS was reported to have the
advantage of being easier to set simulation parameters than HMC. To accelerate
the convergence to a posterior distribution, we introduced parallel tempering
(PT) to BPS, and then proposed an algorithm when the inverse temperature
exchange rate is set to infinity. We performed numerical simulations and
demonstrated its effectiveness for multimodal distribution.

### [521] [Fantastic Pretraining Optimizers and Where to Find Them](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02046)
*Kaiyue Wen,David Hall,Tengyu Ma,Percy Liang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates deep learning optimizers systematically, finding matrix-based optimizers like Muon and Soap offer speedups over AdamW but diminishing performance benefits with increasing model scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AdamW has been the standard optimizer for language model pretraining despite claims of faster alternatives. The paper aims to clarify these claims by addressing biases in hyperparameter tuning and evaluation setups.

Method: Researchers systematically study ten optimizers, testing their performance across four model scales (0.1B-1.2B parameters) and multiple data-to-model ratios. Comparisons were conducted after rigorous hyperparameter tuning and evaluation conditions to ensure fairness.

Result: Matrix-based optimizers deliver faster performance (up to 1.4x speedup for small models), but their benefits diminish for larger models (down to 1.1x for models with 1.2B parameters). Blind hyperparameter transfers and intermediate checkpoint evaluations risk misleading conclusions.

Conclusion: Optimal optimizer choice depends on model scale and training conditions. The study provides actionable insights into rigorous evaluations that are necessary for practical adoption of alternative optimizers in deep learning.

Abstract: AdamW has long been the dominant optimizer in language model pretraining,
despite numerous claims that alternative optimizers offer 1.4 to 2x speedup. We
posit that two methodological shortcomings have obscured fair comparisons and
hindered practical adoption: (i) unequal hyperparameter tuning and (ii) limited
or misleading evaluation setups. To address these two issues, we conduct a
systematic study of ten deep learning optimizers across four model scales
(0.1B-1.2B parameters) and data-to-model ratios (1-8x the Chinchilla optimum).
We find that fair and informative comparisons require rigorous hyperparameter
tuning and evaluations across a range of model scales and data-to-model ratios,
performed at the end of training. First, optimal hyperparameters for one
optimizer may be suboptimal for another, making blind hyperparameter transfer
unfair. Second, the actual speedup of many proposed optimizers over well-tuned
baselines is lower than claimed and decreases with model size to only 1.1x for
1.2B parameter models. Thirdly, comparing intermediate checkpoints before
reaching the target training budgets can be misleading, as rankings between two
optimizers can flip during training due to learning rate decay. Through our
thorough investigation, we find that all the fastest optimizers such as Muon
and Soap, use matrices as preconditioners -- multiplying gradients with
matrices rather than entry-wise scalars. However, the speedup of matrix-based
optimizers is inversely proportional to model scale, decreasing from 1.4x over
AdamW for 0.1B parameter models to merely 1.1x for 1.2B parameter models.

*Ezra Erives,Bowen Jing,Peter Holderrieth,Tommi Jaakkola*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces continuously tempered diffusion samplers to improve neural network-based sampling for unnormalized distributions, addressing exploration limitations with better proposal distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural samplers trained with existing proposal distributions suffer from poor exploration due to isolated modes and annealing path limitations, leading to suboptimal performance in sampling unnormalized distributions.

Method: The proposed approach uses tempered diffusion sampling, introducing a family of distributions across varying temperatures. This mitigates energy barriers at higher temperatures and enhances exploration at desired lower temperatures.

Result: Empirical results validate enhanced sampler performance, which benefits from extended exploration enabled by tempered diffusion techniques.

Conclusion: Continuously tempered diffusion samplers offer improved sampling efficiency over previous methods, providing better exploration mechanisms in the training phase.

Abstract: Annealing-based neural samplers seek to amortize sampling from unnormalized
distributions by training neural networks to transport a family of densities
interpolating from source to target. A crucial design choice in the training
phase of such samplers is the proposal distribution by which locations are
generated at which to evaluate the loss. Previous work has obtained such a
proposal distribution by combining a partially learned transport with annealed
Langevin dynamics. However, isolated modes and other pathological properties of
the annealing path imply that such proposals achieve insufficient exploration
and thereby lower performance post training. To remedy this, we propose
continuously tempered diffusion samplers, which leverage exploration techniques
developed in the context of molecular dynamics to improve proposal
distributions. Specifically, a family of distributions across different
temperatures is introduced to lower energy barriers at higher temperatures and
drive exploration at the lower temperature of interest. We empirically validate
improved sampler performance driven by extended exploration. Code is available

*Samuel Boïté,Eloi Tanguy,Julie Delon,Agnès Desolneux,Rémi Flamary*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces differentiable strategies for the Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm, enabling its integration in modern gradient-based learning. A new application, Mixture Wasserstein distance ($\mathrm{MW}_2$), is explored alongside numerical experiments in machine learning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current use of the EM algorithm limits its role in end-to-end learning pipelines due to its non-differentiable nature. A differentiable EM is needed to expand its usability in modern computational tasks.

Method: The authors explore multiple differentiation strategies for EM, including full automatic differentiation and approximate methods. Additionally, they use differentiable EM for calculating $\mathrm{MW}_2$ and contribute a stability result and an unbalanced variant of $\mathrm{MW}_2$.

Result: Numerical experiments demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach to tasks such as barycentre computation, colour/style transfer, image generation, and texture synthesis.

Conclusion: Differentiable EM methods enable the computation of $\mathrm{MW}_2$ as a loss function, widening its applicability in machine learning and imaging tasks while providing theoretical stability guarantees.

Abstract: The Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm is a central tool in statistics
and machine learning, widely used for latent-variable models such as Gaussian
Mixture Models (GMMs). Despite its ubiquity, EM is typically treated as a
non-differentiable black box, preventing its integration into modern learning
pipelines where end-to-end gradient propagation is essential. In this work, we
present and compare several differentiation strategies for EM, from full
automatic differentiation to approximate methods, assessing their accuracy and
computational efficiency. As a key application, we leverage this differentiable
EM in the computation of the Mixture Wasserstein distance $\mathrm{MW}_2$
between GMMs, allowing $\mathrm{MW}_2$ to be used as a differentiable loss in
imaging and machine learning tasks. To complement our practical use of
$\mathrm{MW}_2$, we contribute a novel stability result which provides
theoretical justification for the use of $\mathrm{MW}_2$ with EM, and also
introduce a novel unbalanced variant of $\mathrm{MW}_2$. Numerical experiments
on barycentre computation, colour and style transfer, image generation, and
texture synthesis illustrate the versatility and effectiveness of the proposed
approach in different settings.

*Renat Sergazinov,Shao-An Yin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper improves the TabPFN framework to handle long contexts efficiently by introducing a tiled-block attention strategy, achieving notable results on the TabArena benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TabPFN models achieve strong results in tabular data analysis but are limited by scalability due to quadratic computation costs in handling large context sizes.

Method: The study introduces a tiled-block attention mechanism for TabPFN, which processes long contexts without preprocessing while remaining GPU-compatible.

Result: The tiled-block approach improves TabPFN's scalability, enabling it to process long contexts effectively and achieve strong performance on the TabArena benchmark.

Conclusion: The tiled-block strategy provides a scalable and efficient solution for processing long-context tabular data, addressing limitations in existing models and achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: TabPFN v2 achieves better results than tree-based models on several tabular
benchmarks, which is notable since tree-based models are usually the strongest
choice for tabular data. However, it cannot handle more than 10K context tokens
because transformers have quadratic computation and memory costs.
  Unlike existing approaches that rely on context compression, such as
selecting representative samples via K-nearest neighbors (KNN), we introduce a
\textbf{tiled-block} strategy to compute attention within the TabPFN framework.
This design is compatible with standard GPU setups and, to the best of our
knowledge, is the first to enable TabPFN to \textbf{process long contexts
without any pre-processing}. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
on the standard TabArena benchmark.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Conditional-$t^3$VAE, which improves generative fairness in imbalanced datasets using a per-class joint prior based on Student's t-distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of unfair latent space allocation in variational autoencoders for imbalanced datasets, particularly to improve generative fairness.

Method: The authors propose Conditional-$t^3$VAE, which enforces equitable latent space allocation via heavy-tailed joint priors and optimizes using a closed-form $
abla$-power divergence objective.

Result: The proposed model achieves lower FID scores and higher per-class F1 metrics compared to baseline methods, particularly under high class imbalance.

Conclusion: Conditional-$t^3$VAE enhances fairness and diversity in generative models, especially in settings with extreme class imbalance.

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with global priors mirror the training set's
class frequency in latent space, underrepresenting tail classes and reducing
generative fairness on imbalanced datasets. While $t^3$VAE improves robustness
via heavy-tailed Student's t-distribution priors, it still allocates latent
volume proportionally to the class frequency.In this work, we address this
issue by explicitly enforcing equitable latent space allocation across classes.
To this end, we propose Conditional-$t^3$VAE, which defines a per-class
\mbox{Student's t} joint prior over latent and output variables, preventing
dominance by majority classes. Our model is optimized using a closed-form
objective derived from the $\gamma$-power divergence. Moreover, for
class-balanced generation, we derive an equal-weight latent mixture of
Student's t-distributions. On SVHN-LT, CIFAR100-LT, and CelebA,
Conditional-$t^3$VAE consistently achieves lower FID scores than both $t^3$VAE
and Gaussian-based VAE baselines, particularly under severe class imbalance. In
per-class F1 evaluations, Conditional-$t^3$VAE also outperforms the conditional
Gaussian VAE across all highly imbalanced settings. While Gaussian-based models
remain competitive under mild imbalance ratio ($\rho \lesssim 3$), our approach
substantially improves generative fairness and diversity in more extreme
regimes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges of exposure bias and high variance in inverse propensity scoring for logged implicit feedback in recommender systems.

Method: The pipeline includes IPS-weighted training and an IPS-weighted Bayesian Personalized Ranking objective, supplemented with a propensity regularizer to reduce variance from extreme propensity weights.

Result: Demonstrated improved robustness and generalization under unbiased exposure, with reduced evaluation variance, using synthetic and MovieLens 100K data.

Conclusion: The approach enhances counterfactual learning and evaluation, providing practical tools for real-world recommendation systems while mitigating exposure bias and instability.

Abstract: Learning and evaluating recommender systems from logged implicit feedback is
challenging due to exposure bias. While inverse propensity scoring (IPS)
corrects this bias, it often suffers from high variance and instability. In
this paper, we present a simple and effective pipeline that integrates
IPS-weighted training with an IPS-weighted Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR)
objective augmented by a Propensity Regularizer (PR). We compare Direct Method
(DM), IPS, and Self-Normalized IPS (SNIPS) for offline policy evaluation, and
demonstrate how IPS-weighted training improves model robustness under biased
exposure. The proposed PR further mitigates variance amplification from extreme
propensity weights, leading to more stable estimates. Experiments on synthetic
and MovieLens 100K data show that our approach generalizes better under
unbiased exposure while reducing evaluation variance compared to naive and
standard IPS methods, offering practical guidance for counterfactual learning
and evaluation in real-world recommendation settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This survey explores calibration in probabilistic predictions, covering definitions, error measurements, and its implications for decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address how predicted probabilities should be interpreted and evaluated in relation to real-world outcomes.

Method: Analyzes recent foundational work on calibration definitions, error measures, and their use in decision-making.

Result: Presents calibration as indistinguishability between the predictor's hypothesis and the real-world outcomes, with measures to assess this.

Conclusion: Calibration plays a critical role in aligning the predictor's probabilistic model with real-world phenomena, aiding reliable decision-making.

Abstract: Calibration is a classical notion from the forecasting literature which aims
to address the question: how should predicted probabilities be interpreted? In
a world where we only get to observe (discrete) outcomes, how should we
evaluate a predictor that hypothesizes (continuous) probabilities over possible
outcomes? The study of calibration has seen a surge of recent interest, given
the ubiquity of probabilistic predictions in machine learning. This survey
describes recent work on the foundational questions of how to define and
measure calibration error, and what these measures mean for downstream decision
makers who wish to use the predictions to make decisions. A unifying viewpoint
that emerges is that of calibration as a form of indistinguishability, between
the world hypothesized by the predictor and the real world (governed by nature
or the Bayes optimal predictor). In this view, various calibration measures
quantify the extent to which the two worlds can be told apart by certain
classes of distinguishers or statistical measures.

TL;DR: Trained diffusion models commonly violate the constraints of true score functions, but they still perform well in generative tasks, which can be better understood through the lens of Wasserstein Gradient Flow (WGF).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to resolve the paradox of why diffusion models, which do not enforce a conservative vector field required for true score functions, are still effective as generative methods.

Method: The paper proposes to reinterpret diffusion training as flow matching under the Wasserstein Gradient Flow (WGF) perspective instead of as score learning via reverse-time stochastic differential equations.

Result: The study shows that despite non-conservative errors in neural vector fields, density transport remains effective, and the WGF perspective captures this phenomenon more naturally.

Conclusion: The authors suggest adopting the elegant and principled WGF framework for a better theoretical understanding of diffusion generative models, avoiding reliance on reverse-time SDE theory.

Abstract: Diffusion models are commonly interpreted as learning the score function,
i.e., the gradient of the log-density of noisy data. However, this assumption
implies that the target of learning is a conservative vector field, which is
not enforced by the neural network architectures used in practice. We present
numerical evidence that trained diffusion networks violate both integral and
differential constraints required of true score functions, demonstrating that
the learned vector fields are not conservative. Despite this, the models
perform remarkably well as generative mechanisms. To explain this apparent
paradox, we advocate a new theoretical perspective: diffusion training is
better understood as flow matching to the velocity field of a Wasserstein
Gradient Flow (WGF), rather than as score learning for a reverse-time
stochastic differential equation. Under this view, the "probability flow"
arises naturally from the WGF framework, eliminating the need to invoke
reverse-time SDE theory and clarifying why generative sampling remains
successful even when the neural vector field is not a true score. We further
show that non-conservative errors from neural approximation do not necessarily
harm density transport. Our results advocate for adopting the WGF perspective
as a principled, elegant, and theoretically grounded framework for
understanding diffusion generative models.

*Dongseok Kim,Wonjun Jeong,Gisung Oh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper establishes Federated Learning as a strategic system influenced by rules and incentives and introduces a framework for distinguishing genuine improvements from metric gaming.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address Federated Learning's reliance on actions taken by participants that may lead to performance manipulation rather than genuine improvement.

Method: Developing analytical indices to quantify behavioral incentives and performance loss, supported by simulations, algorithms, thresholds, and operational checklists.

Result: Created a framework validating the impact of rules, information disclosure, and evaluation methods on behaviors, backed by simulations showcasing consistent patterns.

Conclusion: Combining periodic recalibration, randomization, and connectivity-based alarms lowers metric gaming incentives while fostering stable cooperation in Federated Learning systems.

Abstract: The success of Federated Learning depends on the actions that participants
take out of sight. We model Federated Learning not as a mere optimization task
but as a strategic system entangled with rules and incentives. From this
perspective, we present an analytical framework that makes it possible to
clearly identify where behaviors that genuinely improve performance diverge
from those that merely target metrics. We introduce two indices that
respectively quantify behavioral incentives and collective performance loss,
and we use them as the basis for consistently interpreting the impact of
operational choices such as rule design, the level of information disclosure,
evaluation methods, and aggregator switching. We further summarize thresholds,
auto-switch rules, and early warning signals into a checklist that can be
applied directly in practice, and we provide both a practical algorithm for
allocating limited audit resources and a performance guarantee. Simulations
conducted across diverse environments consistently validate the patterns
predicted by our framework, and we release all procedures for full
reproducibility. While our approach operates most strongly under several
assumptions, combining periodic recalibration, randomization, and
connectivity-based alarms enables robust application under the variability of
real-world operations. We present both design principles and operational
guidelines that lower the incentives for metric gaming while sustaining and
expanding stable cooperation.

*Hanping Zhang,Yuhong Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces LLMDPD, a novel method combining text and trajectory prompts to improve generalization in offline RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline RL agents struggle to generalize to unseen tasks due to limitations in offline datasets and a lack of well-designed online environments.

Method: Proposed LLMDPD uses task-specific prompts, where text prompts (processed with a language model) provide context, and trajectory prompts (processed using transformers) model structured behavioral patterns for a policy-level diffusion model.

Result: Experiments show LLMDPD outperforms state-of-the-art offline RL methods on tasks it has not seen before.

Conclusion: The approach enhances RL agent generalization and adaptability, especially in diverse and unseen task environments.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is known for its strong decision-making
capabilities and has been widely applied in various real-world scenarios.
However, with the increasing availability of offline datasets and the lack of
well-designed online environments from human experts, the challenge of
generalization in offline RL has become more prominent. Due to the limitations
of offline data, RL agents trained solely on collected experiences often
struggle to generalize to new tasks or environments. To address this challenge,
we propose LLM-Driven Policy Diffusion (LLMDPD), a novel approach that enhances
generalization in offline RL using task-specific prompts. Our method
incorporates both text-based task descriptions and trajectory prompts to guide
policy learning. We leverage a large language model (LLM) to process text-based
prompts, utilizing its natural language understanding and extensive knowledge
base to provide rich task-relevant context. Simultaneously, we encode
trajectory prompts using a transformer model, capturing structured behavioral
patterns within the underlying transition dynamics. These prompts serve as
conditional inputs to a context-aware policy-level diffusion model, enabling
the RL agent to generalize effectively to unseen tasks. Our experimental
results demonstrate that LLMDPD outperforms state-of-the-art offline RL methods
on unseen tasks, highlighting its effectiveness in improving generalization and
adaptability in diverse settings.

Motivation: To address the challenge of learning optimal control policies for diffusion processes efficiently and accurately in contrast to generic reinforcement learning methods.

Method: The study solves a variational inequality problem stemming from Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations to devise novel algorithms.

Result: The algorithms yield sharp statistical rates for the learned value function and control policy, influenced by the function class's complexity and approximation errors.

Conclusion: Supervised regression provides a more efficient method for fine-tuning diffusion processes, offering faster statistical rates and bypassing traditional reinforcement learning approaches.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning the optimal control policy for fine-tuning a
given diffusion process, using general value function approximation. We develop
a new class of algorithms by solving a variational inequality problem based on
the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations. We prove sharp statistical rates
for the learned value function and control policy, depending on the complexity
and approximation errors of the function class. In contrast to generic

### [533] [Theory Foundation of Physics-Enhanced Residual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00348)
*Shixiao Liang,Wang Chen,Keke Long,Peng Zhang,Xiaopeng Li,Jintao Ke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides theoretical justification for the advantages of the Physics-Enhanced Residual Learning (PERL) framework, which combines physics-based models with neural networks to achieve better predictive accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research has shown that the integration of neural networks with physics models, particularly through the recently proposed PERL framework, can improve model accuracy and computational efficiency. However, these results are primarily empirical and lack theoretical justification.

Method: The authors theoretically analyze the PERL framework for problems exhibiting Lipschitz continuity. They rigorously derive theorems to explain PERL's advantages, particularly focusing on reduced parameters, faster convergence, and fewer training samples. Additionally, numerical experiments for vehicle trajectory prediction validate these theoretical findings.

Result: The study confirms that PERL achieves better accuracy with significantly fewer training samples compared to traditional neural networks. This result is supported by both theoretical analysis and numerical experiments in autonomous vehicle trajectory prediction.

Conclusion: PERL offers a promising approach to integrating physics-based models and machine learning, achieving high accuracy and efficiency while minimizing the need for extensive data collection. This makes it particularly valuable for real-world applications like autonomous driving, where obtaining training data can be challenging.

Abstract: Intensive studies have been conducted in recent years to integrate neural
networks with physics models to balance model accuracy and interpretability.
One recently proposed approach, named Physics-Enhanced Residual Learning
(PERL), is to use learning to estimate the residual between the physics model
prediction and the ground truth. Numeral examples suggested that integrating
such residual with physics models in PERL has three advantages: (1) a reduction
in the number of required neural network parameters; (2) faster convergence
rates; and (3) fewer training samples needed for the same computational
precision. However, these numerical results lack theoretical justification and
cannot be adequately explained.
  This paper aims to explain these advantages of PERL from a theoretical
perspective. We investigate a general class of problems with Lipschitz
continuity properties. By examining the relationships between the bounds to the
loss function and residual learning structure, this study rigorously proves a
set of theorems explaining the three advantages of PERL.
  Several numerical examples in the context of automated vehicle trajectory
prediction are conducted to illustrate the proposed theorems. The results
confirm that, even with significantly fewer training samples, PERL consistently
achieves higher accuracy than a pure neural network. These results demonstrate
the practical value of PERL in real world autonomous driving applications where
corner case data are costly or hard to obtain. PERL therefore improves
predictive performance while reducing the amount of data required.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of high communication costs in federated learning by leveraging physical channels while accounting for channel noise and hardware constraints.

Method: The authors propose adaptive federated stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithms tailored for physical channel transmissions. They establish convergence guarantees for these algorithms, considering gradient noise levels.

Result: The proposed algorithms showcase convergence rates that adapt to stochastic gradient noise, supported by simulations using deep learning models.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithms are both theoretically sound and practically effective in reducing communication costs and handling channel constraints in federated learning scenarios.

Abstract: In federated learning, communication cost can be significantly reduced by
transmitting the information over the air through physical channels. In this
paper, we propose a new class of adaptive federated stochastic gradient descent
(SGD) algorithms that can be implemented over physical channels, taking into
account both channel noise and hardware constraints. We establish theoretical
guarantees for the proposed algorithms, demonstrating convergence rates that
are adaptive to the stochastic gradient noise level. We also demonstrate the

### [535] [Optimized Weight Initialization on the Stiefel Manifold for Deep ReLU Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00362)
*Hyungu Lee,Taehyeong Kim,Hayoung Choi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a specialized orthogonal initialization optimized for ReLU networks to enhance training stability by addressing neuron inactivation, gradient issues, and activation statistics control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges like dying ReLU and gradient instability caused by improper weight initialization in deep architectures, which are not effectively solved by existing methods like He or Xavier initialization.

Method: The method involves creating an orthogonal initialization optimized for ReLU by solving an optimization problem on the Stiefel manifold, offering closed-form solutions and efficient sampling schemes.

Result: The new initialization method prevents dying ReLU, reduces gradient vanishing, and improves training stability across diverse datasets and scenarios, outperforming previous approaches.

Conclusion: This orthogonal initialization advances the training of deep ReLU networks, ensuring stability and improved performance compared to conventional methods.

Abstract: Stable and efficient training of ReLU networks with large depth is highly
sensitive to weight initialization. Improper initialization can cause permanent
neuron inactivation dying ReLU and exacerbate gradient instability as network
depth increases. Methods such as He, Xavier, and orthogonal initialization
preserve variance or promote approximate isometry. However, they do not
necessarily regulate the pre-activation mean or control activation sparsity,
and their effectiveness often diminishes in very deep architectures. This work
introduces an orthogonal initialization specifically optimized for ReLU by
solving an optimization problem on the Stiefel manifold, thereby preserving
scale and calibrating the pre-activation statistics from the outset. A family
of closed-form solutions and an efficient sampling scheme are derived.
Theoretical analysis at initialization shows that prevention of the dying ReLU
problem, slower decay of activation variance, and mitigation of gradient
vanishing, which together stabilize signal and gradient flow in deep
architectures. Empirically, across MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, multiple tabular
datasets, few-shot settings, and ReLU-family activations, our method
outperforms previous initializations and enables stable training in deep
networks.

### [536] [Unifying Adversarial Perturbation for Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00387)
*Jinluan Yang,Ruihao Zhang,Zhengyu Chen,Fei Wu,Kun Kuang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PerturbEmbedding, a method for integrating adversarial perturbation and training in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), achieving enhanced robustness and generalization across various datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While adversarial training has proven effective in increasing GNN robustness, it has been limited to specific datasets and types of GNNs. There is a need for a broader, unified approach.

Method: The authors developed PerturbEmbedding, which directly applies perturbations to every hidden embedding in GNNs and unifies various perturbation strategies (random and adversarial).

Result: PerturbEmbedding significantly improved GNNs' robustness and generalization capabilities, as validated through experiments across multiple datasets and models.

Conclusion: PerturbEmbedding enhances the resilience of GNNs to adversarial attacks and improves performance, establishing itself as a comprehensive framework for perturbation-based training methods.

Abstract: This paper studies the vulnerability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to
adversarial attacks on node features and graph structure. Various methods have
implemented adversarial training to augment graph data, aiming to bolster the
robustness and generalization of GNNs. These methods typically involve applying
perturbations to the node feature, weights, or graph structure and subsequently
minimizing the loss by learning more robust graph model parameters under the
adversarial perturbations. Despite the effectiveness of adversarial training in
enhancing GNNs' robustness and generalization abilities, its application has
been largely confined to specific datasets and GNN types. In this paper, we
propose a novel method, PerturbEmbedding, that integrates adversarial
perturbation and training, enhancing GNNs' resilience to such attacks and
improving their generalization ability. PerturbEmbedding performs perturbation
operations directly on every hidden embedding of GNNs and provides a unified
framework for most existing perturbation strategies/methods. We also offer a
unified perspective on the forms of perturbations, namely random and
adversarial perturbations. Through experiments on various datasets using
different backbone models, we demonstrate that PerturbEmbedding significantly
improves both the robustness and generalization abilities of GNNs,
outperforming existing methods. The rejection of both random (non-targeted) and
adversarial (targeted) perturbations further enhances the backbone model's
performance.

### [537] [Curriculum Guided Personalized Subgraph Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00402)
*Minku Kang,Hogun Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CUFL introduces a Curriculum Learning-based federated learning framework to address data heterogeneity in subgraph federated learning, mitigating overfitting and improving aggregation efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address severe data heterogeneity and overfitting in subgraph federated learning, which hampers the effectiveness of aggregating diverse client knowledge.

Method: CUFL employs Curriculum Learning at the client side to train on easier cross-client substructures before moving to harder, client-specific substructures, thereby avoiding early overfitting and facilitating gradual personalization. It also improves weighted aggregation by using fine-grained structural indicators estimated on a random reference graph.

Result: Experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that CUFL outperforms traditional methods, achieving higher performance in subgraph federated learning tasks.

Conclusion: CUFL is a robust solution for handling subgraph FL challenges, as it effectively manages data heterogeneity and enables both personalized and collaborative improvement of Graph Neural Networks.

Abstract: Subgraph Federated Learning (FL) aims to train Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
across distributed private subgraphs, but it suffers from severe data
heterogeneity. To mitigate data heterogeneity, weighted model aggregation
personalizes each local GNN by assigning larger weights to parameters from
clients with similar subgraph characteristics inferred from their current model
states. However, the sparse and biased subgraphs often trigger rapid
overfitting, causing the estimated client similarity matrix to stagnate or even
collapse. As a result, aggregation loses effectiveness as clients reinforce
their own biases instead of exploiting diverse knowledge otherwise available.
To this end, we propose a novel personalized subgraph FL framework called
Curriculum guided personalized sUbgraph Federated Learning (CUFL). On the
client side, CUFL adopts Curriculum Learning (CL) that adaptively selects edges
for training according to their reconstruction scores, exposing each GNN first
to easier, generic cross-client substructures and only later to harder,
client-specific ones. This paced exposure prevents early overfitting to biased
patterns and enables gradual personalization. By regulating personalization,
the curriculum also reshapes server aggregation from exchanging generic
knowledge to propagating client-specific knowledge. Further, CUFL improves
weighted aggregation by estimating client similarity using fine-grained
structural indicators reconstructed on a random reference graph. Extensive
experiments on six benchmark datasets confirm that CUFL achieves superior
performance compared to relevant baselines. Code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies anisotropic parameter distributions as a barrier to low-bit quantization in large language models and introduces Metis, a framework to overcome these challenges through spectral decomposition, adaptive learning rates, and dual-range regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anisotropic parameter distributions lead to instability and reduced performance when training large language models with low-bit quantization. Solving this enables more efficient and scalable LLM training.

Method: The framework, Metis, employs spectral decomposition to compress distributions, adaptive learning rates in the spectral domain, and a dual-range regularizer to ensure numerical precision and stability during low-bit training.

Result: Metis enables FP8 training to outperform FP32 baselines and FP4 training to achieve comparable accuracy to FP32 models.

Conclusion: Metis demonstrates robust and scalable LLM training with advanced low-bit quantization, pushing the boundaries of efficient model training under resource constraints.

Abstract: This work identifies anisotropic parameter distributions as a fundamental
barrier to training large language models (LLMs) with low-bit quantization: a
few dominant singular values create wide numerical ranges that conflict with
the inherent bias of block-wise quantization. This bias disproportionately
preserves high-magnitude values while discarding smaller ones, causing training
instability and low model performance. This work introduces Metis, a training
framework that combines (i) spectral decomposition with random embedding to
efficiently disentangle dominant from long-tail components, compressing broad
distributions into quantization-friendly narrow ranges; (ii) adaptive learning
rates in the spectral domain to amplify underrepresented directions and better
capture diverse features critical for performance; and (iii) a dual-range
regularizer that jointly constrains numerical precision and parameter range
distribution, ensuring stable, unbiased low-bit training. With Metis, FP8
training surpasses FP32 baselines, and FP4 training achieves accuracy
comparable to FP32, paving the way for robust and scalable LLM training under
advanced low-bit quantization. The code implementation for Metis is available

*Rahul Meshram,Kesav Kaza*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper focuses on multi-action partially observable restless multi-armed bandits (PORMAB), a generalization of classical restless multi-armed bandits with finite states and actions. It introduces a theoretical model aimed at solving long-term optimization, with applications in areas like public health intervention planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing real-world resource allocation problems where systems are partially observable, such as public healthcare outreach and recommendation systems.

Method: The paper analyzes the Lagrangian bound method and introduces computational approaches like point-based value iteration (PBVI) and online rollout policy for PORMAB optimization under budget constraints.

Result: The paper provides theoretical insights into value functions and techniques for PORMAB optimization and studies heuristic policies. It critiques the limitations of the traditional Whittle index in this novel setup.

Conclusion: Effective computational methods, like PBVI and online rollout policies, show promise but require further improvements, especially in cases where traditional methods like the Whittle index fall short.

Abstract: Partially observable restless multi-armed bandits have found numerous
applications including in recommendation systems, communication systems, public
healthcare outreach systems, and in operations research. We study multi-action
partially observable restless multi-armed bandits, it is a generalization of
the classical restless multi-armed bandit problem -- 1) each bandit has finite
states, and the current state is not observable, 2) each bandit has finite
actions. In particular, we assume that more than two actions are available for
each bandit. We motivate our problem with the application of public-health
intervention planning. We describe the model and formulate a long term
discounted optimization problem, where the state of each bandit evolves
according to a Markov process, and this evolution is action dependent. The
state of a bandit is not observable but one of finitely many feedback signals
are observable. Each bandit yields a reward, based on the action taken on that
bandit. The agent is assumed to have a budget constraint. The bandits are
assumed to be independent. However, they are weakly coupled at the agent
through the budget constraint.
  We first analyze the Lagrangian bound method for our partially observable
restless bandits. The computation of optimal value functions for finite-state,
finite-action POMDPs is non-trivial. Hence, the computation of Lagrangian
bounds is also challenging. We describe approximations for the computation of
Lagrangian bounds using point based value iteration (PBVI) and online rollout
policy. We further present various properties of the value functions and
provide theoretical insights on PBVI and online rollout policy. We study
heuristic policies for multi-actions PORMAB. Finally, we discuss present
Whittle index policies and their limitations in our model.

TL;DR: The paper explores the memorization limits of transformers in prompt tuning, proving linear information-scalability with prompt length and inherent memory constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To gain a theoretical understanding of the capabilities and limitations of prompt tuning in transformers, especially in terms of information retention.

Method: The authors used formal theoretical analyses to investigate the memorization capability of transformers and their performance with extended context lengths.

Result: The study found that the memorization capability scales linearly with the prompt length and that transformers face performance degradation when dealing with long sequences, due to inherent memory limitations.

Conclusion: Transformers, while powerful, have inherent memory constraints that limit their ability to handle long sequences effectively, highlighting a fundamental limitation of the architecture.

Abstract: Despite the empirical success of prompt tuning in adapting pretrained
language models to new tasks, theoretical analyses of its capabilities remain
limited. Existing theoretical work primarily addresses universal approximation
properties, demonstrating results comparable to standard weight tuning. In this
paper, we explore a different aspect of the theory of transformers: the
memorization capability of prompt tuning. We provide two principal theoretical
contributions. First, we prove that the amount of information memorized by a
transformer cannot scale faster than linearly with the prompt length. Second,
and more importantly, we present the first formal proof of a phenomenon
empirically observed in large language models: performance degradation in
transformers with extended contexts. We rigorously demonstrate that
transformers inherently have limited memory, constraining the amount of
information they can retain, regardless of the context size. This finding
offers a fundamental understanding of the intrinsic limitations of transformer
architectures, particularly their ability to handle long sequences.

TL;DR: The paper studies activation sparsity in modern large language models (LLMs) and proposes a general framework for assessing its robustness. Universal patterns and practical guidelines for model design are discussed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern LLMs abandoned ReLU activations in favor of other activation functions, creating challenges for studying activation sparsity, which is linked to efficiency, robustness, and interpretability.

Method: The authors designed a general framework to assess sparsity robustness and systematically studied activation sparsity in Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers of modern LLMs, including diffusion LLMs.

Result: The study identified universal patterns of activation sparsity in modern LLMs and insights into its behavior, contributing practical guidelines for leveraging sparsity in model acceleration and design.

Conclusion: Activation sparsity can be systematically understood in LLMs, enabling exploitation for improved model efficiency and optimization strategies.

Abstract: Input-dependent activation sparsity is a notable property of deep learning
models, which has been extensively studied in networks with ReLU activations
and is associated with efficiency, robustness, and interpretability. However,
the approaches developed for ReLU-based models depend on exact zero activations
and do not transfer directly to modern large language models~(LLMs), which have
abandoned ReLU in favor of other activation functions. As a result, current
work on activation sparsity in LLMs is fragmented, model-specific, and lacks
consensus on which components to target. We propose a general framework to
assess sparsity robustness and present a systematic study of the phenomenon in
the FFN layers of modern LLMs, including diffusion LLMs. Our findings reveal
universal patterns of activation sparsity in LLMs, provide insights into this
phenomenon, and offer practical guidelines for exploiting it in model design
and acceleration.

TL;DR: The paper investigates memorization issues in Image AutoRegressive (IAR) models and proposes interventions to mitigate privacy risks while preserving image generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns about the memorization of training data in IAR models and its implications for data privacy.

Method: Analyzed memorization patterns across different IAR architectures and intervened in memorizing components to reduce data extraction risks.

Result: Found differing memorization patterns in IAR architectures and successfully reduced memorization with minimal impact on image generation quality.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into memorization behavior and highlights mitigation strategies to enhance privacy in IAR models.

Abstract: Image AutoRegressive (IAR) models have achieved state-of-the-art performance
in speed and quality of generated images. However, they also raise concerns
about memorization of their training data and its implications for privacy.
This work explores where and how such memorization occurs within different
image autoregressive architectures by measuring a fine-grained memorization.
The analysis reveals that memorization patterns differ across various
architectures of IARs. In hierarchical per-resolution architectures, it tends
to emerge early and deepen with resolutions, while in IARs with standard
autoregressive per token prediction, it concentrates in later processing
stages. These localization of memorization patterns are further connected to
IARs' ability to memorize and leak training data. By intervening on their most
memorizing components, we significantly reduce the capacity for data extraction
from IARs with minimal impact on the quality of generated images. These
findings offer new insights into the internal behavior of image generative
models and point toward practical strategies for mitigating privacy risks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel Pattern-Spatial Interactive and Regional Awareness Graph Convolutional Network (PSIRAGCN) to address traffic forecasting issues by improving spatial-temporal correlation modeling and incorporating regional heterogeneity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous traffic forecasting models struggled to effectively model spatial-temporal correlations, neglected fusion between traffic patterns and spatial correlations, and failed to address regional heterogeneity during message-passing.

Method: Introduced PSIRAGCN with a pattern-spatial interactive framework and a graph convolutional network incorporating a regional characteristics bank to reconstruct message-passing with regional awareness.

Result: Extensive experiments on three real-world traffic datasets showcased PSIRAGCN’s superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines and its ability to balance computational costs.

Conclusion: PSIRAGCN successfully addresses challenges in traffic forecasting by leveraging interactive fusion and regional heterogeneity awareness, making it a promising tool for urban traffic management and intelligent route planning.

Abstract: Traffic forecasting is significant for urban traffic management, intelligent
route planning, and real-time flow monitoring. Recent advances in
spatial-temporal models have markedly improved the modeling of intricate
spatial-temporal correlations for traffic forecasting. Unfortunately, most
previous studies have encountered challenges in effectively modeling
spatial-temporal correlations across various perceptual perspectives, which
have neglected the interactive fusion between traffic patterns and spatial
correlations. Additionally, constrained by spatial heterogeneity, most studies
fail to consider distinct regional heterogeneity during message-passing. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a Pattern-Spatial Interactive and
Regional Awareness Graph Convolutional Network (PSIRAGCN) for traffic
forecasting. Specifically, we propose a pattern-spatial interactive fusion
framework composed of pattern and spatial modules. This framework aims to
capture patterns and spatial correlations by adopting a perception perspective
from the global to the local level and facilitating mutual utilization with
positive feedback. In the spatial module, we designed a graph convolutional
network based on message-passing. The network is designed to leverage a
regional characteristics bank to reconstruct data-driven message-passing with
regional awareness. Reconstructed message passing can reveal the regional

### [544] [Biological Pathway Informed Models with Graph Attention Networks (GATs)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00524)
*Gavin Wong,Ping Shu Ho,Ivan Au Yeung,Ka Chun Cheung,Simon See*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Graph Attention Network (GAT) method for modeling biological pathways at the gene level, achieving significant performance improvements and enabling recovery of crucial gene-gene interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ML models overlook the structure of biological pathways and gene-gene interactions, leading to suboptimal results in capturing pathway dynamics.

Method: The study employs a GAT framework to model pathways at the gene level, incorporating pathway topology and interventions to encode drug mechanisms.

Result: The GAT approach reduced MSE by 81% in pathway dynamics prediction under novel conditions, improved robustness, and rediscovered key gene interactions in experimental data.

Conclusion: The GAT-based framework effectively models biological pathways and opens avenues for generating new biological hypotheses from data, outperforming existing models.

Abstract: Biological pathways map gene-gene interactions that govern all human
processes. Despite their importance, most ML models treat genes as unstructured
tokens, discarding known pathway structure. The latest pathway-informed models
capture pathway-pathway interactions, but still treat each pathway as a "bag of
genes" via MLPs, discarding its topology and gene-gene interactions. We propose
a Graph Attention Network (GAT) framework that models pathways at the gene
level. We show that GATs generalize much better than MLPs, achieving an 81%
reduction in MSE when predicting pathway dynamics under unseen treatment
conditions. We further validate the correctness of our biological prior by
encoding drug mechanisms via edge interventions, boosting model robustness.
Finally, we show that our GAT model is able to correctly rediscover all five
gene-gene interactions in the canonical TP53-MDM2-MDM4 feedback loop from raw
time-series mRNA data, demonstrating potential to generate novel biological
hypotheses directly from experimental data.

### [545] [FedThief: Harming Others to Benefit Oneself in Self-Centered Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00540)
*Xiangyu Zhang,Mang Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel attack paradigm in federated learning where attackers aim to deteriorate the global model while simultaneously enhancing their private models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated learning attacks degrade the global model but don’t benefit the attackers due to their own private model deterioration. Real-world attackers are motivated to gain competitive advantages by outperforming others rather than causing mere disruption.

Method: A method called FedThief is introduced, which degrades the global model's performance by uploading modified content. It also uses divergence-aware ensemble techniques to combine updates and local knowledge to strengthen attackers' private models.

Result: FedThief effectively damages the global model while enabling attackers to construct a private ensemble model that surpasses the performance of the federated global model.

Conclusion: The study highlights the risks in federated learning systems posed by motivated attackers, showcasing how attackers can harm collective learning while selfishly benefiting their private models.

Abstract: In federated learning, participants' uploaded model updates cannot be
directly verified, leaving the system vulnerable to malicious attacks. Existing
attack strategies have adversaries upload tampered model updates to degrade the
global model's performance. However, attackers also degrade their own private
models, gaining no advantage. In real-world scenarios, attackers are driven by
self-centered motives: their goal is to gain a competitive advantage by
developing a model that outperforms those of other participants, not merely to
cause disruption. In this paper, we study a novel Self-Centered Federated
Learning (SCFL) attack paradigm, in which attackers not only degrade the
performance of the global model through attacks but also enhance their own
models within the federated learning process. We propose a framework named
FedThief, which degrades the performance of the global model by uploading
modified content during the upload stage. At the same time, it enhances the
private model's performance through divergence-aware ensemble techniques, where
"divergence" quantifies the deviation between private and global models, that
integrate global updates and local knowledge. Extensive experiments show that
our method effectively degrades the global model performance while allowing the
attacker to obtain an ensemble model that significantly outperforms the global
model.

### [546] [Advanced spectral clustering for heterogeneous data in credit risk monitoring systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00546)
*Lu Han,Mengyan Li,Jiping Qiang,Zhi Su*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Advanced Spectral Clustering (ASC) for combining numerical and textual data in credit monitoring. ASC improves clustering effectiveness significantly and provides actionable insights for financial risk assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the complexities of integrating numerical financial variables and textual records for effective credit risk assessment and monitoring.

Method: ASC combines financial and textual similarities through an optimized weight parameter and performs eigenvector selection using eigenvalue-silhouette optimization. It is evaluated across various clustering algorithms.

Result: ASC achieves a Silhouette score 18% higher than baseline methods, identifies low-risk firms with specific textual patterns, and confirms robustness across different clustering techniques.

Conclusion: ASC proves effective for clustering heterogeneous data in financial applications, enabling improved credit monitoring and actionable insights for targeted interventions.

Abstract: Heterogeneous data, which encompass both numerical financial variables and
textual records, present substantial challenges for credit monitoring. To
address this issue, we propose Advanced Spectral Clustering (ASC), a method
that integrates financial and textual similarities through an optimized weight
parameter and selects eigenvectors using a novel eigenvalue-silhouette
optimization approach. Evaluated on a dataset comprising 1,428 small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), ASC achieves a Silhouette score that is 18%
higher than that of a single-type data baseline method. Furthermore, the
resulting clusters offer actionable insights; for instance, 51% of low-risk
firms are found to include the term 'social recruitment' in their textual
records. The robustness of ASC is confirmed across multiple clustering
algorithms, including k-means, k-medians, and k-medoids, with
{\Delta}Intra/Inter < 0.13 and {\Delta}Silhouette Coefficient < 0.02. By
bridging spectral clustering theory with heterogeneous data applications, ASC
enables the identification of meaningful clusters, such as recruitment-focused
SMEs exhibiting a 30% lower default risk, thereby supporting more targeted and
effective credit interventions.

*Lu Han,Xiuying Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduces the Integrated Multivariate Segmentation Tree (IMST) for credit evaluation, which combines financial and textual data and achieves better accuracy and interpretability than traditional decision models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional decision trees struggle with high-dimensional data and textual integration, hindering their effectiveness in credit evaluation for SMEs.

Method: The IMST methodology involves three key steps: matrix factorization for textual data, financial feature selection via Lasso regression, and constructing a segmentation tree using Gini index or Entropy with pruning to control complexity.

Result: IMST achieved an accuracy of 88.9% in classifying credit risks for SMEs, outperforming both baseline decision trees (87.4%) and conventional models like logistic regression and SVM.

Conclusion: The IMST model improves credit evaluation by balancing accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency, making it an effective tool for analyzing SME data.

Abstract: Traditional decision tree models, which rely exclusively on numerical
variables, often encounter difficulties in handling high-dimensional data and
fail to effectively incorporate textual information. To address these
limitations, we propose the Integrated Multivariate Segmentation Tree (IMST), a
comprehensive framework designed to enhance credit evaluation for small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) by integrating financial data with textual
sources. The methodology comprises three core stages: (1) transforming textual
data into numerical matrices through matrix factorization; (2) selecting
salient financial features using Lasso regression; and (3) constructing a
multivariate segmentation tree based on the Gini index or Entropy, with
weakest-link pruning applied to regulate model complexity. Experimental results
derived from a dataset of 1,428 Chinese SMEs demonstrate that IMST achieves an
accuracy of 88.9%, surpassing baseline decision trees (87.4%) as well as
conventional models such as logistic regression and support vector machines
(SVM). Furthermore, the proposed model exhibits superior interpretability and
computational efficiency, featuring a more streamlined architecture and
enhanced risk detection capabilities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'trancit,' an open-source Python toolbox designed for investigating transient causal interactions in neural signals, offering methodologies that outperform traditional techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors highlight the challenge of quantifying transient causal interactions in neural signals using traditional methods and the lack of accessible Python implementations for event-specific techniques.

Method: TranCIT combines techniques such as Granger Causality, Transfer Entropy, and Structural Causal Model-based measures like Dynamic Causal Strength (DCS) and relative DCS (rDCS) within an open-source Python package.

Result: The toolbox successfully detects causality in high-synchrony neural regimes where traditional methods fail and identifies known transient information flow during sharp-wave ripple events in hippocampal regions.

Conclusion: TranCIT provides a validated, user-friendly solution for analyzing transient causal dynamics in complex neural systems, bridging methodological and implementation gaps.

Abstract: Quantifying transient causal interactions from non-stationary neural signals
is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience. Traditional methods are often
inadequate for brief neural events, and advanced, event-specific techniques
have lacked accessible implementations within the Python ecosystem. Here, we
introduce trancit (Transient Causal Interaction Toolbox), an open-source Python
package designed to bridge this gap. TranCIT implements a comprehensive
analysis pipeline, including Granger Causality, Transfer Entropy, and the more
robust Structural Causal Model-based Dynamic Causal Strength (DCS) and relative
Dynamic Causal Strength (rDCS) for accurately detecting event-driven causal
effects. We demonstrate TranCIT's utility by successfully capturing causality
in high-synchrony regimes where traditional methods fail and by identifying the
known transient information flow from hippocampal CA3 to CA1 during sharp-wave
ripple events in real-world data. The package offers a user-friendly, validated
solution for investigating the transient causal dynamics that govern complex
systems.

*Shikun Liu,Deyu Zou,Nima Shoghi,Victor Fung,Kai Liu,Pan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates fine-tuning approaches for molecular graph foundation models (MGFMs) under challenging conditions, culminating in the design of the ROFT-MOL method for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In the field of molecular graph foundation models, the need for effective fine-tuning is highlighted by challenges like data scarcity and the requirement to handle regression and classification tasks, which necessitate robust methods to enhance generalization.

Method: The paper categorizes eight fine-tuning techniques into three mechanisms: weight-based, representation-based, and partial fine-tuning. These methods are benchmarked on downstream regression and classification tasks for both supervised and self-supervised pre-trained models under diverse labeling setups.

Result: The study provides actionable insights from an extensive evaluation and introduces ROFT-MOL, which blends post-hoc weight interpolation with weight ensemble fine-tuning, achieving enhanced task performance while remaining user-friendly.

Conclusion: ROFT-MOL is presented as an effective and practical fine-tuning solution that leverages insights from multiple methods to tackle the unique challenges of molecular graph foundation models.

Abstract: In the era of foundation models, fine-tuning pre-trained models for specific
downstream tasks has become crucial. This drives the need for robust
fine-tuning methods to address challenges such as model overfitting and sparse
labeling. Molecular graph foundation models (MGFMs) face unique difficulties
that complicate fine-tuning. These models are limited by smaller pre-training
datasets and more severe data scarcity for downstream tasks, both of which
require enhanced model generalization. Moreover, MGFMs must accommodate diverse
objectives, including both regression and classification tasks. To better
understand and improve fine-tuning techniques under these conditions, we
classify eight fine-tuning methods into three mechanisms: weight-based,
representation-based, and partial fine-tuning. We benchmark these methods on
downstream regression and classification tasks across supervised and
self-supervised pre-trained models in diverse labeling settings. This extensive
evaluation provides valuable insights and informs the design of a refined
robust fine-tuning method, ROFT-MOL. This approach combines the strengths of
simple post-hoc weight interpolation with more complex weight ensemble
fine-tuning methods, delivering improved performance across both task types
while maintaining the ease of use inherent in post-hoc weight interpolation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a machine learning framework using Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFT) to forecast Total Electron Content (TEC) of the ionosphere, achieving notable accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate prediction of ionospheric variability is challenging due to nonlinear interactions among solar, geomagnetic, and thermospheric factors, compounded by sparse global GNSS data and limited empirical model performance.

Method: The method involves leveraging TFTs to predict ionosphere TEC by integrating diverse inputs, such as solar irradiance, geomagnetic indices, and GNSS-derived TEC, with preprocessing and temporal alignment strategies.

Result: The model demonstrates robust 24-hour TEC forecasting from 2010-2025, achieving root mean square errors as low as 3.33 TECU, with solar EUV irradiance identified as the strongest predictor.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides accurate and interpretable ionospheric TEC predictions, benefits scientific and operational applications, and is made publicly available as an open-source toolkit named 	exttt{ionopy}.

Abstract: The ionosphere critically influences Global Navigation Satellite Systems
(GNSS), satellite communications, and Low Earth Orbit (LEO) operations, yet
accurate prediction of its variability remains challenging due to nonlinear
couplings between solar, geomagnetic, and thermospheric drivers. Total Electron
Content (TEC), a key ionospheric parameter, is derived from GNSS observations,
but its reliable forecasting is limited by the sparse nature of global
measurements and the limited accuracy of empirical models, especially during
strong space weather conditions. In this work, we present a machine learning
framework for ionospheric TEC forecasting that leverages Temporal Fusion
Transformers (TFT) to predict sparse ionosphere data. Our approach accommodates
heterogeneous input sources, including solar irradiance, geomagnetic indices,
and GNSS-derived vertical TEC, and applies preprocessing and temporal alignment
strategies. Experiments spanning 2010-2025 demonstrate that the model achieves
robust predictions up to 24 hours ahead, with root mean square errors as low as
3.33 TECU. Results highlight that solar EUV irradiance provides the strongest
predictive signals. Beyond forecasting accuracy, the framework offers
interpretability through attention-based analysis, supporting both operational
applications and scientific discovery. To encourage reproducibility and
community-driven development, we release the full implementation as the
open-source toolkit \texttt{ionopy}.

### [552] [Disentangling Slow and Fast Temporal Dynamics in Degradation Inference with Hierarchical Differential Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00639)
*Mengjie Zhao,Olga Fink*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a Hierarchical Controlled Differential Equation (H-CDE) framework for disentangling system degradation from operational variability in sensor data, achieving superior degradation inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: System degradation in engineered systems is challenging to infer due to its subtle, long-term nature compared to more dominant short-term operational variations.

Method: The authors propose the H-CDE framework, which includes multi-scale time integration to reduce numerical stiffness, a learnable path transformation for extracting latent drivers of degradation, and a novel activation function enforcing monotonicity.

Result: The H-CDE framework demonstrated better performance in degradation disentanglement compared to residual-based baselines, with applications on dynamic and steady-state systems.

Conclusion: H-CDE provides a robust and interpretable solution for accurately inferring degradation from sensor data, addressing key limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Reliable inference of system degradation from sensor data is fundamental to
condition monitoring and prognostics in engineered systems. Since degradation
is rarely observable and measurable, it must be inferred to enable accurate
health assessment and decision-making. This is particularly challenging because
operational variations dominate system behavior, while degradation introduces
only subtle, long-term changes. Consequently, sensor data mainly reflect
short-term operational variability, making it difficult to disentangle the
underlying degradation process. Residual-based methods are widely employed, but
the residuals remain entangled with operational history, often resulting in
noisy and unreliable degradation estimation, particularly in systems with
dynamic responses. Neural Ordinary Equations (NODEs) offer a promising
framework for inferring latent dynamics, but the time-scale separation in
slow-fast systems introduces numerical stiffness and complicates training,
while degradation disentanglement remains difficult. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel Hierarchical Controlled Differential Equation
(H-CDE) framework that incorporates a slow (degradation) and a fast (operation)
CDE component in a unified architecture. It introduces three key innovations: a
multi-scale time integration scheme to mitigate numerical stiffness; a
learnable path transformation that extracts latent degradation drivers to
control degradation evolution; and a novel activation function that enforces
monotonicity on inferred degradation as a regularizer for disentanglement.
Through comprehensive evaluations on both dynamic response (e.g., bridges) and
steady state (e.g., aero-engine) systems, we demonstrate that H-CDE effectively
disentangles degradation from operational dynamics and outperforms
residual-based baselines, yielding more accurate, robust, and interpretable
inference.

*Zhipeng Yin,Zichong Wang,Avash Palikhe,Zhen Liu,Jun Liu,Wenbin Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the AMCR framework to reduce copyright risks in generative models through advanced prompt restructuring, similarity analysis, and adaptive risk mitigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models excel in text-to-image tasks but pose copyright risks by potentially replicating copyrighted elements, necessitating methods to address these challenges for real-world applications.

Method: The AMCR framework includes three components: restructuring user prompts to avoid risky content, detecting partial infringements via attention-based similarity analysis, and adaptively mitigating risks during image generation.

Result: AMCR is validated through extensive experiments, proving its ability to reveal and reduce copyright risks without compromising the quality of generated images.

Conclusion: AMCR provides a practical and effective way to tackle copyright risks in generative models, contributing to safer deployment while maintaining creative output quality.

Abstract: Generative models have achieved impressive results in text to image tasks,
significantly advancing visual content creation. However, this progress comes
at a cost, as such models rely heavily on large-scale training data and may
unintentionally replicate copyrighted elements, creating serious legal and
ethical challenges for real-world deployment. To address these concerns,
researchers have proposed various strategies to mitigate copyright risks, most
of which are prompt based methods that filter or rewrite user inputs to prevent
explicit infringement. While effective in handling obvious cases, these
approaches often fall short in more subtle situations, where seemingly benign
prompts can still lead to infringing outputs. To address these limitations,
this paper introduces Assessing and Mitigating Copyright Risks (AMCR), a
comprehensive framework which i) builds upon prompt-based strategies by
systematically restructuring risky prompts into safe and non-sensitive forms,
ii) detects partial infringements through attention-based similarity analysis,
and iii) adaptively mitigates risks during generation to reduce copyright
violations without compromising image quality. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of AMCR in revealing and mitigating latent copyright risks,
offering practical insights and benchmarks for the safer deployment of
generative models.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel way to impute missing tabular data using Neural Cellular Automata (NCA). The proposed method demonstrates improved performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the persistent challenge of missing data in tabular datasets. While generative models like Variational Autoencoders and Generative Adversarial Networks have been explored for imputation, Neural Cellular Automata has been overlooked despite its computational potential.

Method: The study adapts Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) into a framework for missing data imputation, incorporating specific modifications to enable effective handling of the task.

Result: The proposed NCA-based method shows superior imputation accuracy and improved post-imputation performance compared to other leading approaches.

Conclusion: Neural Cellular Automata can be effectively adapted for data imputation tasks. The model outperforms established methods, highlighting its potential for broader applications in handling missing data.

Abstract: When working with tabular data, missingness is always one of the most painful
problems. Throughout many years, researchers have continuously explored better
and better ways to impute missing data. Recently, with the rapid development
evolution in machine learning and deep learning, there is a new trend of
leveraging generative models to solve the imputation task. While the imputing
version of famous models such as Variational Autoencoders or Generative
Adversarial Networks were investigated, prior work has overlooked Neural
Cellular Automata (NCA), a powerful computational model. In this paper, we
propose a novel imputation method that is inspired by NCA. We show that, with
some appropriate adaptations, an NCA-based model is able to address the missing
data imputation problem. We also provide several experiments to evidence that
our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of imputation error and
post-imputation performance.

IndiaWeatherBench provides a curated dataset built from high-resolution
regional reanalysis products, along with a suite of deterministic and
probabilistic metrics to facilitate consistent training and evaluation. To
establish strong baselines, we implement and evaluate a range of models across
diverse architectures, including UNets, Transformers, and Graph-based networks,
as well as different boundary conditioning strategies and training objectives.
While focused on India, IndiaWeatherBench is easily extensible to other
geographic regions. We open-source all raw and preprocessed datasets, model
implementations, and evaluation pipelines to promote accessibility and future
development. We hope IndiaWeatherBench will serve as a foundation for advancing
regional weather forecasting research. Code is available at

TL;DR: VECTOR+ is a framework that combines property-guided learning and generative modeling to create high-quality drug candidates under low-data constraints, outperforming benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of steering generative models in drug discovery to pharmacologically relevant regions, especially when limited training data is available.

Method: The authors developed VECTOR+, which integrates property-enhanced contrastive learning and molecule generation. It applies to both classification and regression tasks, allowing exploration of chemical spaces efficiently.

Result: VECTOR+ generated novel candidates for PD-L1 and kinase inhibitors, demonstrating stronger docking scores and retainment of critical pharmacophores. It outperformed models like JT-VAE and MolGPT in several key metrics.

Conclusion: VECTOR+ is a scalable and superior framework for molecular design, demonstrating reproducibility and applicability to low-data settings in drug discovery.

Abstract: Efficiently steering generative models toward pharmacologically relevant
regions of chemical space remains a major obstacle in molecular drug discovery
under low-data regimes. We present VECTOR+: Valid-property-Enhanced Contrastive
Learning for Targeted Optimization and Resampling, a framework that couples
property-guided representation learning with controllable molecule generation.
VECTOR+ applies to both regression and classification tasks and enables
interpretable, data-efficient exploration of functional chemical space. We
evaluate on two datasets: a curated PD-L1 inhibitor set (296 compounds with
experimental $IC_{50}$ values) and a receptor kinase inhibitor set (2,056
molecules by binding mode). Despite limited training data, VECTOR+ generates
novel, synthetically tractable candidates. Against PD-L1 (PDB 5J89), 100 of
8,374 generated molecules surpass a docking threshold of $-15.0$ kcal/mol, with
the best scoring $-17.6$ kcal/mol compared to the top reference inhibitor
($-15.4$ kcal/mol). The best-performing molecules retain the conserved biphenyl
pharmacophore while introducing novel motifs. Molecular dynamics (250 ns)
confirm binding stability (ligand RMSD < $2.5$ angstroms). VECTOR+ generalizes
to kinase inhibitors, producing compounds with stronger docking scores than
established drugs such as brigatinib and sorafenib. Benchmarking against JT-VAE
and MolGPT across docking, novelty, uniqueness, and Tanimoto similarity
highlights the superior performance of our method. These results position our
work as a robust, extensible approach for property-conditioned molecular design
in low-data settings, bridging contrastive learning and generative modeling for
reproducible, AI-accelerated discovery.

*Arun Vignesh Malarkkan,Haoyue Bai,Anjali Kaushik,Yanjie Fu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DELTA, a privacy-preserving data transformation framework that boosts target attribute prediction and reduces sensitive attribute inferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sensitive data often needs transformations to comply with privacy regulations like HIPAA and GDPR while maintaining task performance and reducing privacy leakage.

Method: DELTA is a two-phase framework: Phase I optimizes transformations using policy-guided reinforcement learning for utility; Phase II uses a variational LSTM framework to disentangle utility and privacy signals.

Result: DELTA enhances predictive accuracy by approximately 9.3% and reduces privacy leakage by ~35% across eight datasets.

Conclusion: DELTA demonstrates robust capabilities in creating privacy-conscious, high-utility data transformations, addressing challenges of large search spaces and disentangling sensitive information.

Abstract: In real-world applications, domain data often contains identifiable or
sensitive attributes, is subject to strict regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR), and
requires explicit data feature engineering for interpretability and
transparency. Existing feature engineering primarily focuses on advancing
downstream task performance, often risking privacy leakage. We generalize this
learning task under such new requirements as Privacy-Preserving Data
Reprogramming (PPDR): given a dataset, transforming features to maximize target
attribute prediction accuracy while minimizing sensitive attribute prediction
accuracy. PPDR poses challenges for existing systems: 1) generating
high-utility feature transformations without being overwhelmed by a large
search space, and 2) disentangling and eliminating sensitive information from
utility-oriented features to reduce privacy inferability. To tackle these
challenges, we propose DELTA, a two-phase variational disentangled generative
learning framework. Phase I uses policy-guided reinforcement learning to
discover feature transformations with downstream task utility, without any
regard to privacy inferability. Phase II employs a variational LSTM seq2seq
encoder-decoder with a utility-privacy disentangled latent space design and
adversarial-causal disentanglement regularization to suppress privacy signals
during feature generation. Experiments on eight datasets show DELTA improves
predictive performance by ~9.3% and reduces privacy leakage by ~35%,
demonstrating robust, privacy-aware data transformation.

*Osama Ahmad,Lukas Wesemann,Fabian Waschkowski,Zubair Khalid*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Mode Adaptive Graph Network (MAGN) to address limitations of current methods in spatiotemporal forecasting, achieving significant efficiency and accuracy gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph neural networks struggle with volatility patterns and spectral entanglement, while decomposition methods improve accuracy but are computationally inefficient and require manual tuning.

Method: Introduces MAGN featuring an Unfolded Variational Mode Decomposition (UVMD) module which reduces decomposition time significantly and includes learnable mode-specific bandwidth to adapt spatial heterogeneity.

Result: MAGN demonstrated improved performance, reducing prediction error by 85-95% compared to VMGCN, and outperformed state-of-the-art baselines on a large benchmark dataset.

Conclusion: MAGN successfully addresses computational inefficiency and manual tuning issues, presenting a scalable and accurate framework for spatiotemporal forecasting.

Abstract: Accurate spatiotemporal forecasting is critical for numerous complex systems
but remains challenging due to complex volatility patterns and spectral
entanglement in conventional graph neural networks (GNNs). While
decomposition-integrated approaches like variational mode graph convolutional
network (VMGCN) improve accuracy through signal decomposition, they suffer from
computational inefficiency and manual hyperparameter tuning. To address these
limitations, we propose the mode adaptive graph network (MAGN) that transforms
iterative variational mode decomposition (VMD) into a trainable neural module.
Our key innovations include (1) an unfolded VMD (UVMD) module that replaces
iterative optimization with a fixed-depth network to reduce the decomposition

bandwidth constraints ({\alpha}k ) adapt spatial heterogeneity and eliminate
manual tuning while preventing spectral overlap. Evaluated on the LargeST

in the prediction error over VMGCN and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

*Renfei Zhang,Mohit Pandey,Artem Cherkasov,Martin Ester*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces BALD-GFlowNet, a scalable generative active learning framework that improves efficiency in drug discovery by reducing computational costs while maintaining effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the computational limitations of pool-based active learning, particularly in virtual screening for drug discovery, where evaluating large datasets is challenging.

Method: Proposed a generative active learning framework, BALD-GFlowNet, that uses Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to sample objects proportionally to the BALD reward, bypassing the need for exhaustive pool-based evaluation.

Result: Demonstrated that BALD-GFlowNet performs comparably to traditional BALD strategies in virtual screening while generating more structurally diverse molecules.

Conclusion: BALD-GFlowNet offers a scalable and efficient approach to active learning, benefiting molecular discovery by overcoming computational constraints and enhancing diversity.

Abstract: The scalability of pool-based active learning is limited by the computational
cost of evaluating large unlabeled datasets, a challenge that is particularly
acute in virtual screening for drug discovery. While active learning strategies
such as Bayesian Active Learning by Disagreement (BALD) prioritize informative
samples, it remains computationally intensive when scaled to libraries
containing billions samples. In this work, we introduce BALD-GFlowNet, a
generative active learning framework that circumvents this issue. Our method
leverages Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to directly sample objects in
proportion to the BALD reward. By replacing traditional pool-based acquisition
with generative sampling, BALD-GFlowNet achieves scalability that is
independent of the size of the unlabeled pool. In our virtual screening
experiment, we show that BALD-GFlowNet achieves a performance comparable to
that of standard BALD baseline while generating more structurally diverse
molecules, offering a promising direction for efficient and scalable molecular
discovery.

### [560] [Task-Aware Adaptive Modulation: A Replay-Free and Resource-Efficient Approach For Continual Graph Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00735)
*Jingtao Liu,Xinming Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in Continual Graph Learning (CGL) by introducing a resource-efficient, replay-free approach using lightweight task-specific modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve issues in CGL, such as the stability-plasticity dilemma and reliance on resource-heavy pre-training methods.

Method: The authors propose Task-Aware Adaptive Modulation (TAAM), which utilizes frozen neural synapse modulators (NSMs) for dynamic computational flow regulation in a frozen GNN backbone.

Result: TAAM demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across six GCIL benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: TAAM offers a promising resource-efficient solution to CGL challenges without heavy reliance on pre-training or extensive storage.

Abstract: Continual Graph Learning(CGL)focuses on acquiring new knowledge while
retaining previously learned information, essential for real-world graph
applications. Current methods grapple with two main issues:1) The
Stability-Plasticity Dilemma: Replay-based methods often create an imbalance
between the Dilemma, while incurring significant storage costs.2) The
Resource-Heavy Pre-training: Leading replay-free methods critically depend on
extensively pre-trained backbones, this reliance imposes a substantial resource
burden.In this paper, we argue that the key to overcoming these challenges lies
not in replaying data or fine-tuning the entire network, but in dynamically
modulating the internal computational flow of a frozen backbone. We posit that
lightweight, task-specific modules can effectively steer a GNN's reasoning
process. Motivated by this insight, we propose Task-Aware Adaptive
Modulation(TAAM), a replay-free, resource-efficient approach that charts a new
path for navigating the stability-plasticity dilemma. TAAM's core is its Neural
Synapse Modulators(NSM), which are trained and then frozen for each task to
store expert knowledge. A pivotal prototype-guided strategy governs these
modulators: 1) For training, it initializes a new NSM by deep-copying from a
similar past modulator to boost knowledge transfer. 2) For inference, it
selects the most relevant frozen NSM for each task. These NSMs insert into a
frozen GNN backbone to perform fine-grained, node-attentive modulation of its
internal flow-different from the static perturbations of prior methods.
Extensive experiments show that TAAM comprehensively outperforms
state-of-the-art methods across six GCIL benchmark datasets. The code will be
released upon acceptance of the paper.

*Qiying Hu,Yingying Liang,Qianli Zhou,Witold Pedrycz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper improves traditional Dempster-Shafer Theory-based classifiers for multi-attribute classification by introducing enhanced modeling strategies and belief structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional DST-based classifiers in handling complexity and uncertainty in real-world scenarios.

Method: The paper employs selective modeling for membership functions using Gaussian models, and proposes a novel BPA transformation method that enriches uncertain information representation.

Result: Comprehensive experiments show the proposed classifiers outperform existing evidential classifiers with a 4.84% accuracy increase and lower variance.

Conclusion: The enhanced DST-based classifiers offer superior effectiveness and robustness for handling complex classification tasks under uncertainty.

Abstract: Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) provides a powerful framework for modeling
uncertainty and has been widely applied to multi-attribute classification
tasks. However, traditional DST-based attribute fusion-based classifiers suffer
from oversimplified membership function modeling and limited exploitation of
the belief structure brought by basic probability assignment (BPA), reducing
their effectiveness in complex real-world scenarios. This paper presents an
enhanced attribute fusion-based classifier that addresses these limitations
through two key innovations. First, we adopt a selective modeling strategy that
utilizes both single Gaussian and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) for membership
function construction, with model selection guided by cross-validation and a
tailored evaluation metric. Second, we introduce a novel method to transform
the possibility distribution into a BPA by combining simple BPAs derived from
normalized possibility distributions, enabling a much richer and more flexible
representation of uncertain information. Furthermore, we apply the belief
structure-based BPA generation method to the evidential K-Nearest Neighbors
classifier, enhancing its ability to incorporate uncertainty information into
decision-making. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets are conducted
to evaluate the performance of the proposed attribute fusion-based classifier
and the enhanced evidential K-Nearest Neighbors classifier in comparison with
both evidential classifiers and conventional machine learning classifiers. The
results demonstrate that our proposed classifier outperforms the best existing
evidential classifier, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 4.84%,
while maintaining low variance, thus confirming its superior effectiveness and
robustness.

### [562] [Flow Matters: Directional and Expressive GNNs for Heterophilic Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00772)
*Arman Gupta,Govind Waghmare,Gaurav Oberoi,Nitish Srivastava*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates how edge directionality and expressive message passing collectively improve node classification in heterophilic graphs, proposing two architectures, Poly and Dir-Poly, which achieve state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional GNNs underperform in heterophilic graphs due to reliance on local homophilous neighborhoods. Exploring edge directionality and polynomially expressive GNNs can bridge this gap and improve node classification performance.

Method: The authors introduce two architectures: Poly, a polynomially expressive GAT baseline, and Dir-Poly, a direction-aware variant that processes incoming and outgoing edges separately while maintaining scalability.

Result: Poly consistently surpasses existing baseline models across five heterophilic datasets, and Dir-Poly achieves state-of-the-art results in graphs with intrinsic directionality. Artificial directionality on undirected graphs is context-dependent and not universally beneficial.

Conclusion: Edge directionality and expressive feature modeling play complementary roles in heterophilic graph learning, with directional message passing being conditionally effective.

Abstract: In heterophilic graphs, where neighboring nodes often belong to different
classes, conventional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) struggle due to their
reliance on local homophilous neighborhoods. Prior studies suggest that
modeling edge directionality in such graphs can increase effective homophily
and improve classification performance. Simultaneously, recent work on
polynomially expressive GNNs shows promise in capturing higher-order
interactions among features. In this work, we study the combined effect of edge
directionality and expressive message passing on node classification in
heterophilic graphs. Specifically, we propose two architectures: (1) a
polynomially expressive GAT baseline (Poly), and (2) a direction-aware variant
(Dir-Poly) that separately aggregates incoming and outgoing edges. Both models
are designed to learn permutation-equivariant high-degree polynomials over
input features, while remaining scalable with no added time complexity.
Experiments on five benchmark heterophilic datasets show that our Poly model
consistently outperforms existing baselines, and that Dir-Poly offers
additional gains on graphs with inherent directionality (e.g., Roman Empire),
achieving state-of-the-art results. Interestingly, on undirected graphs,
introducing artificial directionality does not always help, suggesting that the
benefit of directional message passing is context-dependent. Our findings
highlight the complementary roles of edge direction and expressive feature
modeling in heterophilic graph learning.

### [563] [ProCause: Generating Counterfactual Outcomes to Evaluate Prescriptive Process Monitoring Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00797)
*Jakob De Moor,Hans Weytjens,Johannes De Smedt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProCause improves the evaluation of process optimization interventions by utilizing diverse causal inference models and incorporating temporal dependencies for better reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like RealCause inadequately handle temporal dependencies in process data and rely on a single CI model architecture, limiting their effectiveness in evaluating intervention outcomes.

Method: ProCause integrates sequential and non-sequential models, including LSTMs and various CI architectures, such as S-Learner, T-Learner, TARNet, and an ensemble approach.

Result: An ensemble of models proved more reliable than TARNet alone, while LSTMs demonstrated enhanced evaluations when temporal dependencies are present. Simulations with known ground truths and real-world data validated the practicality of ProCause.

Conclusion: ProCause provides a robust, versatile framework for evaluating Prescriptive Process Monitoring methods, enabling consistent and effective interventions tailored to process data.

Abstract: Prescriptive Process Monitoring (PresPM) is the subfield of Process Mining
that focuses on optimizing processes through real-time interventions based on
event log data. Evaluating PresPM methods is challenging due to the lack of
ground-truth outcomes for all intervention actions in datasets. A generative
deep learning approach from the field of Causal Inference (CI), RealCause, has
been commonly used to estimate the outcomes for proposed intervention actions
to evaluate a new policy. However, RealCause overlooks the temporal
dependencies in process data, and relies on a single CI model architecture,
TARNet, limiting its effectiveness. To address both shortcomings, we introduce
ProCause, a generative approach that supports both sequential (e.g., LSTMs) and
non-sequential models while integrating multiple CI architectures (S-Learner,
T-Learner, TARNet, and an ensemble). Our research using a simulator with known
ground truths reveals that TARNet is not always the best choice; instead, an
ensemble of models offers more consistent reliability, and leveraging LSTMs
shows potential for improved evaluations when temporal dependencies are
present. We further validate ProCause's practical effectiveness through a
real-world data analysis, ensuring a more reliable evaluation of PresPM
methods.

TL;DR: The paper surveys fairness issues within Federated Learning (FL) caused by heterogeneities like data and client biases, explores mitigation strategies, and discusses evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FL aims to enable collaborative model training across clients while ensuring data privacy, but fairness concerns from system heterogeneities hinder its applicability.

Method: The survey categorizes bias sources and assesses state-of-the-art techniques for fairness mitigation in FL. It also elaborates on fairness notions, theoretical bases, and evaluation metrics.

Result: Provides a detailed overview of biases in FL and reviews mitigation strategies, including existing technologies and fairness evaluations.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes fairness as a critical aspect for FL's advancement, identifying research gaps and directions for developing more equitable frameworks.

Abstract: At the intersection of the cutting-edge technologies and privacy concerns,
Federated Learning (FL) with its distributed architecture, stands at the
forefront in a bid to facilitate collaborative model training across multiple
clients while preserving data privacy. However, the applicability of FL systems
is hindered by fairness concerns arising from numerous sources of heterogeneity
that can result in biases and undermine a system's effectiveness, with skewed
predictions, reduced accuracy, and inefficient model convergence. This survey
thus explores the diverse sources of bias, including but not limited to, data,
client, and model biases, and thoroughly discusses the strengths and
limitations inherited within the array of the state-of-the-art techniques
utilized in the literature to mitigate such disparities in the FL training
process. We delineate a comprehensive overview of the several notions,
theoretical underpinnings, and technical aspects associated with fairness and
their adoption in FL-based multidisciplinary environments. Furthermore, we
examine salient evaluation metrics leveraged to measure fairness
quantitatively. Finally, we envisage exciting open research directions that
have the potential to drive future advancements in achieving fairer FL
frameworks, in turn, offering a strong foundation for future research in this
pivotal area.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve road safety, efficiency, and personalize user experiences, the paper addresses the lack of interpretability in black-box deep learning models.

Method: The paper proposes ML models such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and SVM, combined with SHAP explainability techniques, using a new dataset called CARLA-Drive.

Result: The approach achieved an accuracy of 0.92 for three-class driving style classification, demonstrating parity with DL models in performance.

Conclusion: The study suggests that interpretable and efficient ML methods can be practical alternatives to DL models for driving style classification in intelligent transportation systems.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in the automotive industry
for applications such as driving style classification, which aims to improve
road safety, efficiency, and personalize user experiences. While deep learning
(DL) models, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, excel at this
task, their black-box nature limits interpretability and trust. This paper
proposes a machine learning (ML)-based method that balances high accuracy with
interpretability. We introduce a high-quality dataset, CARLA-Drive, and
leverage ML techniques like Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting (XGBoost),
and Support Vector Machine (SVM), which are efficient, lightweight, and
interpretable. In addition, we apply the SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations)
explainability technique to provide personalized recommendations for safer
driving. Achieving an accuracy of 0.92 on a three-class classification task
with both RF and XGBoost classifiers, our approach matches DL models in
performance while offering transparency and practicality for real-world
deployment in intelligent transportation systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel method using a differentiable assignment scheme (Sinkhorn algorithm) to predict crystal structures, surpassing current methods in accuracy and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate prediction of 3D crystal structures, crucial in materials design, is challenging, especially for organic materials. Existing models are computationally intensive and insufficiently effective.

Method: Introduce a differentiable loss function that captures geometric molecular properties and ensures permutation invariance using the Sinkhorn algorithm.

Result: The new method, "SinkFast," outperformed more complicated state-of-the-art flow-matching models on the COD-Cluster17 benchmark.

Conclusion: The proposed approach simplifies and enhances the crystal structure prediction process, showing notable accuracy and efficiency compared to iterative methods.

Abstract: Crystalline structure prediction remains an open challenge in materials
design. Despite recent advances in computational materials science, accurately
predicting the three-dimensional crystal structures of organic materials--an
essential first step for designing materials with targeted properties--remains
elusive. In this work, we address the problem of molecular assembly, where a
set $\mathcal{S}$ of identical rigid molecules is packed to form a crystalline
structure. Existing state-of-the-art models typically rely on computationally
expensive, iterative flow-matching approaches. We propose a novel loss function
that correctly captures key geometric molecular properties while maintaining
permutation invariance over $\mathcal{S}$. We achieve this via a differentiable
linear assignment scheme based on the Sinkhorn algorithm. Remarkably, we show
that even a simple regression using our method {\em SinkFast} significantly
outperforms more complex flow-matching approaches on the COD-Cluster17
benchmark, a curated subset of the Crystallography Open Database (COD).

*Woon Yee Ng,Li Rong Wang,Siyuan Liu,Xiuyi Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Causal SHAP, an enhanced model interpretability framework that incorporates causality into feature attribution, addressing SHAP's inefficiency in distinguishing causality from correlation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing deployment of ML models in critical domains like healthcare necessitates accurate interpretability methods, but existing tools like SHAP are limited because they fail to separate causal effects from mere correlations.

Method: Causal SHAP is developed by integrating the Peter-Clark (PC) algorithm for causal discovery and the IDA algorithm for quantifying causal strength, enabling accurate feature attribution by reducing scores for non-causal features.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real data validated that Causal SHAP effectively addresses shortcomings of SHAP by minimizing the importance of features correlated but not causally linked to a target.

Conclusion: Causal SHAP offers a practical, causality-aware framework for model explanations, significantly benefiting domains like healthcare where understanding causal relationships is critical for precise decision-making.

Abstract: Explaining machine learning (ML) predictions has become crucial as ML models
are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains such as healthcare. While
SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is widely used for model interpretability,
it fails to differentiate between causality and correlation, often
misattributing feature importance when features are highly correlated. We
propose Causal SHAP, a novel framework that integrates causal relationships
into feature attribution while preserving many desirable properties of SHAP. By
combining the Peter-Clark (PC) algorithm for causal discovery and the
Intervention Calculus when the DAG is Absent (IDA) algorithm for causal
strength quantification, our approach addresses the weakness of SHAP.
Specifically, Causal SHAP reduces attribution scores for features that are
merely correlated with the target, as validated through experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets. This study contributes to the field of
Explainable AI (XAI) by providing a practical framework for causal-aware model
explanations. Our approach is particularly valuable in domains such as
healthcare, where understanding true causal relationships is critical for
informed decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional talent identification methods are manual, focused mainly on academics, and delay interventions, missing non-academic talents and early opportunities to support students.

Method: The researchers developed TalentPredictor, a semi-supervised multi-modal neural network combining Transformer, LSTM, and ANN, analyzing award records and educational data to predict seven talent types from secondary school students.

Result: The TalentPredictor model demonstrated high prediction performance with 0.908 classification accuracy and 0.908 ROCAUC, using data from 1,041 secondary school students.

Conclusion: TalentPredictor shows the capability of AI to transform talent identification, allowing early recognition of diverse skills and fostering student development through timely interventions.

Abstract: Talent identification plays a critical role in promoting student development.
However, traditional approaches often rely on manual processes or focus
narrowly on academic achievement, and typically delaying intervention until the
higher education stage. This oversight overlooks diverse non-academic talents
and misses opportunities for early intervention. To address this gap, this
study introduces TalentPredictor, a novel semi-supervised multi-modal neural
network that combines Transformer, LSTM, and ANN architectures. This model is
designed to predict seven different talent types--academic, sport, art,
leadership, service, technology, and others--in secondary school students
within an offline educational setting. Drawing on existing offline educational
data from 1,041 local secondary students, TalentPredictor overcomes the
limitations of traditional talent identification methods. By clustering various
award records into talent categories and extracting features from students'
diverse learning behaviors, it achieves high prediction accuracy (0.908
classification accuracy, 0.908 ROCAUC). This demonstrates the potential of
machine learning to identify diverse talents early in student development.

effect of the temperature $\tau$ and derive a theoretical bound between the
Gumbel-softmax distribution and our proposed approximated distribution. We
perform experiments on several large-scale credit lending and other tabular
datasets, assessing their performance in terms of the quantitative measures of
interpretability, diversity, instability, and validity. These results indicate
that our approach outperforms popular baseline methods, producing robust and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve explainability in machine learning models by addressing the limitations of existing counterfactual explanation methods, particularly in reducing overfitting and ensuring the generated explanations are in-distribution.

Method: The authors use a Gaussian process to design an autoencoder architecture, introduce a new density estimator for in-distribution sample generation, and develop an algorithm to optimize the regularization rate in the density estimation process.

Result: The proposed method was tested on several large-scale tabular datasets and found to produce diversified, in-distribution counterfactual explanations, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates that their approach improves the generation of reliable and diverse counterfactual samples while maintaining simplicity in model complexity.

Abstract: Explainable machine learning has attracted much interest in the community
where the stakes are high. Counterfactual explanations methods have become an
important tool in explaining a black-box model. The recent advances have
leveraged the power of generative models such as an autoencoder. In this paper,
we propose a novel method using a Gaussian process to construct the
auto-encoder architecture for generating counterfactual samples. The resulting
model requires fewer learnable parameters and thus is less prone to
overfitting. We also introduce a novel density estimator that allows for
searching for in-distribution samples. Furthermore, we introduce an algorithm
for selecting the optimal regularization rate on density estimator while
searching for counterfactuals. We experiment with our method in several
large-scale tabular datasets and compare with other auto-encoder-based methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DTRNet introduces a modified Transformer architecture that reduces computational costs by applying lightweight, linear updates to tokens while dynamically skipping expensive quadratic self-attention for most tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of quadratic self-attention in standard Transformers, which is computationally expensive, especially for long-context inputs.

Method: DTRNet achieves efficiency by dynamically routing only a small number (~10%) of tokens through full quadratic self-attention at each layer, while applying linear updates to the rest of the tokens. This retains token updates while lowering overall computational costs.

Result: DTRNet matches the performance of traditional Transformers, outperforms other routing-based methods like MoD and D-LLM, and significantly reduces computational costs and memory requirements, particularly for long sequences.

Conclusion: DTRNet offers a computation-efficient and scalable alternative to traditional Transformers by dynamically decoupling token updates from costly attention calculations without compromising accuracy or performance.

Abstract: Transformers achieve state-of-the-art results across many tasks, but their
uniform application of quadratic self-attention to every token at every layer
makes them computationally expensive. We introduce DTRNet (Dynamic Token
Routing Network), an improved Transformer architecture that allows tokens to
dynamically skip the quadratic cost of cross-token mixing while still receiving
lightweight linear updates. By preserving the MLP module and reducing the
attention cost for most tokens to linear, DTRNet ensures that every token is
explicitly updated while significantly lowering overall computation. This
design offers an efficient and effective alternative to standard dense
attention. Once trained, DTRNet blocks routes only ~10% of tokens through
attention at each layer while maintaining performance comparable to a full
Transformer. It consistently outperforms routing-based layer skipping methods
such as MoD and D-LLM in both accuracy and memory at matched FLOPs, while
routing fewer tokens to full attention. Its efficiency gains, scales with
sequence length, offering significant reduction in FLOPs for long-context
inputs. By decoupling token updates from attention mixing, DTRNet substantially
reduces the quadratic share of computation, providing a simple, efficient, and
scalable alternative to Transformers.

TL;DR: The paper studies feature sharing in graph neural networks (GNNs), linking representational geometry to model design choices for improved interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interpreting GNNs is challenging due to mixed signals and misalignment of internal channels with human concepts.

Method: Controlled experiments with graph concepts were used to extract features, analyze latent space geometry, and assess the impact of design choices like width and pooling.

Result: Findings include phase patterns with increased width, topology effects on node-level features, pooling’s impact on feature alignment, and metastable low-rank embeddings in shallow models.

Conclusion: GNN representational geometry is influenced by design parameters; practical suggestions are made for interpretable model design.

Abstract: Interpreting graph neural networks (GNNs) is difficult because message
passing mixes signals and internal channels rarely align with human concepts.
We study superposition, the sharing of directions by multiple features,
directly in the latent space of GNNs. Using controlled experiments with
unambiguous graph concepts, we extract features as (i) class-conditional
centroids at the graph level and (ii) linear-probe directions at the node
level, and then analyze their geometry with simple basis-invariant diagnostics.
Across GCN/GIN/GAT we find: increasing width produces a phase pattern in
overlap; topology imprints overlap onto node-level features that pooling
partially remixes into task-aligned graph axes; sharper pooling increases axis
alignment and reduces channel sharing; and shallow models can settle into
metastable low-rank embeddings. These results connect representational geometry
with concrete design choices (width, pooling, and final-layer activations) and
suggest practical approaches for more interpretable GNNs.

*Aref Jafari,Yuhe Fan,Benyamin Jamialahmadi,Parsa Farinneya,Boxing Chen,Marzieh S. Tahaei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SCOUT is a hybrid Transformer architecture aimed at efficiently handling long sequences by compressing and selectively attending to token representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the quadratic attention complexity of Transformers, which limits scalability to long sequences, while improving upon linear models' inability to retain detailed information from distant tokens.

Method: SCOUT combines linear mixers for local token integration and sparse attention on compressed checkpoint tokens summarizing the input history, enabling efficient performance on long sequence tasks.

Result: SCOUT outperforms competitive baseline models under similar computational budgets, achieves comparable results to full-attention Transformers, and improves throughput on long-sequence benchmarks.

Conclusion: SCOUT strikes a balance between scalability and performance, effectively handling long-sequence tasks with sub-quadratic memory growth and efficient computational design.

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of
sequence modeling tasks, but their quadratic attention complexity limits
scalability to long sequences. Linear models such as Mamba and sliding-window
attention (SWA) address this by mixing tokens through recurrent or localized
operations with fixed-size memory, achieving efficient inference. However,
these methods risk degrading performance on long sequences due to their
inability to retain detailed information from distant tokens. We propose SCOUT
(Segment Compression for Optimized Utility in Transformers), a hybrid
architecture that compresses tokens locally within fixed-size segments and
applies attention only over these compressed representations. Each token
embedding is first enriched via a linear local mixer, Mamba or SWA, that
integrates recent context. Then, instead of attending to all previous tokens,
each token sparsely attends to a small number of compressed checkpoint tokens
that summarize the input history. This design retains much of the expressivity
of full attention while substantially reducing the computational and memory
cost. By attending to compressed history rather than all previous tokens, SCOUT
incurs slightly higher memory than purely linear models, but its growth rate
remains sub-quadratic and far more scalable than that of full Transformers. We
analyze SCOUT's computational and memory efficiency and evaluate it empirically
on long-context language modeling and reasoning tasks. SCOUT with both Mamba
and SWA mixers outperforms strong long-sequence baselines under the same
computational budget, matches full-attention Transformers on language modeling

*Olusola Odeyomi,Sofiat Olaosebikan,Ajibuwa Opeyemi,Oluwadoyinsola Ige*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenges of high data heterogeneity, time-varying data distributions, and Byzantine resilience in online decentralized federated learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend multi-task learning to online decentralized federated learning in real-world scenarios with challenges like data heterogeneity and Byzantine clients.

Method: Develop an algorithm utilizing cyber-physical properties to assign trust probabilities to peer-to-peer client communications.

Result: Simulation results show the algorithm achieves performance close to ideal scenarios without Byzantine clients.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully combines model personalization with Byzantine resilience in challenging online decentralized federated environments.

Abstract: Multi-task learning is an effective way to address the challenge of model
personalization caused by high data heterogeneity in federated learning.
However, extending multi-task learning to the online decentralized federated
learning setting is yet to be explored. The online decentralized federated
learning setting considers many real-world applications of federated learning,
such as autonomous systems, where clients communicate peer-to-peer and the data
distribution of each client is time-varying. A more serious problem in
real-world applications of federated learning is the presence of Byzantine
clients. Byzantine-resilient approaches used in federated learning work only
when the number of Byzantine clients is less than one-half the total number of
clients. Yet, it is difficult to put a limit on the number of Byzantine clients
within a system in reality. However, recent work in robotics shows that it is
possible to exploit cyber-physical properties of a system to predict clients'
behavior and assign a trust probability to received signals. This can help to
achieve resiliency in the presence of a dominating number of Byzantine clients.
Therefore, in this paper, we develop an online decentralized federated
multi-task learning algorithm to provide model personalization and resiliency
when the number of Byzantine clients dominates the number of honest clients.
Our proposed algorithm leverages cyber-physical properties, such as the
received signal strength in wireless systems or side information, to assign a
trust probability to local models received from neighbors in each iteration.
Our simulation results show that the proposed algorithm performs close to a
Byzantine-free setting.

*Runjia Zeng,Guangyan Sun,Qifan Wang,Tong Geng,Sohail Dianat,Xiaotian Han,Raghuveer Rao,Xueling Zhang,Cheng Han,Lifu Huang,Dongfang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Mixture of Expert Prompt Tuning (MEPT), leveraging a Mixture of Experts architecture to enhance fine-tuning by activating adaptive neural pathways for diverse data distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fine-tuning methods for neural networks struggle to adapt dynamically to diverse and evolving data distributions due to rigid parameter spaces.

Method: MEPT integrates prompt experts into a Mixture of Experts framework, allowing dynamic adaptation to data distributions. Theoretical insights and pathway visualizations support its efficacy.

Result: MEPT achieves a 1.94% improvement in mean accuracy on SuperGLUE and reduces activated prompts by 79.25%, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: MEPT is effective and efficient as a manifold-mapping framework, pushing forward the frontier of parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods for neural networks.

Abstract: Considering deep neural networks as manifold mappers, the
pretrain-then-fine-tune paradigm can be interpreted as a two-stage process:
pretrain establishes a broad knowledge base, and fine-tune adjusts the model
parameters to activate specific neural pathways to align with the target
manifold. Although prior fine-tuning approaches demonstrate success, their
rigid parameter space limits their ability to dynamically activate appropriate
neural pathways, rendering them ill-equipped to adapt flexibly to the diverse
and evolving data distributions. In light of this view, we propose a novel
approach, Mixture of Expert Prompt Tuning (MEPT), as an effective and efficient
manifold-mapping framework. MEPT leverages the Mixture of Experts architecture
by integrating multiple prompt experts to adaptively learn diverse and
non-stationary data distributions. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that MEPT
outperforms several state-of-the-art parameter efficient baselines on
SuperGLUE, achieving notable improvements in mean accuracy (e.g., 1.94%) while
significantly reducing activated prompts by 79.25%. The effectiveness of MEPT
is further supported by theoretical insights from manifold learning and
validated through neural activation pathway visualization results. Our code is
avaliable at https://github.com/runtsang/MEPT.

### [576] [Any-Order Flexible Length Masked Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01025)
*Jaeyeon Kim,Lee Cheuk-Kit,Carles Domingo-Enrich,Yilun Du,Sham Kakade,Timothy Ngotiaoco,Sitan Chen,Michael Albergo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents Flexible Masked Diffusion Models (FlexMDMs), an enhancement to MDMs enabling sequence generation with flexible lengths while maintaining parallel, any-order inference capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitation of traditional Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) that can only handle fixed-length sequence generation, which restricts their application in various domains.

Method: The authors create FlexMDMs based on an extended stochastic interpolant framework, allowing the models to insert and unmask tokens to generate sequences of flexible lengths. They also describe an approach to retrofit pretrained MDMs to FlexMDMs with fine-tuning.

Result: FlexMDMs match the performance of MDMs in perplexity, better model length statistics, and demonstrate a 60% higher success rate on a synthetic maze planning task. Fine-tuned models also show performance improvement in math and code tasks.

Conclusion: FlexMDMs extend the capabilities of MDMs by incorporating support for flexible-length sequence generation without sacrificing performance or inference speed, making them more versatile for practical applications.

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to autoregressive models over discrete domains. MDMs generate
sequences in an any-order, parallel fashion, enabling fast inference and strong
performance on non-causal tasks. However, a crucial limitation is that they do
not support token insertions and are thus limited to fixed-length generations.
To this end, we introduce Flexible Masked Diffusion Models (FlexMDMs), a
discrete diffusion paradigm that simultaneously can model sequences of flexible
length while provably retaining MDMs' flexibility of any-order inference.
Grounded in an extension of the stochastic interpolant framework, FlexMDMs
generate sequences by inserting mask tokens and unmasking them. Empirically, we
show that FlexMDMs match MDMs in perplexity while modeling length statistics
with much higher fidelity. On a synthetic maze planning task, they achieve
$\approx 60 \%$ higher success rate than MDM baselines. Finally, we show
pretrained MDMs can easily be retrofitted into FlexMDMs: on 16 H100s, it takes
only three days to fine-tune LLaDA-8B into a FlexMDM, achieving superior
performance on math (GSM8K, $58\% \to 67\%$) and code infilling performance
($52\% \to 65\%$).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces TPRL-DG, a reinforcement learning framework for Human Activity Recognition (HAR) to address challenges of cross-user variability and enhance generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HAR methods face issues of overfitting due to cross-user variability. Improving generalization while maintaining accuracy is essential for scalable applications like healthcare and fitness tracking.

Method: TPRL-DG framework uses reinforcement learning with a Transformer-based autoregressive generator to produce user-invariant temporal tokens optimized through multi-objective reward functions.

Result: Evaluations on DSADS and PAMAP2 datasets demonstrate that TPRL-DG outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing higher cross-user accuracy and eliminating per-user calibration.

Conclusion: TPRL-DG offers scalable solutions for HAR systems by effectively capturing user-invariant temporal patterns, thereby advancing applications in healthcare, fitness, and smart environments.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using wearable sensors is crucial for
healthcare, fitness tracking, and smart environments, yet cross-user
variability -- stemming from diverse motion patterns, sensor placements, and
physiological traits -- hampers generalization in real-world settings.
Conventional supervised learning methods often overfit to user-specific
patterns, leading to poor performance on unseen users. Existing domain
generalization approaches, while promising, frequently overlook temporal
dependencies or depend on impractical domain-specific labels. We propose
Temporal-Preserving Reinforcement Learning Domain Generalization (TPRL-DG), a
novel framework that redefines feature extraction as a sequential
decision-making process driven by reinforcement learning. TPRL-DG leverages a
Transformer-based autoregressive generator to produce temporal tokens that
capture user-invariant activity dynamics, optimized via a multi-objective
reward function balancing class discrimination and cross-user invariance. Key
innovations include: (1) an RL-driven approach for domain generalization, (2)
autoregressive tokenization to preserve temporal coherence, and (3) a
label-free reward design eliminating the need for target user annotations.
Evaluations on the DSADS and PAMAP2 datasets show that TPRL-DG surpasses
state-of-the-art methods in cross-user generalization, achieving superior
accuracy without per-user calibration. By learning robust, user-invariant
temporal patterns, TPRL-DG enables scalable HAR systems, facilitating
advancements in personalized healthcare, adaptive fitness tracking, and
context-aware environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in capturing the structural complexity of material synthesis procedures in existing data-driven approaches.

Method: Adopted PROV-DM for graph-based modeling and used large language models to extract synthesis procedures into the MatPROV dataset.

Result: MatPROV captures materials' synthesis complexities and causal relationships, presenting them as machine-interpretable directed graphs.

Conclusion: The representation in MatPROV facilitates further research in automated synthesis planning and optimization, leveraging structural and causal insights.

Abstract: Synthesis procedures play a critical role in materials research, as they
directly affect material properties. With data-driven approaches increasingly
accelerating materials discovery, there is growing interest in extracting
synthesis procedures from scientific literature as structured data. However,
existing studies often rely on rigid, domain-specific schemas with predefined
fields for structuring synthesis procedures or assume that synthesis procedures
are linear sequences of operations, which limits their ability to capture the
structural complexity of real-world procedures. To address these limitations,
we adopt PROV-DM, an international standard for provenance information, which
supports flexible, graph-based modeling of procedures. We present MatPROV, a
dataset of PROV-DM-compliant synthesis procedures extracted from scientific
literature using large language models. MatPROV captures structural
complexities and causal relationships among materials, operations, and
conditions through visually intuitive directed graphs. This representation
enables machine-interpretable synthesis knowledge, opening opportunities for
future research such as automated synthesis planning and optimization.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SC-GIR, a goal-oriented semantic communication framework for image transmission, overcoming challenges in task-agnostic and efficient data sharing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current goal-oriented semantic communication systems struggle with redundant data exchange and dependency on labeled datasets, limiting task-agnostic functionality.

Method: The SC-GIR leverages self-supervised learning with covariance-based contrastive techniques to create invariant latent representations, reducing communication overhead while retaining task-critical features.

Result: SC-GIR achieved nearly 10% improvement over baseline methods and classification accuracy of over 85% for compressed data across various SNR conditions in extensive experiments.

Conclusion: SC-GIR effectively addresses challenges in goal-oriented semantic communication by offering compact, meaningful, and task-agnostic representations for efficient machine-to-machine communication tasks.

Abstract: Goal-oriented semantic communication (SC) aims to revolutionize communication
systems by transmitting only task-essential information. However, current
approaches face challenges such as joint training at transceivers, leading to
redundant data exchange and reliance on labeled datasets, which limits their
task-agnostic utility. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
framework called Goal-oriented Invariant Representation-based SC (SC-GIR) for
image transmission. Our framework leverages self-supervised learning to extract
an invariant representation that encapsulates crucial information from the
source data, independent of the specific downstream task. This compressed
representation facilitates efficient communication while retaining key features
for successful downstream task execution. Focusing on machine-to-machine tasks,
we utilize covariance-based contrastive learning techniques to obtain a latent
representation that is both meaningful and semantically dense. To evaluate the
effectiveness of the proposed scheme on downstream tasks, we apply it to
various image datasets for lossy compression. The compressed representations
are then used in a goal-oriented AI task. Extensive experiments on several
datasets demonstrate that SC-GIR outperforms baseline schemes by nearly 10%,,
and achieves over 85% classification accuracy for compressed data under
different SNR conditions. These results underscore the effectiveness of the
proposed framework in learning compact and informative latent representations.

*Guangli Li,Canbiao Wu,Zhehao Zhou,Na Tian,Zhen Liang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Multi-domain Aggregation Transfer Learning framework (MATL-DC) for EEG-based emotion recognition, addressing challenges in domain dependency by using a novel prototype-based approach for unseen targets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge in EEG-based emotion recognition systems where current transfer learning models heavily rely on both source and target domain data, limiting their practical application to unseen targets.

Method: The proposed MATL-DC framework decouples domain-specific and class-specific features to form a superdomain with a multi-domain aggregation mechanism. It employs class prototype representations and pairwise learning strategies to reduce label noise and increase efficiency in emotion recognition across unseen domains.

Result: Rigorous validation on publicly available EEG datasets (SEED, SEED-IV, SEED-V) showed accuracy rates of 84.70%, 68.11%, and 61.08%, respectively. MATL-DC performed comparable or better than models using both source and target domain data.

Conclusion: The MATL-DC framework overcomes the limitations of domain dependency in EEG emotion recognition, performing effectively for unseen targets and advancing application potentials in affective Brain-Computer Interfaces.

Abstract: Emotion recognition based on electroencephalography (EEG) signals is
increasingly becoming a key research hotspot in affective Brain-Computer
Interfaces (aBCIs). However, the current transfer learning model greatly
depends on the source domain and target domain data, which hinder the practical
application of emotion recognition. Therefore, we propose a Multi-domain
Aggregation Transfer Learning framework for EEG emotion recognition with
Domain-Class prototype under unseen targets (MATL-DC). We design the feature
decoupling module to decouple class-invariant domain features from
domain-invariant class features from shallow features. In the model training
stage, the multi-domain aggregation mechanism aggregates the domain feature
space to form a superdomain, which enhances the characteristics of emotional
EEG signals. In each superdomain, we further extract the class prototype
representation by class features. In addition, we adopt the pairwise learning
strategy to transform the sample classification problem into the similarity
problem between sample pairs, which effectively alleviates the influence of
label noise. It is worth noting that the target domain is completely unseen
during the training process. In the inference stage, we use the trained
domain-class prototypes for inference, and then realize emotion recognition. We
rigorously validate it on the publicly available databases (SEED, SEED-IV and
SEED-V). The results show that the accuracy of MATL-DC model is 84.70\%,
68.11\% and 61.08\%, respectively. MATL-DC achieves comparable or even better
performance than methods that rely on both source and target domains. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to simplify and improve distributed trajectory optimization for multi-agent systems by overcoming inefficiencies in hyperparameter tuning.

Method: The proposed method, L2C, employs agent-wise neural networks for hyperparameter meta-learning, includes distributed differentiation through ADMM-DDP, and utilizes efficient meta-gradient computation via Riccati recursions and feedback gains.

Result: L2C achieves dynamically feasible trajectories in simulations and adapts to diverse team sizes and conditions, delivering up to 88% faster gradient computation compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The framework enables rapid and robust coordination in multi-agent tasks, presenting significant computational improvements and practical applicability in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Distributed trajectory optimization via ADMM-DDP is a powerful approach for
coordinating multi-agent systems, but it requires extensive tuning of tightly
coupled hyperparameters that jointly govern local task performance and global
coordination. In this paper, we propose Learning to Coordinate (L2C), a general
framework that meta-learns these hyperparameters, modeled by lightweight
agent-wise neural networks, to adapt across diverse tasks and agent
configurations. L2C differentiates end-to-end through the ADMM-DDP pipeline in
a distributed manner. It also enables efficient meta-gradient computation by
reusing DDP components such as Riccati recursions and feedback gains. These
gradients correspond to the optimal solutions of distributed matrix-valued LQR
problems, coordinated across agents via an auxiliary ADMM framework that
becomes convex under mild assumptions. Training is further accelerated by
truncating iterations and meta-learning ADMM penalty parameters optimized for
rapid residual reduction, with provable Lipschitz-bounded gradient errors. On a
challenging cooperative aerial transport task, L2C generates dynamically
feasible trajectories in high-fidelity simulation using IsaacSIM, reconfigures
quadrotor formations for safe 6-DoF load manipulation in tight spaces, and
adapts robustly to varying team sizes and task conditions, while achieving up
to $88\%$ faster gradient computation than state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations in xLSTM when modeling real-world temporal data with unknown and complex dynamics.

Method: StoxLSTM incorporates stochastic latent variables and recurrent blocks into xLSTM, transforming it into a state-space modeling framework.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets indicate StoxLSTM surpasses state-of-the-art alternatives in robustness and generalization.

Conclusion: StoxLSTM offers improved representational and forecasting capacity, making it a reliable approach for complex time series applications.

Abstract: The Extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) network has attracted widespread
research interest due to its enhanced capability to model complex temporal
dependencies in diverse time series applications. Despite its success, there is
still potential to further improve its representational capacity and
forecasting performance, particularly on challenging real-world datasets with
unknown, intricate, and hierarchical dynamics. In this work, we propose a
stochastic xLSTM, termed StoxLSTM, that improves the original architecture into
a state space modeling framework by incorporating stochastic latent variables
within xLSTM. StoxLSTM models the latent dynamic evolution through specially
designed recurrent blocks, enabling it to effectively capture the underlying
temporal patterns and dependencies. Extensive experiments on publicly available
benchmark datasets from multiple research communities demonstrate that StoxLSTM
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with better robustness and

TL;DR: The paper introduces Relationship Preserving Loss (RPL), a loss function aimed at maintaining important vector space properties during dimensionality reduction, ensuring embedded data integrity for tasks such as retrieval and clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dimensionality reduction often distorts critical vector space properties such as orthogonality and linear independence, impacting tasks like cross-modal retrieval, clustering, and classification.

Method: The proposed RPL minimizes discrepancies between relationship matrices of high-dimensional data and their low-dimensional embeddings, leveraging neural networks and matrix perturbation theory to support error bounds.

Result: Experiments show that RPL allows dimensionality reduction while largely retaining performance on downstream tasks by preserving essential vector space properties.

Conclusion: RPL enables robust dimensionality reduction and has broader applications in areas such as knowledge distillation, cross-domain alignment, fairness, graph learning, and federated learning.

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction can distort vector space properties such as
orthogonality and linear independence, which are critical for tasks including
cross-modal retrieval, clustering, and classification. We propose a
Relationship Preserving Loss (RPL), a loss function that preserves these
properties by minimizing discrepancies between relationship matrices (e.g.,
Gram or cosine) of high-dimensional data and their low-dimensional embeddings.
RPL trains neural networks for non-linear projections and is supported by error
bounds derived from matrix perturbation theory. Initial experiments suggest
that RPL reduces embedding dimensions while largely retaining performance on
downstream tasks, likely due to its preservation of key vector space
properties. While we describe here the use of RPL in dimensionality reduction,
this loss can also be applied more broadly, for example to cross-domain
alignment and transfer learning, knowledge distillation, fairness and
invariance, dehubbing, graph and manifold learning, and federated learning,
where distributed embeddings must remain geometrically consistent.

Motivation: Balancing training accuracy and adversarial robustness has been a persistent challenge in deep learning.

Method: The authors propose a geometry-aware framework with layer-wise local training to sculpt internal representations and utilize an energy model with Hebbian coupling.

Result: The framework enhances adversarial robustness (against white or black box attacks) and smooths feature manifolds in deep networks.

Conclusion: This work aligns concepts of biological and artificial intelligence, enabling deep networks to integrate new information while reducing interference in representations.

Abstract: How to balance training accuracy and adversarial robustness has become a
challenge since the birth of deep learning. Here, we introduce a geometry-aware
deep learning framework that leverages layer-wise local training to sculpt the
internal representations of deep neural networks. This framework promotes
intra-class compactness and inter-class separation in feature space, leading to
manifold smoothness and adversarial robustness against white or black box
attacks. The performance can be explained by an energy model with Hebbian
coupling between elements of the hidden representation. Our results thus shed
light on the physics of learning in the direction of alignment between
biological and artificial intelligence systems. Using the current framework,
the deep network can assimilate new information into existing knowledge
structures while reducing representation interference.

TL;DR: The paper critiques the focus on expressivity theory for graph neural networks (GNNs) and introduces Message Passing Complexity (MPC) as a better framework for understanding their performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current focus on expressivity theory for GNNs is insufficient for explaining their performance in real-world tasks, as it relies on binary characterizations and ignores practical limitations.

Method: The authors propose Message Passing Complexity (MPC), a continuous measure reflecting GNNs' practical capabilities, including issues like over-squashing. It incorporates theoretical aspects of expressivity while better correlating with empirical results.

Result: Extensive validation shows that MPC's theoretical predictions align with real-world performance, providing insights into the success and failure of GNN architectures.

Conclusion: MPC bridges theory and practice more effectively than expressivity theory, offering a robust framework for analyzing and improving GNN architectures.

Abstract: Expressivity theory, characterizing which graphs a GNN can distinguish, has
become the predominant framework for analyzing GNNs, with new models striving
for higher expressivity. However, we argue that this focus is misguided: First,
higher expressivity is not necessary for most real-world tasks as these tasks
rarely require expressivity beyond the basic WL test. Second, expressivity
theory's binary characterization and idealized assumptions fail to reflect
GNNs' practical capabilities. To overcome these limitations, we propose Message
Passing Complexity (MPC): a continuous measure that quantifies the difficulty
for a GNN architecture to solve a given task through message passing. MPC
captures practical limitations like over-squashing while preserving the
theoretical impossibility results from expressivity theory, effectively
narrowing the gap between theory and practice. Through extensive validation on
fundamental GNN tasks, we show that MPC's theoretical predictions correlate
with empirical performance, successfully explaining architectural successes and
failures. Thereby, MPC advances beyond expressivity theory to provide a more
powerful and nuanced framework for understanding and improving GNN
architectures.

*Andrea Fox,Francesco De Pellegrini,Eitan Altman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a decentralized framework for multi-agent systems using constrained Markov decision processes to enable lightweight coordination while ensuring system-wide objectives are met.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge computing systems require fast local decisions from autonomous agents that often have to compete for shared resources. Existing multi-agent reinforcement learning approaches struggle under conditions of limited observability and communication.

Method: The authors propose a framework where each agent solves a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) with a shared constraint vector that is updated infrequently. Safe reinforcement learning helps agents balance local and global resource objectives under minimal direct communication.

Result: Theoretical guarantees were established, and experimental validation demonstrated improved performance of the proposed framework over centralized and independent baselines, particularly in large-scale scenarios.

Conclusion: The decentralized method aligns individual and global goals effectively with lightweight coordination, presenting an advance in scalability and efficiency for edge computing systems.

Abstract: In edge computing systems, autonomous agents must make fast local decisions
while competing for shared resources. Existing MARL methods often resume to
centralized critics or frequent communication, which fail under limited
observability and communication constraints. We propose a decentralized
framework in which each agent solves a constrained Markov decision process
(CMDP), coordinating implicitly through a shared constraint vector. For the
specific case of offloading, e.g., constraints prevent overloading shared
server resources. Coordination constraints are updated infrequently and act as
a lightweight coordination mechanism. They enable agents to align with global
resource usage objectives but require little direct communication. Using safe
reinforcement learning, agents learn policies that meet both local and global
goals. We establish theoretical guarantees under mild assumptions and validate
our approach experimentally, showing improved performance over centralized and

*Stefano Fioravanti,Matteo Zavatteri,Roberto Confalonieri,Kamyar Zeinalipour,Paolo Frazzetto,Alessandro Sperduti,Nicolò Navarin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduces an in-context learning strategy to enhance generalization in LLMs for reasoning tasks, especially algebraic expressions with non-standard rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with systematic generalization and handling out-of-distribution examples, especially in reasoning tasks with compositional rules.

Method: The authors propose an iterative example selection strategy that incrementally selects tailored few-shot examples to improve task performance.

Result: LLMs demonstrate limited proficiency in mathematical tasks but improve when using the iterative selection strategy combined with reasoning instructions.

Conclusion: Simpler few-shot examples aligned with reasoning instructions lead to better generalization in LLMs for challenging reasoning tasks compared to complex examples.

Abstract: LLMs face significant challenges in systematic generalization, particularly
when dealing with reasoning tasks requiring compositional rules and handling
out-of-distribution examples. To address these challenges, we introduce an
in-context learning methodology that improves the generalization capabilities
of general purpose LLMs. Our approach employs an iterative example selection
strategy, which incrementally constructs a tailored set of few-shot examples
optimized to enhance model's performance on a given task. As a proof of
concept, we apply this methodology to the resolution of algebraic expressions
involving non-standard simplification rules, according to which the priority of
addition and multiplication is changed.
  Our findings indicate that LLMs exhibit limited proficiency in these
mathematical tasks. We further demonstrate that LLMs reasoning benefits from
our iterative shot selection prompting strategy integrated with explicit
reasoning instructions. Crucially, our experiments reveal that some LLMs
achieve better generalization performances when prompted with simpler few-shot
examples rather than complex ones following the test data distribution.

*Julen Cestero,Marco Quartulli,Marcello Restelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes using reinforcement learning policies to improve sampling efficiency in simulated deterministic environments, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to improve sample efficiency in computationally expensive simulations, especially in environments with wide state spaces where traditional sampling strategies fail.

Method: They use policies trained through Reinforcement Learning to generate a mixed dataset that includes samples from random, expert, and exploratory agents for building surrogate models.

Result: The mixed dataset approach outperforms other methods like Latin-Hypercube Sampling, Active Learning, and Kriging in terms of state space representation.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances the state-of-the-art in surrogate modeling, paving the way for its use in complex simulator-driven RL policy optimization.

Abstract: Sample efficiency in the face of computationally expensive simulations is a
common concern in surrogate modeling. Current strategies to minimize the number
of samples needed are not as effective in simulated environments with wide
state spaces. As a response to this challenge, we propose a novel method to
efficiently sample simulated deterministic environments by using policies
trained by Reinforcement Learning. We provide an extensive analysis of these
surrogate-building strategies with respect to Latin-Hypercube sampling or
Active Learning and Kriging, cross-validating performances with all sampled
datasets. The analysis shows that a mixed dataset that includes samples
acquired by random agents, expert agents, and agents trained to explore the
regions of maximum entropy of the state transition distribution provides the
best scores through all datasets, which is crucial for a meaningful state space
representation. We conclude that the proposed method improves the
state-of-the-art and clears the path to enable the application of
surrogate-aided Reinforcement Learning policy optimization strategies on
complex simulators.

*Xiao Xue,M. F. P. ten Eikelder,Tianyue Yang,Yiqing Li,Kan He,Shuo Wang,Peter V. Coveney*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the equivariant U-shaped neural operator (E-UNO), a novel neural network model for efficiently solving the Cahn-Hilliard equation in binary mixtures, achieving improved accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Numerical solvers for interfacial dynamics in phase separation are computationally expensive and inflexible, while current neural operator architectures fail to capture multiscale behavior and physical symmetries.

Method: E-UNO combines global spectral convolution, a multi-resolution U-shaped architecture, and translation equivariance regulation to align with the physical properties of the Cahn-Hilliard equation.

Result: E-UNO outperforms standard Fourier and U-shaped neural operators, particularly in modeling fine-scale, high-frequency structures. It generalizes better, requires less training data, and ensures physically consistent predictions.

Conclusion: E-UNO is an efficient and data-driven alternative to traditional numerical solvers for complex phase-field systems, achieving significant improvements in prediction quality while aligning with physical symmetries.

Abstract: Phase separation in binary mixtures, governed by the Cahn-Hilliard equation,
plays a central role in interfacial dynamics across materials science and soft
matter. While numerical solvers are accurate, they are often computationally
expensive and lack flexibility across varying initial conditions and
geometries. Neural operators provide a data-driven alternative by learning
solution operators between function spaces, but current architectures often
fail to capture multiscale behavior and neglect underlying physical symmetries.
Here we show that an equivariant U-shaped neural operator (E-UNO) can learn the
evolution of the phase-field variable from short histories of past dynamics,
achieving accurate predictions across space and time. The model combines global
spectral convolution with a multi-resolution U-shaped architecture and
regulates translation equivariance to align with the underlying physics. E-UNO
outperforms standard Fourier neural operator and U-shaped neural operator
baselines, particularly on fine-scale and high-frequency structures. By
encoding symmetry and scale hierarchy, the model generalizes better, requires
less training data, and yields physically consistent dynamics. This establishes
E-UNO as an efficient surrogate for complex phase-field systems.

### [593] [Towards Trustworthy Vital Sign Forecasting: Leveraging Uncertainty for Prediction Intervals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01319)
*Li Rong Wang,Thomas C. Henderson,Yew Soon Ong,Yih Yng Ng,Xiuyi Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the need for interpretable and trustworthy predictions in vital-sign forecasting by proposing two methods to derive calibrated prediction intervals (PIs) using a Reconstruction Uncertainty Estimate (RUE).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinicians need reliable and interpretable uncertainty measures to trust model outputs in vital-sign forecasting; without this, it is hard to distinguish meaningful warnings from noise.

Method: The authors propose two approaches for deriving PIs from RUE: (1) a parametric Gaussian copula-based method for closed-form PI computation and (2) a non-parametric KNN-based approach that empirically estimates conditional error distributions.

Result: The Gaussian copula method excels in low-frequency data scenarios, whereas the KNN approach performs better with high-frequency data. Both methods outperform conventional conformal prediction baselines in their respective domains of application.

Conclusion: The proposed RUE-derived PIs show potential to enhance clinical decision-making by providing interpretable and uncertainty-aware forecasts for vital signs.

Abstract: Vital signs, such as heart rate and blood pressure, are critical indicators
of patient health and are widely used in clinical monitoring and
decision-making. While deep learning models have shown promise in forecasting
these signals, their deployment in healthcare remains limited in part because
clinicians must be able to trust and interpret model outputs. Without reliable
uncertainty quantification -- particularly calibrated prediction intervals
(PIs) -- it is unclear whether a forecasted abnormality constitutes a
meaningful warning or merely reflects model noise, hindering clinical
decision-making. To address this, we present two methods for deriving PIs from
the Reconstruction Uncertainty Estimate (RUE), an uncertainty measure
well-suited to vital-sign forecasting due to its sensitivity to data shifts and
support for label-free calibration. Our parametric approach assumes that
prediction errors and uncertainty estimates follow a Gaussian copula
distribution, enabling closed-form PI computation. Our non-parametric approach,
based on k-nearest neighbours (KNN), empirically estimates the conditional
error distribution using similar validation instances. We evaluate these
methods on two large public datasets with minute- and hour-level sampling,
representing high- and low-frequency health signals. Experiments demonstrate
that the Gaussian copula method consistently outperforms conformal prediction
baselines on low-frequency data, while the KNN approach performs best on
high-frequency data. These results underscore the clinical promise of
RUE-derived PIs for delivering interpretable, uncertainty-aware vital sign
forecasts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents DEPO, a strategy to improve training efficiency for large reasoning models using optimized offline and online data selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high training costs and low data efficiency in scaling large reasoning models using reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards.

Method: The authors propose DEPO, combining offline data curation focusing on quality and diversity with online sample filtering using a sample-level explorability metric and a replay mechanism.

Result: DEPO outperformed existing methods across five benchmarks, achieving significant speed-ups (1.85x and 1.66x) using only 20% of the full training data.

Conclusion: DEPO demonstrated improved data efficiency and training speed while maintaining strong model performance, offering a solution to the cost challenges in training reasoning models.

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models have leveraged reinforcement
learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to improve reasoning capabilities.
However, scaling these methods typically requires extensive rollout computation
and large datasets, leading to high training costs and low data efficiency. To
mitigate this issue, we propose DEPO, a Data-Efficient Policy Optimization
pipeline that combines optimized strategies for both offline and online data
selection. In the offline phase, we curate a high-quality subset of training
samples based on diversity, influence, and appropriate difficulty. During
online RLVR training, we introduce a sample-level explorability metric to
dynamically filter samples with low exploration potential, thereby reducing
substantial rollout computational costs. Furthermore, we incorporate a replay
mechanism for under-explored samples to ensure adequate training, which
enhances the model's final convergence performance. Experiments across five
reasoning benchmarks show that DEPO consistently outperforms existing methods
in both offline and online data selection scenarios. Notably, using only 20% of
the training data, our approach achieves a 1.85 times speed-up on AIME24 and a
1.66 times speed-up on AIME25 compared to GRPO trained on the full dataset.

*Hong Lu,Jiali Chen,Jingzhao Zhang,Guannan He,Xuebing Han,Minggao Ouyang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Flexible Masked Autoencoder (FMAE) framework for scalable, intelligent battery management, enabling efficient multitask handling while reducing data and engineering requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Battery management systems require scalable and efficient methods due to the diverse tasks and data involved, which traditionally demand significant effort and resources.

Method: The authors developed FMAE, a pretraining framework that handles heterogeneous battery data and missing channels, providing adaptable representations for multiple tasks with minimal effort.

Result: FMAE showed superior performance across five battery management tasks and eleven datasets, requiring significantly less inference data while delivering state-of-the-art results. It also handles real-world data gaps effectively.

Conclusion: FMAE represents a practical approach to multi-task battery management, showcasing flexibility, data-efficiency, and reduced engineering efforts, making it suitable for industrial applications.

Abstract: Industrial-scale battery management involves various types of tasks, such as
estimation, prediction, and system-level diagnostics. Each task employs
distinct data across temporal scales, sensor resolutions, and data channels.
Building task-specific methods requires a great deal of data and engineering
effort, which limits the scalability of intelligent battery management. Here we
present the Flexible Masked Autoencoder (FMAE), a flexible pretraining
framework that can learn with missing battery data channels and capture
inter-correlations across data snippets. FMAE learns unified battery
representations from heterogeneous data and can be adopted by different tasks
with minimal data and engineering efforts. Experimentally, FMAE consistently
outperforms all task-specific methods across five battery management tasks with
eleven battery datasets. On remaining life prediction tasks, FMAE uses 50 times
less inference data while maintaining state-of-the-art results. Moreover, when
real-world data lack certain information, such as system voltage, FMAE can
still be applied with marginal performance impact, achieving comparable results
with the best hand-crafted features. FMAE demonstrates a practical route to a
flexible, data-efficient model that simplifies real-world multi-task management
of dynamical systems.

### [596] [Globally aware optimization with resurgence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01329)
*Wei Bu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents an optimization framework employing resurgence theory to improve global understanding of optimization landscapes, enabling better learning rate adaptation and escape from suboptimal regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Local gradient-based methods often fail to capture global information about the optimization landscape, resulting in suboptimal convergence and dependency on initialization.

Method: The framework utilizes resurgence theory and Borel transforms of factorially divergent series from parameter space partition functions to identify critical objective function values, which are then used to guide optimization.

Result: The approach provides a theoretically-grounded method for adapting learning rates and avoiding suboptimal regions by extracting critical information from the optimization landscape via asymptotic series analysis.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a principled and theoretically sound way to incorporate global landscape information into local optimization processes, addressing key limitations of traditional gradient-based methods.

Abstract: Modern optimization faces a fundamental challenge: local gradient-based
methods provide no global information about the objective function $L$
landscape, often leading to suboptimal convergence and sensitivity to
initialization. We introduce a novel optimization framework that leverages
resurgence theory from complex analysis to extract global structural
information from divergent asymptotic series. Our key insight is that the
factorially divergent perturbative expansions of parameter space partition
functions encode precise information about all critical objective function
value in the landscape through their Borel transform singularities.
  The algorithm works by computing the statistical mechanical partition
function $Z(g) = \int e^{-L(\theta)/g} d\theta$ for small coupling $g\ll 1$,
extracting its asymptotic series coefficients, and identifying Borel plane
singularities that correspond one-to-one with critical objective function
values. These target values provide global guidance to local optimizers,
enabling principled learning rate adaptation and escape from suboptimal
regions. Unlike heuristic adaptive methods, targets are theoretically grounded
in the geometry of the optimization landscape.

*Jaeho Choi,Hyeri Kim,Kwang-Ho Kim,Jaesung Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new Advanced Torrential (AT) loss function is developed to improve precipitation forecasting by addressing limitations of traditional metrics like CSI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional precipitation forecasting metrics like CSI are ineffective during extended dry periods, necessitating improved loss functions.

Method: Developed a penalty expression transformed into a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulation, which is then approximated into the proposed AT loss function.

Result: The AT loss function performs better in terms of forecast accuracy, demonstrated through Lipschitz constant analysis, performance evaluations, experiments, and ablation studies.

Conclusion: The AT loss function is a superior alternative for precipitation forecasting in machine learning models, addressing limitations of existing metrics.

Abstract: Accurate precipitation forecasting is becoming increasingly important in the
context of climate change. In response, machine learning-based approaches have
recently gained attention as an emerging alternative to traditional methods
such as numerical weather prediction and climate models. Nonetheless, many
recent approaches still rely on off-the-shelf loss functions, and even the more
advanced ones merely involve optimization processes based on the critical
success index (CSI). The problem, however, is that CSI may become ineffective
during extended dry periods when precipitation remains below the threshold,
rendering it less than ideal as a criterion for optimization. To address this
limitation, we introduce a simple penalty expression and reinterpret it as a
quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formulation. Ultimately, the
resulting QUBO formulation is relaxed into a differentiable advanced torrential
(AT) loss function through an approximation process. The proposed AT loss
demonstrates its superiority through the Lipschitz constant, forecast
performance evaluations, consistency experiments, and ablation studies with the
operational model.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel approach using Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAE) to identify and analyze causal impact for prediction tasks. It leverages interventional and counterfactual perspectives to pinpoint causally significant features and reduce confounding bias, showcasing its validity on spatiotemporal trajectory predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper lies in improving causal analysis and predictive accuracy by introducing a methodology to address the challenge of identifying causal impact efficiently and minimizing confounding biases in datasets.

Method: The method involves applying interventions to identify causally sensitive features and utilizing counterfactuals to evaluate the effect of changes. It adopts a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) as a generative model to achieve these objectives.

Result: The paper demonstrates effective causal impact identification and improved predictive performance, validated through experiments on the GeoLife dataset and the Asia Bayesian network.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully identifies causal impacts, reduces confounding biases, and enhances prediction accuracy in tasks like user trajectory prediction by integrating advanced generative modeling techniques.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel generative method to identify the causal
impact and apply it to prediction tasks. We conduct causal impact analysis
using interventional and counterfactual perspectives. First, applying
interventions, we identify features that have a causal influence on the
predicted outcome, which we refer to as causally sensitive features, and
second, applying counterfactuals, we evaluate how changes in the cause affect
the effect. Our method exploits the Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE)
to identify the causal impact and serve as a generative predictor. We are able
to reduce confounding bias by identifying causally sensitive features. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by recommending the most likely
locations a user will visit next in their spatiotemporal trajectory influenced
by the causal relationships among various features. Experiments on the
large-scale GeoLife [Zheng et al., 2010] dataset and the benchmark Asia
Bayesian network validate the ability of our method to identify causal impact
and improve predictive performance.

TL;DR: This paper introduces DPF-CM, a data processing framework for training and deploying Chinese medical language models, focusing on improved training data handling and privacy preservation measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the lack of emphasis on comprehensive training data processing in current open-source training pipelines for Chinese medical language models.

Method: The framework (DPF-CM) includes: (1) Enhanced data processing with chained examples context-learning and an ensemble-based filtering mechanism to improve data quality; (2) A Privacy Preserving Vector Database (PPVD) approach to secure data and minimize privacy leakage during deployment.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that DPF-CM enhances model accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art results among open-source Chinese medical LLMs. Additionally, it reduces training data privacy leakage by 27%.

Conclusion: The proposed framework not only optimizes model performance but also ensures better data privacy during deployment, addressing critical gaps in current open-source pipelines.

Abstract: Current open-source training pipelines for Chinese medical language models
predominantly emphasize optimizing training methodologies to enhance the
performance of large language models (LLMs), yet lack comprehensive exploration
into training data processing. To address this gap, we propose DPF-CM, a
holistic Data Processing Framework for Chinese Medical LLMs training and
deployment. DPF-CM comprises two core modules. The first module is a data
processing pipeline tailored for model training. Beyond standard data
processing operations, we (1) introduce a chained examples context-learning
strategy to generate question-oriented instructions to mitigate the lack of
instruction content, and (2) implement an ensemble-based filtering mechanism
for preference data curation that averages multiple reward models to suppress
noisy samples. The second module focuses on privacy preservation during model
deployment. To prevent privacy risks from the inadvertent exposure of training
data, we propose a Privacy Preserving Vector Database (PPVD) approach, which
involves model memory search, high-risk database construction, secure database
construction, and match-and-replace, four key stages to minimize privacy
leakage during inference collectively. Experimental results show that DPF-CM
significantly improves model accuracy, enabling our trained Chinese medical LLM
to achieve state-of-the-art performance among open-source counterparts.
Moreover, the framework reduces training data privacy leakage by 27%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to investigate ways to recover nanostructures from PDF data efficiently and accurately, addressing challenges in existing models for solving the nanostructure inverse problem.

Method: The authors present CbLDM, a latent diffusion model that incorporates conditional priors and replaces the distance matrix with the Laplacian matrix to improve sampling efficiency and reduce reconstruction error.

Result: CbLDM achieves significantly better prediction accuracy compared to existing models, showcasing its ability to handle the nanostructure inverse problem effectively.

Conclusion: CbLDM demonstrates high efficiency and accuracy in recovering nanostructures and has potential applications in other continuous conditional generation tasks.

Abstract: Nowadays, the nanostructure inverse problem is an attractive problem that
helps researchers to understand the relationship between the properties and the
structure of nanomaterials. This article focuses on the problem of using PDF to
recover the nanostructure, which this article views as a conditional generation
problem. This article propose a deep learning model CbLDM, Condition-based
Latent Diffusion Model. Based on the original latent diffusion model, the
sampling steps of the diffusion model are reduced and the sample generation
efficiency is improved by using the conditional prior to estimate conditional
posterior distribution, which is the approximated distribution of p(z|x). In
addition, this article uses the Laplacian matrix instead of the distance matrix
to recover the nanostructure, which can reduce the reconstruction error.
Finally, this article compares CbLDM with existing models which were used to
solve the nanostructure inverse problem, and find that CbLDM demonstrates
significantly higher prediction accuracy than these models, which reflects the
ability of CbLDM to solve the nanostructure inverse problem and the potential
to cope with other continuous conditional generation tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an adaptive random walk approach using hierarchical graph structures to capture long-range dependencies efficiently in graph prediction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Message-passing architectures are insufficient for modeling long-range dependencies in graph-related tasks, which limits their predictive capabilities on large graphs.

Method: The authors propose using learnable transition probabilities in adaptive random walks that choose between the original graph and hierarchical shortcuts for better long-range dependency modeling.

Result: On synthetic long-range tasks, the approach surpasses theoretical bounds of traditional methods and achieves comparable performance as longer walks on the original graph, using hierarchical shortcuts.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a promising direction for efficiently processing large graphs while effectively capturing long-range dependencies, improving graph-based predictive tasks.

Abstract: Message-passing architectures struggle to sufficiently model long-range
dependencies in node and graph prediction tasks. We propose a novel approach
exploiting hierarchical graph structures and adaptive random walks to address
this challenge. Our method introduces learnable transition probabilities that
decide whether the walk should prefer the original graph or travel across
hierarchical shortcuts. On a synthetic long-range task, we demonstrate that our
approach can exceed the theoretical bound that constrains traditional
approaches operating solely on the original topology. Specifically, walks that
prefer the hierarchy achieve the same performance as longer walks on the
original graph. These preliminary findings open a promising direction for
efficiently processing large graphs while effectively capturing long-range
dependencies.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the intractability of probabilistic inference in VQ-VAE models with large latent spaces by selectively distilling high-probability latent variables, preserving model capabilities while enabling tractable inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of intractable probabilistic inference in deep generative models with large discrete latent spaces, such as VQ-VAE.

Method: Distill the VQ-VAE model by selecting a subset of its latent variables with high probabilities, framing the distilled model as a probabilistic circuit to maintain expressiveness and tractability.

Result: The distilled probabilistic circuit model retains the expressiveness of VQ-VAE, allowing tractable probabilistic inference. Experiments show competitive results in density estimation and conditional generation tasks.

Conclusion: The study challenges the notion of VQ-VAE as inherently intractable by proposing an efficient distillation approach that enables tractable inference without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Deep generative models with discrete latent space, such as the
Vector-Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE), offer excellent data
generation capabilities, but, due to the large size of their latent space,
their probabilistic inference is deemed intractable. We demonstrate that the
VQ-VAE can be distilled into a tractable model by selecting a subset of latent
variables with high probabilities. This simple strategy is particularly
efficient, especially if the VQ-VAE underutilizes its latent space, which is,
indeed, very often the case. We frame the distilled model as a probabilistic
circuit, and show that it preserves expressiveness of the VQ-VAE while
providing tractable probabilistic inference. Experiments illustrate competitive
performance in density estimation and conditional generation tasks, challenging
the view of the VQ-VAE as an inherently intractable model.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the stability of model explanations for instance-dependent cost-sensitive (IDCS) classifiers in credit scoring, revealing a trade-off between cost-efficiency and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Increasing regulatory demands for transparency in credit scoring models necessitate an investigation into the stability of model explanations, particularly when using IDCS classifiers tailored for instance-specific costs.

Method: The study uses four public credit scoring datasets to assess IDCS classifiers' performance via a novel metric, then evaluates explanation stability for SHAP and LIME under varying class imbalances.

Result: IDCS classifiers achieve better cost-efficiency but produce less stable explanations, especially under high class imbalance, when compared to traditional models.

Conclusion: While IDCS classifiers enhance cost efficiency, their stability issues in explanations pose a significant challenge, emphasizing the need for solutions to ensure trustworthy interpretability amid regulatory requirements.

Abstract: Instance-dependent cost-sensitive (IDCS) classifiers offer a promising
approach to improving cost-efficiency in credit scoring by tailoring loss
functions to instance-specific costs. However, the impact of such loss
functions on the stability of model explanations remains unexplored in
literature, despite increasing regulatory demands for transparency. This study
addresses this gap by evaluating the stability of Local Interpretable
Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)
when applied to IDCS models. Using four publicly available credit scoring
datasets, we first assess the discriminatory power and cost-efficiency of IDCS
classifiers, introducing a novel metric to enhance cross-dataset comparability.
We then investigate the stability of SHAP and LIME feature importance rankings
under varying degrees of class imbalance through controlled resampling. Our
results reveal that while IDCS classifiers improve cost-efficiency, they
produce significantly less stable explanations compared to traditional models,
particularly as class imbalance increases, highlighting a critical trade-off
between cost optimization and interpretability in credit scoring. Amid
increasing regulatory scrutiny on explainability, this research underscores the
pressing need to address stability issues in IDCS classifiers to ensure that
their cost advantages are not undermined by unstable or untrustworthy
explanations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces MD-PNOP, a framework that utilizes neural operators to accelerate parametric PDE solvers while preserving physical constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reducing the computational overhead of traditional PDE solvers in large-scale parametric studies and design optimization.

Method: The MD-PNOP framework maps parameter deviation into a source term, allowing trained neural operators to generalize without retraining and embedding their predictions into PDE solvers as initial guesses.

Result: MD-PNOP achieves ~50% reduction in computation time for various physics scenarios while maintaining accuracy and fidelity.

Conclusion: The MD-PNOP framework effectively accelerates parametric PDE solvers, offering a physically constrained, architecture-agnostic solution applicable to diverse parameter distributions.

Abstract: The computational overhead of traditional numerical solvers for partial
differential equations (PDEs) remains a critical bottleneck for large-scale
parametric studies and design optimization. We introduce a Minimal-Data
Parametric Neural Operator Preconditioning (MD-PNOP) framework, which
establishes a new paradigm for accelerating parametric PDE solvers while
strictly preserving physical constraints. The key idea is to recast the
residual from parameter deviation as additional source term, where any trained
neural operator can be used to refine the solution in an offline fashion. This
directly addresses the fundamental extrapolation limitation of neural
operators, enabling extrapolative generalization of any neural operator trained
at a single parameter setting across a wide range of configurations without any
retraining. The neural operator predictions are then embedded into iterative
PDE solvers as improved initial guesses, thereby reducing convergence
iterations without sacrificing accuracy. Unlike purely data-driven approaches,
MD-PNOP guarantees that the governing equations remain fully enforced,
eliminating concerns about loss of physics or interpretability. The framework
is architecture-agnostic and is demonstrated using both Deep Operator Networks
(DeepONet) and Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) for Boltzmann transport equation
solvers in neutron transport applications. We demonstrated that neural
operators trained on a single set of constant parameters successfully
accelerate solutions with heterogeneous, sinusoidal, and discontinuous
parameter distributions. Besides, MD-PNOP consistently achieves ~50% reduction
in computational time while maintaining full order fidelity for fixed-source,
single-group eigenvalue, and multigroup coupled eigenvalue problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: These three objectives (reward maximization, safe exploration, intrinsic motivation) are typically treated separately in RL. The goal is to unify these into a single optimization framework for greater coherence and effectiveness.

Method: The authors introduce a geometric framework that operates in the space of achievable long-term behavior, allowing established RL methods to generalize under nonlinear utilities and constraints.

unified geometric framework, that views these goals as instances of a single
optimization problem on the space of achievable long-term behavior in an
environment. Within this framework, classical methods such as policy mirror
descent, natural policy gradient, and trust-region algorithms naturally
generalize to nonlinear utilities and convex constraints. We illustrate how
this perspective captures robustness, safety, exploration, and diversity
objectives, and outline open challenges at the interface of geometry and deep
RL.

### [607] [Hierarchical Motion Captioning Utilizing External Text Data Source](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01471)
*Clayton Leite,Yu Xiao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper enhances motion captioning by introducing a hierarchical approach that uses large language models and retrieval-based mechanisms for better high- and low-level motion captions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion-text datasets lack detailed low-level motion descriptions, which limits current motion captioning models.

Method: The paper introduces a two-step process: 1) utilizing large language models for generating detailed low-level annotations and retraining models, and 2) a retrieval-based approach to align low-level captions with high-level ones from external sources.

Result: Tests on three motion-text datasets (HumanML3D, KIT, BOTH57M) show a 6% to 50% performance improvement over the current state-of-the-art method (M2T-Interpretable).

Conclusion: The proposed methodology enhances motion captioning accuracy, especially for movements absent in existing datasets, by leveraging external text data and generating detailed annotations.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to enhance existing motion captioning
methods, which directly map representations of movement to high-level
descriptive captions (e.g., ``a person doing jumping jacks"). The existing
methods require motion data annotated with high-level descriptions (e.g.,
``jumping jacks"). However, such data is rarely available in existing
motion-text datasets, which additionally do not include low-level motion
descriptions. To address this, we propose a two-step hierarchical approach.
First, we employ large language models to create detailed descriptions
corresponding to each high-level caption that appears in the motion-text
datasets (e.g., ``jumping while synchronizing arm extensions with the opening
and closing of legs" for ``jumping jacks"). These refined annotations are used
to retrain motion-to-text models to produce captions with low-level details.
Second, we introduce a pioneering retrieval-based mechanism. It aligns the
detailed low-level captions with candidate high-level captions from additional
text data sources, and combine them with motion features to fabricate precise
high-level captions. Our methodology is distinctive in its ability to harness
knowledge from external text sources to greatly increase motion captioning
accuracy, especially for movements not covered in existing motion-text
datasets. Experiments on three distinct motion-text datasets (HumanML3D, KIT,
and BOTH57M) demonstrate that our method achieves an improvement in average
performance (across BLEU-1, BLEU-4, CIDEr, and ROUGE-L) ranging from 6% to 50%
compared to the state-of-the-art M2T-Interpretable.

*Jingyuan Zhou,Hao Qian,Shikui Tu,Lei Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PAFlow introduces a method to improve structure-based drug design by using flow matching and a size prediction mechanism, enhancing the binding affinity and alignment of molecules with protein targets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address issues in generative models for drug design, such as instability and mismatched geometry, to enhance binding affinity and reduce off-target effects.

Method: PAFlow uses efficient flow matching combined with conditional flow matching for atom type prediction, guided by protein-ligand interaction predictors and a size prediction mechanism.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on CrossDocked2020 with Avg. Vina Score of -8.31, and maintained good molecular properties.

Conclusion: PAFlow enhances molecular generation by better aligning molecule size and improving binding affinity, advancing drug discovery capabilities.

Abstract: Structure-based drug design (SBDD), aiming to generate 3D molecules with high
binding affinity toward target proteins, is a vital approach in novel drug
discovery. Although recent generative models have shown great potential, they
suffer from unstable probability dynamics and mismatch between generated
molecule size and the protein pockets geometry, resulting in inconsistent
quality and off-target effects. We propose PAFlow, a novel target-aware
molecular generation model featuring prior interaction guidance and a learnable
atom number predictor. PAFlow adopts the efficient flow matching framework to
model the generation process and constructs a new form of conditional flow
matching for discrete atom types. A protein-ligand interaction predictor is
incorporated to guide the vector field toward higher-affinity regions during
generation, while an atom number predictor based on protein pocket information
is designed to better align generated molecule size with target geometry.
Extensive experiments on the CrossDocked2020 benchmark show that PAFlow
achieves a new state-of-the-art in binding affinity (up to -8.31 Avg. Vina
Score), simultaneously maintains favorable molecular properties.

### [609] [Unsupervised Identification and Replay-based Detection (UIRD) for New Category Anomaly Detection in ECG Signal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01512)
*Zhangyue Shi,Zekai Wang,Yuxuan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a pseudo-replay based semi-supervised continual learning method for automatic ECG analysis, addressing class imbalance and storage constraints while effectively detecting novel and existing anomalies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance ECG anomaly detection performance and tackle challenges posed by class imbalance in ECG signals and increasing data storage requirements.

Method: The framework comprises two components: (1) Unsupervised identification using a GAN-based framework for detecting novel patterns, and (2) A pseudo-replay strategy utilizing a generator to simulate past learned data for continual learning and anomaly detection.

Result: Validated on four public ECG datasets, the framework shows promising results in identifying novel anomalies and maintaining strong performance in detecting existing ECG signals.

Conclusion: The proposed semi-supervised continual learning framework effectively addresses challenges in automatic ECG anomaly detection, offering a robust technique for handling class imbalance and storage limitations while improving anomaly detection.

Abstract: In clinical practice, automatic analysis of electrocardiogram (ECG) is widely
applied to identify irregular heart rhythms and other electrical anomalies of
the heart, enabling timely intervention and potentially improving clinical
outcomes. However, due to the limited samples in certain types of ECG signals,
the class imbalance issues pose a challenge for ECG-based detection. In
addition, as the volume of patient data grows, long-term storage of all
historical data becomes increasingly burdensome as training samples to
recognize new patterns and classify existing ECG signals accurately. Therefore,
to enhance the performance of anomaly detection while addressing storage
limitations, we propose a pseudo-replay based semi-supervised continual
learning framework, which consists of two components: unsupervised
identification and replay-based detection. For unsupervised identification, an
unsupervised generative adversarial network (GAN)-based framework is integrated
to detect novel patterns. Besides, instead of directly storing all historical
data, a pseudo replay-based learning strategy is proposed which utilizes a
generator to learn the data distribution for each individual task. When a new
task arises, the generator synthesizes pseudo data representative of previous
learnt classes, enabling the model to detect both the existed patterns and the
newly presented anomalies. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is
validated in four public ECG datasets, which leverages supervised
classification problems for anomaly detection. The experimental results show
that the developed approach is very promising in identifying novel anomalies
while maintaining good performance on detecting existing ECG signals.

### [610] [Forward-Only Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01533)
*Jiao Chen,Jiayi He,Fangfang Chen,Zuohong Lv,Jianhua Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FoRo proposes a forward-only continual learning approach to address catastrophic forgetting in pre-trained models, using prompt tuning and knowledge encoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current continual learning methods face catastrophic forgetting and inefficiency, especially in computationally-limited settings.

Method: FoRo utilizes lightweight prompt tuning optimized by CMA-ES and knowledge encoding through nonlinear random projection and recursive least squares.

Result: Experiments demonstrate reduced forgetting, higher accuracy, and improved efficiency with FoRo compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: FoRo provides a promising gradient-free approach for continual learning with pre-trained models, suitable for real-world applications.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a central challenge in continual learning
(CL) with pre-trained models. While existing approaches typically freeze the
backbone and fine-tune a small number of parameters to mitigate forgetting,
they still rely on iterative error backpropagation and gradient-based
optimization, which can be computationally intensive and less suitable for
resource-constrained environments. To address this, we propose FoRo, a
forward-only, gradient-free continual learning method. FoRo consists of a
lightweight prompt tuning strategy and a novel knowledge encoding mechanism,
both designed without modifying the pre-trained model. Specifically, prompt
embeddings are inserted at the input layer and optimized using the Covariance
Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES), which mitigates distribution
shifts and extracts high-quality task representations. Subsequently,
task-specific knowledge is encoded into a knowledge encoding matrix via
nonlinear random projection and recursive least squares, enabling incremental
updates to the classifier without revisiting prior data. Experiments show that
FoRo significantly reduces average forgetting and improves accuracy. Thanks to
forward-only learning, FoRo reduces memory usage and run time while maintaining
high knowledge retention across long task sequences. These results suggest that
FoRo could serve as a promising direction for exploring continual learning with
pre-trained models, especially in real-world multimedia applications where both
efficiency and effectiveness are critical.

### [611] [Graph Contrastive Learning versus Untrained Baselines: The Role of Dataset Size](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01541)
*Smayan Khanna,Doruk Efe Gökmen,Risi Kondor,Vincenzo Vitelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) performs unevenly when compared to untrained baselines like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), with its advantage dependent on dataset size and task difficulty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether GCL consistently outperforms untrained baselines and examine its effectiveness across varying dataset sizes and complexities.

Method: The paper compares GCL's performance against untrained GNNs, simple multilayer perceptrons, and handcrafted statistics across standardized, large-scale, and synthetic datasets.

Result: GCL shows varying results: it rivals or is surpassed by untrained baselines on smaller datasets, overtakes them on large datasets beyond a few thousand graphs, but then plateaus in performance.

Conclusion: Future research should focus on understanding the impact of dataset size in benchmarks and designing GCL algorithms that can overcome performance plateaus.

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has emerged as a leading paradigm for self-
supervised learning on graphs, with strong performance reported on standardized
datasets and growing applications ranging from genomics to drug discovery. We
ask a basic question: does GCL actually outperform untrained baselines? We find
that GCL's advantage depends strongly on dataset size and task difficulty. On
standard datasets, untrained Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), simple multilayer
perceptrons, and even handcrafted statistics can rival or exceed GCL. On the
large molecular dataset ogbg-molhiv, we observe a crossover: GCL lags at small
scales but pulls ahead beyond a few thousand graphs, though this gain
eventually plateaus. On synthetic datasets, GCL accuracy approximately scales
with the logarithm of the number of graphs and its performance gap (compared
with untrained GNNs) varies with respect to task complexity. Moving forward, it
is crucial to identify the role of dataset size in benchmarks and applications,
as well as to design GCL algorithms that avoid performance plateaus.

*Konstantin Mark,Leonard Galustian,Maximilian P. -P. Kovar,Esther Heid*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper extends steering methods to Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) by introducing Feynman-Kac steering and evaluates its use in challenging tasks like chemical reaction modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CFM is a fast and effective generative modeling method, but steering generated samples toward specific requirements remains unexplored for this approach.

Method: The authors propose tilting the output with an energy potential and derive Feynman-Kac steering for CFM for the first time. This is tested on synthetic tasks and high-dimensional challenges.

Result: The method successfully generates tilted distributions and solves the complex problem of modeling chemical reaction transition states while maintaining correct chirality.

Conclusion: Feynman-Kac steering effectively enhances CFM, enabling precise control over generative outputs, with applications in complex scientific challenges.

Abstract: Conditional Flow Matching(CFM) represents a fast and high-quality approach to
generative modelling, but in many applications it is of interest to steer the
generated samples towards precise requirements. While steering approaches like
gradient-based guidance, sequential Monte Carlo steering or Feynman-Kac
steering are well established for diffusion models, they have not been extended
to flow matching approaches yet. In this work, we formulate this requirement as
tilting the output with an energy potential. We derive, for the first time,
Feynman-Kac steering for CFM. We evaluate our approach on a set of synthetic
tasks, including the generation of tilted distributions in a high-dimensional
space, which is a particularly challenging case for steering approaches. We
then demonstrate the impact of Feynman-Kac steered CFM on the previously
unsolved challenge of generated transition states of chemical reactions with
the correct chirality, where the reactants or products can have a different
handedness, leading to geometric constraints of the viable reaction pathways
connecting reactants and products. Code to reproduce this study is avaiable

### [613] [Model Unmerging: Making Your Models Unmergeable for Secure Model Sharing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01548)
*Zihao Wang,Enneng Yang,Lu Yin,Shiwei Liu,Li Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes MergeLock, a method to prevent unauthorized model merging by disrupting model parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing availability of fine-tuned models raises concerns about unauthorized merging, which infringes on developers' rights and risks personal data leaks.

Method: MergeLock uses a transformation based on the symmetry in Transformer-based models to alter Query-Key and Value-Output branches, keeping the output consistent while making parameters incompatible for merging.

Result: MergeLock significantly degrades merged model performance by over 95% and remains robust to restoration attempts.

Conclusion: MergeLock effectively prevents unauthorized model merging and enhances model safety through active protection mechanisms.

Abstract: Model merging leverages multiple finetuned expert models to construct a
multi-task model with low cost, and is gaining increasing attention. However,
as a growing number of finetuned models become publicly available, concerns
about the safety of model merging have emerged. Unauthorized merging may
infringe on developers' rights and risk leaking sensitive personal information.
Most existing methods focus on detecting whether a merged model originates from
a specific source model, but fail to effectively prevent illegal merging. In
this paper, we propose MergeLock, an active protection mechanism that disrupts
model parameters to render them unmergeable, thereby directly preventing
unauthorized model merging. Specifically, leveraging the inherent symmetry of
the attention mechanism in Transformer-based models, we randomly sample two
pairs of invertible matrices and apply them to the Query-Key (QK) and
Value-Output (VO) branches. This transformation keeps the model's output
unchanged while pushing it away from the shared parameter space of other
finetuned models. Extensive experiments across both vision and language tasks
demonstrate that MergeLock can degrade the performance of merged models by over
95% when a protected model is involved in most cases, demonstrating its
effectiveness. Moreover, we further demonstrate that merged models protected by
MergeLock cannot be effectively recovered using low-cost restoration methods,
further enhancing robustness against unauthorized merging. The code is
available at https://github.com/hetailang/Merge-Lock.

### [614] [Direct Profit Estimation Using Uplift Modeling under Clustered Network Interference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01558)
*Bram van den Akker*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a methodology combining an interference-aware estimator (AddIPW) with uplift modeling to optimize incremental profit in recommendation systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard uplift modeling methods fail in the presence of interference, leading to suboptimal policies for real-world recommender systems. This paper aims to address this gap using advanced interference-aware methods.

Method: The proposed methodology incorporates the AddIPW estimator as a differentiable learning objective and combines it with established response transformation techniques for gradient-based optimization. This approach directly targets economic outcomes like incremental profit.

Result: Simulations demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms traditional, interference-naive approaches, especially when interference is significant.

Conclusion: Adopting interference-aware and profit-centric strategies improves the identification of high-impact interventions, paving the way for more effective and profitable incentive personalization in recommender systems.

Abstract: Uplift modeling is a key technique for promotion optimization in recommender
systems, but standard methods typically fail to account for interference, where
treating one item affects the outcomes of others. This violation of the Stable
Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) leads to suboptimal policies in
real-world marketplaces. Recent developments in interference-aware estimators
such as Additive Inverse Propensity Weighting (AddIPW) have not found their way
into the uplift modeling literature yet, and optimising policies using these
estimators is not well-established. This paper proposes a practical methodology
to bridge this gap. We use the AddIPW estimator as a differentiable learning
objective suitable for gradient-based optimization. We demonstrate how this
framework can be integrated with proven response transformation techniques to
directly optimize for economic outcomes like incremental profit. Through
simulations, we show that our approach significantly outperforms
interference-naive methods, especially as interference effects grow.
Furthermore, we find that adapting profit-centric uplift strategies within our
framework can yield superior performance in identifying the highest-impact
interventions, offering a practical path toward more profitable incentive
personalization.

*Louis Simon,Mohamed Chetouani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents Ema2Vec, a novel time embedding method for handling irregular self-report data, and demonstrates its effectiveness in predicting longitudinal stress.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenges posed by missing and irregular data from Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMA) for predicting human states and behaviors.

Method: Ema2Vec, a new time embedding method, is introduced to capture time dependencies in longitudinal EMA data, specifically tailored for irregularly spaced self-reports.

Result: Ema2Vec outperforms conventional fixed-window and non-time-aware models in predicting longitudinal stress, showcasing its efficacy.

Conclusion: Incorporating time embeddings is crucial for effectively modeling irregularly sampled longitudinal data, as demonstrated by the success of Ema2Vec.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of mobile and wearable sensing technologies has
enabled continuous and personalized monitoring of affect, mood disorders, and
stress. When combined with ecological self-report questionnaires, these systems
offer a powerful opportunity to explore longitudinal modeling of human
behaviors. However, challenges arise from missing data and the irregular timing
of self-reports, which make challenging the prediction of human states and
behaviors. In this study, we investigate the use of time embeddings to capture
time dependencies within sequences of Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMA).
We introduce a novel time embedding method, Ema2Vec, designed to effectively
handle irregularly spaced self-reports, and evaluate it on a new task of
longitudinal stress prediction. Our method outperforms standard stress
prediction baselines that rely on fixed-size daily windows, as well as models
trained directly on longitudinal sequences without time-aware representations.
These findings emphasize the importance of incorporating time embeddings when
modeling irregularly sampled longitudinal data.

### [616] [One-Shot Clustering for Federated Learning Under Clustering-Agnostic Assumption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01587)
*Maciej Krzysztof Zuziak,Roberto Pellungrini,Salvatore Rinzivillo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces One-Shot Clustered Federated Learning (OCFL), an automated method for CFL, which efficiently clusters clients using cosine distance of gradients and a temperature-based convergence measure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the problem of clustering clients in Clustered Federated Learning (CFL), which is critical for delivering personalized models but remains underexplored compared to traditional Federated Learning (FL).

Method: OCFL uses a clustering-agnostic algorithm that relies on cosine distance between client gradients and a temperature measure to detect the optimal moment for clustering. The method is evaluated empirically on over forty tasks using five datasets.

Result: OCFL demonstrates good performance in automating client clustering in CFL without hyperparameter tuning. Density-based clustering is highly effective when applied to gradients to differentiate neural network loss surfaces for personalized models.

Conclusion: OCFL advances CFL by automating client clustering and enhancing personalization and explainability of predictions. The approach also validates the efficiency of gradient-based density clustering in this domain.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a widespread and well-adopted paradigm of
decentralised learning that allows training one model from multiple sources
without the need to transfer data between participating clients directly. Since
its inception in 2015, it has been divided into numerous subfields that deal
with application-specific issues, such as data heterogeneity or resource
allocation. One such sub-field, Clustered Federated Learning (CFL), deals with
the problem of clustering the population of clients into separate cohorts to
deliver personalised models. Although a few remarkable works have been
published in this domain, the problem remains largely unexplored, as its basic
assumptions and settings differ slightly from those of standard FL. In this
work, we present One-Shot Clustered Federated Learning (OCFL), a
clustering-agnostic algorithm that can automatically detect the earliest
suitable moment for clustering. Our algorithm is based on computing the cosine
distance between the gradients of the clients and a temperature measure that
detects when the federated model starts to converge. We empirically evaluate
our methodology by testing various one-shot clustering algorithms for over
forty different tasks on five benchmark datasets. Our experiments showcase the
good performance of our approach when used to perform CFL in an automated
manner without the need to adjust hyperparameters. We also revisit the
practical feasibility of CFL algorithms based on the gradients of the clients,
providing firm evidence of the high efficiency of density-based clustering
methods when used to differentiate between the loss surfaces of neural networks
trained on different distributions. Moreover, by inspecting the feasibility of
local explanations generated with the help of GradCAM, we can provide more
insights into the relationship between personalisation and the explainability
of local predictions.

*Tianye Fang,Xuanshu Luo,Martin Werner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel framework combining entropy-driven curriculum learning with multi-task learning to improve human mobility prediction results using deep learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in predicting human mobility due to diverse complexity in data and neglecting implicit determinants like distances and directions.

Method: Utilizes an entropy-driven curriculum learning strategy for organizing training from simple to complex and incorporates multi-task training to optimize location prediction alongside auxiliary movement-related estimations.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance in mobility prediction with metrics GEO-BLEU (0.354) and DTW (26.15), and improved convergence speed by up to 2.92 times.

Conclusion: Integrating curriculum learning and multi-task frameworks enhances prediction accuracy and training efficiency for human mobility applications.

Abstract: The increasing availability of big mobility data from ubiquitous portable
devices enables human mobility prediction through deep learning approaches.
However, the diverse complexity of human mobility data impedes model training,
leading to inefficient gradient updates and potential underfitting. Meanwhile,
exclusively predicting next locations neglects implicit determinants, including
distances and directions, thereby yielding suboptimal prediction results. This
paper presents a unified training framework that integrates entropy-driven
curriculum and multi-task learning to address these challenges. The proposed
entropy-driven curriculum learning strategy quantifies trajectory
predictability based on Lempel-Ziv compression and organizes training from
simple to complex for faster convergence and enhanced performance. The
multi-task training simultaneously optimizes the primary location prediction
alongside auxiliary estimation of movement distance and direction for learning
realistic mobility patterns, and improve prediction accuracy through
complementary supervision signals. Extensive experiments conducted in
accordance with the HuMob Challenge demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance on GEO-BLEU (0.354) and DTW (26.15) metrics with
up to 2.92-fold convergence speed compared to training without curriculum
learning.

TL;DR: The paper highlights the equivalence between the Relative Trajectory Balance (RTB) objective and Trust-PCL in the context of KL-regularized RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the connections between RTB in GFlowNets and KL-regularized RL methods, and to clarify its theoretical and practical implications.

Method: The authors establish a theoretical equivalence between RTB and Trust-PCL and revisit previous examples to validate this connection.

Result: They demonstrate that KL-regularized RL methods achieve comparable performance to RTB in specific settings.

Conclusion: The paper situates RTB within the broader landscape of KL-regularized RL, providing new clarity and perspectives on its utility.

Abstract: Recent progress in generative modeling has highlighted the importance of
Reinforcement Learning (RL) for fine-tuning, with KL-regularized methods in
particular proving to be highly effective for both autoregressive and diffusion
models. Complementing this line of work, the Relative Trajectory Balance (RTB)
objective was recently introduced in the context of Generative Flow Networks
(GFlowNets) to serve the same role of improving fine-tuning in sequential
generative models. Building on prior work linking GFlowNets and maximum-entropy
RL, we establish in this paper an equivalence between RTB and Trust-PCL, an
off-policy RL method with KL regularization. This equivalence situates RTB
within the broader theoretical landscape of KL-regularized RL, and clarifies
its relationship to earlier methods. Leveraging this insight, we revisit an
illustrative example from the RTB paper and show that KL-regularized RL methods
achieve comparable performance, offering an alternative perspective to what was
previously reported.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a new multimodal dataset for cognitive load detection, systematically evaluating models for predictive performance and cross-domain generalization. Multimodal approaches outperform unimodal baselines, but challenges remain in transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of generalizability in current task load detection models for real-world applications beyond narrow experimental domains.

Method: A novel multimodal dataset is introduced, extending cognitive load benchmarks using real-world gaming data and the $n$-back test. Models like xLSTM, ConvNeXt, and Transformers are tested on various modalities and domains.

Result: Multimodal approaches consistently outperform unimodal ones, but models exhibit reduced performance when transferred to novel application domains, indicating limited cross-domain generalization.

Conclusion: The study establishes robust baselines and offers insights for developing generalizable cognitive load detection systems, paving the way for advancements in human-computer interaction and adaptive systems.

Abstract: Task load detection is essential for optimizing human performance across
diverse applications, yet current models often lack generalizability beyond
narrow experimental domains. While prior research has focused on individual
tasks and limited modalities, there remains a gap in evaluating model
robustness and transferability in real-world scenarios. This paper addresses
these limitations by introducing a new multimodal dataset that extends
established cognitive load detection benchmarks with a real-world gaming
application, using the $n$-back test as a scientific foundation. Task load
annotations are derived from objective performance, subjective NASA-TLX
ratings, and task-level design, enabling a comprehensive evaluation framework.
State-of-the-art end-to-end model, including xLSTM, ConvNeXt, and Transformer
architectures are systematically trained and evaluated on multiple modalities
and application domains to assess their predictive performance and cross-domain
generalization. Results demonstrate that multimodal approaches consistently
outperform unimodal baselines, with specific modalities and model architectures
showing varying impact depending on the application subset. Importantly, models
trained on one domain exhibit reduced performance when transferred to novel
applications, underscoring remaining challenges for universal cognitive load
estimation. These findings provide robust baselines and actionable insights for
developing more generalizable cognitive load detection systems, advancing both
research and practical implementation in human-computer interaction and
adaptive systems.

*Sachin Goyal,David Lopez-Paz,Kartik Ahuja*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the effects of distillation during large language model (LLM) pretraining on test-time scaling and in-context learning, finding mixed outcomes and providing actionable insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the largely unexamined effects of distillation on test-time scaling and in-context learning, key features of modern LLMs.

Method: Analyzed the impact of distillation on pretraining through a three-pronged approach: measuring test-time scaling, examining in-context learning impairments, and conducting sandbox experiments to isolate causative factors.

Result: Distillation significantly improves test-time scaling but harms in-context learning, particularly induction head modeling. Sandbox experiments identified a principal factor behind these observations.

Conclusion: Distilled pretraining presents trade-offs between test-time scaling and in-context learning, offering informed design recommendations for practitioners.

Abstract: In the past year, distillation has seen a renewed prominence in large
language model (LLM) pretraining, exemplified by the Llama-3.2 and Gemma model
families. While distillation has historically been shown to improve statistical
modeling, its effects on new paradigms that are key to modern LLMs, such as
test-time scaling and in-context learning, remain underexplored. In this work,
we make three main contributions. First, we show that pretraining with
distillation yields models that exhibit remarkably better test-time scaling.
Second, we observe that this benefit comes with a trade-off: distillation
impairs in-context learning capabilities, particularly the one modeled via
induction heads. Third, to demystify these findings, we study distilled
pretraining in a sandbox of a bigram model, which helps us isolate the common
principal factor behind our observations. Finally, using these insights, we
shed light on various design choices for pretraining that should help
practitioners going forward.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RL-based agents supported by smaller models to tackle ML engineering tasks, showing they can outperform larger static models by 22% across 12 Kaggle tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ML engineering agents relying on static, large language models fail to improve despite increasing experience, highlighting the need for agents that can learn and adapt.

Method: Develop an asynchronous RL framework with duration-aware gradient updates to improve long-duration actions and implement partial credit rewards via environment instrumentation, backed by a smaller model (Qwen2.5-3B).

Result: The RL-based agent demonstrated superior performance to static large-model agents, achieving an average 22% improvement in task performance.

Conclusion: Integrating RL with smaller agents enables continuous learning and adaptability, outperforming static scaffolding approaches by leveraging partial credit rewards and efficient gradient updates.

Abstract: Existing agents for solving tasks such as ML engineering rely on prompting
powerful language models. As a result, these agents do not improve with more
experience. In this paper, we show that agents backed by weaker models that
improve via reinforcement learning (RL) can outperform agents backed by much
larger, but static models. We identify two major challenges with RL in this
setting. First, actions can take a variable amount of time (e.g., executing
code for different solutions), which leads to asynchronous policy gradient
updates that favor faster but suboptimal solutions. To tackle variable-duration
actions, we propose duration- aware gradient updates in a distributed
asynchronous RL framework to amplify high-cost but high-reward actions. Second,
using only test split performance as a reward provides limited feedback. A
program that is nearly correct is treated the same as one that fails entirely.
To address this, we propose environment instrumentation to offer partial
credit, distinguishing almost-correct programs from those that fail early
(e.g., during data loading). Environment instrumentation uses a separate static
language model to insert print statement to an existing program to log the
agent's experimental progress, from which partial credit can be extracted as
reward signals for learning. Our experimental results on MLEBench suggest that
performing gradient updates on a much smaller model (Qwen2.5-3B) trained with
RL outperforms prompting a much larger model (Claude-3.5-Sonnet) with agent
scaffolds, by an average of 22% across 12 Kaggle tasks.

### [622] [Robust Anomaly Detection through Multi-Modal Autoencoder Fusion for Small Vehicle Damage Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01719)
*Sara Khan,Mehmed Yüksel,Frank Kirchner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel anomaly detection mechanism using multi-modal sensors for real-time vehicle damage detection, achieving 92% ROC-AUC performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from inefficiencies in manual inspection methods and existing image-based techniques in detecting minor vehicle damage, especially underbody issues in rental and fleet systems.

Method: A compact device with IMUs and microphones mounted on the windshield is proposed, using multi-modal autoencoder-based architectures for anomaly detection.

Result: An ensemble pooling multi-modal model demonstrated superior performance with a ROC-AUC of 92%, outperforming unimodal and existing methods.

Conclusion: This method provides an efficient solution for real-time vehicle damage detection and holds potential for applications in automotive safety and autonomous vehicles.

Abstract: Wear and tear detection in fleet and shared vehicle systems is a critical
challenge, particularly in rental and car-sharing services, where minor damage,
such as dents, scratches, and underbody impacts, often goes unnoticed or is
detected too late. Currently, manual inspection methods are the default
approach but are labour intensive and prone to human error. In contrast,
state-of-the-art image-based methods struggle with real-time performance and
are less effective at detecting underbody damage due to limited visual access
and poor spatial coverage. This work introduces a novel multi-modal
architecture based on anomaly detection to address these issues. Sensors such
as IMUs and microphones are integrated into a compact device mounted on the
vehicle's windshield. This approach supports real-time damage detection while
avoiding the need for highly resource-intensive sensors. We developed multiple
variants of multi-modal autoencoder-based architectures and evaluated them
against unimodal and state-of-the-art methods. Our ensemble pooling multi-modal
model achieved the highest performance, with a Receiver Operating
Characteristic-Area Under Curve (ROC-AUC) of 92%, demonstrating its
effectiveness in real-world applications. This approach can also be extended to
other applications, such as improving automotive safety - where it can
integrate with airbag systems for efficient deployment - and helping autonomous
vehicles by complementing other sensors in collision detection.

*Georgios Papoudakis,Thomas Coste,Jianye Hao,Jun Wang,Kun Shao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a reinforcement learning method, SoLS, targeting challenges in policy approximation using foundation models for multi-turn tasks. Results show superior performance and efficiency compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in RL with foundation models for multi-turn tasks, such as sparse rewards and policy gradient updates that affect model performance.

Method: Introduce SoLS, an off-policy RL algorithm using direct updates for positive samples and conservative updates for negative samples, paired with STR to prioritize learning from successes.

Result: SoLS achieves significant improvements (17%+ relative increase) in sample efficiency and performance on AndroidWorld tasks, requiring fewer resources compared to alternatives like GPT-4o.

Conclusion: SoLS addresses limitations in RL for policy approximation and facilitates efficient learning, showcasing potential in mobile app control tasks and user interface navigation.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) using foundation models for policy approximations
in multi-turn tasks remains challenging. We identify two main limitations
related to sparse reward settings and policy gradient updates, based on which
we formulate a key insight: updates from positive samples with high returns
typically do not require policy regularisation, whereas updates from negative
samples, reflecting undesirable behaviour, can harm model performance. This
paper introduces Succeed or Learn Slowly (SoLS), a novel off-policy RL
algorithm evaluated on mobile app control tasks. SoLS improves sample
efficiency when fine-tuning foundation models for user interface navigation via
a modified off-policy actor-critic approach, applying direct policy updates for
positive samples and conservative, regularised updates for negative ones to
prevent model degradation. We augment SoLS with Successful Transition Replay
(STR), which prioritises learning from successful interactions, further
improving sample efficiency. We evaluate SoLS on the AndroidWorld benchmark,
where it significantly outperforms existing methods (at least 17% relative
increase), including prompt-engineering and RL approaches, while requiring
substantially fewer computational resources than GPT-4o-based methods with
5-60x faster inference.

### [624] [Convolutional Monge Mapping between EEG Datasets to Support Independent Component Labeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01721)
*Austin Meek,Carlos H. Mendoza-Cardenas,Austin J. Brockmeier*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an extension of Convolutional Monge Mapping Normalization (CMMN) for EEG signal normalization that enhances independent component (IC) classification tasks, achieving better identification of brain versus non-brain components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in EEG signal analysis caused by artifacts, equipment variabilities, and differences in recording context, which hinder machine learning performance.

Method: The authors propose two new approaches for spectral normalization in CMMN: (1) using a channel-averaged and $l_1$-normalized barycenter spectrum, and (2) subject-to-subject mapping to the closest spectrum. They also develop space-time separable filters to enable mappings between diverse datasets.

Result: The extended CMMN method significantly improves performance in independent component classification tasks, specifically in recognizing brain versus non-brain ICs.

Conclusion: The proposed CMMN extension demonstrates the potential to enhance EEG analysis pipelines by mitigating the effects of equipment variability and noise, thereby supporting clinical applications like diagnosing neuropathologies.

Abstract: EEG recordings contain rich information about neural activity but are subject
to artifacts, noise, and superficial differences due to sensors, amplifiers,
and filtering. Independent component analysis and automatic labeling of
independent components (ICs) enable artifact removal in EEG pipelines.
Convolutional Monge Mapping Normalization (CMMN) is a recent tool used to
achieve spectral conformity of EEG signals, which was shown to improve deep
neural network approaches for sleep staging. Here we propose a novel extension
of the CMMN method with two alternative approaches to computing the source
reference spectrum the target signals are mapped to: (1) channel-averaged and
$l_1$-normalized barycenter, and (2) a subject-to-subject mapping that finds
the source subject with the closest spectrum to the target subject. Notably,
our extension yields space-time separable filters that can be used to map
between datasets with different numbers of EEG channels. We apply these filters
in an IC classification task, and show significant improvement in recognizing
brain versus non-brain ICs.
  Clinical relevance - EEG recordings are used in the diagnosis and monitoring
of multiple neuropathologies, including epilepsy and psychosis. While EEG
analysis can benefit from automating artifact removal through independent
component analysis and labeling, differences in recording equipment and context
(the presence of noise from electrical wiring and other devices) may impact the
performance of machine learning models, but these differences can be minimized
by appropriate spectral normalization through filtering.

### [625] [BM-CL: Bias Mitigation through the lens of Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01730)
*Lucas Mansilla,Rodrigo Echeveste,Camila Gonzalez,Diego H. Milone,Enzo Ferrante*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses biases in machine learning by proposing a framework, Bias Mitigation through Continual Learning (BM-CL), which aims to reduce bias for disadvantaged groups without negatively impacting advantaged groups' performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bias in machine learning models can amplify disparities against disadvantaged groups, and traditional techniques often degrade performance for advantaged groups. This motivates the need for a more balanced bias mitigation approach.

Method: The paper utilizes principles of continual learning, drawing from techniques like Learning without Forgetting and Elastic Weight Consolidation, to reinterpret bias mitigation as a domain-incremental continual learning problem, where models adjust fairness objectives incrementally.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that BM-CL effectively mitigates biases while preserving the original knowledge and performance for advantaged groups.

Conclusion: The research bridges fairness and continual learning, introducing a framework that balances equity and effectiveness, and provides a promising solution for bias mitigation in machine learning systems.

Abstract: Biases in machine learning pose significant challenges, particularly when
models amplify disparities that affect disadvantaged groups. Traditional bias
mitigation techniques often lead to a {\itshape leveling-down effect}, whereby
improving outcomes of disadvantaged groups comes at the expense of reduced
performance for advantaged groups. This study introduces Bias Mitigation
through Continual Learning (BM-CL), a novel framework that leverages the
principles of continual learning to address this trade-off. We postulate that
mitigating bias is conceptually similar to domain-incremental continual
learning, where the model must adjust to changing fairness conditions,
improving outcomes for disadvantaged groups without forgetting the knowledge
that benefits advantaged groups. Drawing inspiration from techniques such as
Learning without Forgetting and Elastic Weight Consolidation, we reinterpret
bias mitigation as a continual learning problem. This perspective allows models
to incrementally balance fairness objectives, enhancing outcomes for
disadvantaged groups while preserving performance for advantaged groups.
Experiments on synthetic and real-world image datasets, characterized by
diverse sources of bias, demonstrate that the proposed framework mitigates
biases while minimizing the loss of original knowledge. Our approach bridges
the fields of fairness and continual learning, offering a promising pathway for
developing machine learning systems that are both equitable and effective.

### [626] [Communication-Aware Knowledge Distillation for Federated LLM Fine-Tuning over Wireless Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01750)
*Xinlu Zhang,Na Yan,Yang Su,Yansha Deng,Toktam Mahmoodi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel federated distillation approach for large language models (LLMs) that reduces communication overhead by approximately 50% while maintaining strong performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of high communication overhead and adaptation to heterogeneous model architectures in federated learning for LLMs, especially for bandwidth-constrained clients.

Method: The method introduces three key techniques: (1) an adaptive Top-k logit selection mechanism for communication-efficient sparsification, (2) an adaptive logits aggregation scheme to handle dimensional inconsistencies without using zero-padding, and (3) LoRA-adapted hidden-layer projection incorporated into distillation loss for richer representation and reduced communication.

Result: The proposed scheme outperforms baseline methods in performance while cutting communication overhead by nearly half.

Conclusion: The approach effectively improves federated learning for LLMs by solving communication efficiency issues and achieving superior knowledge distillation results.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) for large language models (LLMs) offers a
privacy-preserving scheme, enabling clients to collaboratively fine-tune
locally deployed LLMs or smaller language models (SLMs) without exchanging raw
data. While parameter-sharing methods in traditional FL models solves number of
technical challenges, they still incur high communication overhead and struggle
with adapting to heterogeneous model architectures. Federated distillation, a
framework for mutual knowledge transfer via shared logits, typically offers
lower communication overhead than parameter-sharing methods. However,
transmitting logits from LLMs remains challenging for bandwidth-limited clients
due to their high dimensionality. In this work, we focus on a federated LLM
distillation with efficient communication overhead. To achieve this, we first
propose an adaptive Top-k logit selection mechanism, dynamically sparsifying
logits according to real-time communication conditions. Then to tackle the
dimensional inconsistency introduced by the adaptive sparsification, we design
an adaptive logits aggregation scheme, effectively alleviating the artificial
and uninformative inputs introduced by conventional zero-padding methods.
Finally, to enhance the distillation effect, we incorporate LoRA-adapted
hidden-layer projection from LLM into the distillation loss, reducing the
communication overhead further while providing richer representation.
Experimental results demonstrate that our scheme achieves superior performance
compared to baseline methods while effectively reducing communication overhead
by approximately 50%.

### [627] [Toward a Unified Benchmark and Taxonomy of Stochastic Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01793)
*Aryan Amit Barsainyan,Jing Yu Lim,Dianbo Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmark called STORI to rigorously assess Reinforcement Learning methods under diverse stochastic effects, and proposes a taxonomy of stochasticity in RL environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL benchmarks primarily address deterministic or overly simplified scenarios and fail to evaluate robustness in stochastic and partially observable environments.

Method: The authors propose STORI as a benchmark for RL methods, incorporating varied stochastic effects, and introduce a taxonomy of stochasticity to provide a unified evaluation framework.

Result: The benchmark STORI successfully addresses the gap in evaluating RL methods under different forms of uncertainty and stochastic conditions.

Conclusion: STORI and the taxonomy provide essential tools for advancing RL robustness and systematically evaluating methods in challenging, real-world-like scenarios.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents have achieved strong results on benchmarks
such as Atari100k, yet they remain limited in robustness to real-world
conditions. Model-Based RL approaches that rely on learned World Models often
struggle in environments with true stochasticity and partial observability,
despite their theoretical grounding in POMDPs. Current benchmarks rarely
capture these challenges, focusing instead on deterministic or overly
simplified settings, and the lack of a clear taxonomy of stochasticity further
hampers systematic evaluation. To address this gap, we introduce STORI
(STOchastic-ataRI), a benchmark that incorporates diverse stochastic effects
and enables rigorous assessment of RL methods under varied forms of
uncertainty. In addition, we propose a taxonomy of stochasticity in RL
environments, providing a unified framework for analyzing and comparing
approaches.

*Trusting Inekwe,Emmanuel Agu,Winnie Mkandawire,Andres Colubri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduces MBT-CB, a machine learning model based on Bayesian Transformers, for accurately predicting critical cardiovascular disease (CVD) biomarkers during the COVID-19 pandemic using electronic health records.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted healthcare delivery, significantly affecting individuals with CVD by altering key biomarkers such as LDL cholesterol, HbA1c, BMI, and blood pressure. Modeling these changes accurately is essential for disease management and preventive care but existing methods fail to address multi-target prediction capturing biomarker relationships, time-series patterns, and predictive uncertainty.

Method: The authors developed MBT-CB, a Multi-target Bayesian Transformer model utilizing a pre-trained BERT-based framework. It integrates Bayesian Variational Inference for uncertainty estimation, temporal embedding for sequential data, and a DeepMTR framework to account for biomarker interdependencies.

Result: The model was tested on EHR data from 3,390 records (304 unique patients) in Massachusetts. MBT-CB surpassed baseline models, achieving impressive metrics (MAE: 0.00887, RMSE: 0.0135, MSE: 0.00027) while capturing uncertainty, biomarker relationships, and temporal trends.

Conclusion: MBT-CB demonstrated strong predictive capabilities and robustness, proving its utility for CVD biomarker prediction and aiding clinical decision-making, especially under challenging conditions like the COVID-19 pandemic.

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted healthcare systems worldwide,
disproportionately impacting individuals with chronic conditions such as
cardiovascular disease (CVD). These disruptions -- through delayed care and
behavioral changes, affected key CVD biomarkers, including LDL cholesterol
(LDL-C), HbA1c, BMI, and systolic blood pressure (SysBP). Accurate modeling of
these changes is crucial for predicting disease progression and guiding
preventive care. However, prior work has not addressed multi-target prediction
of CVD biomarker from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) using machine learning
(ML), while jointly capturing biomarker interdependencies, temporal patterns,
and predictive uncertainty. In this paper, we propose MBT-CB, a Multi-target
Bayesian Transformer (MBT) with pre-trained BERT-based transformer framework to
jointly predict LDL-C, HbA1c, BMI and SysBP CVD biomarkers from EHR data. The
model leverages Bayesian Variational Inference to estimate uncertainties,
embeddings to capture temporal relationships and a DeepMTR model to capture
biomarker inter-relationships. We evaluate MBT-CT on retrospective EHR data
from 3,390 CVD patient records (304 unique patients) in Central Massachusetts
during the Covid-19 pandemic. MBT-CB outperformed a comprehensive set of
baselines including other BERT-based ML models, achieving an MAE of 0.00887,
RMSE of 0.0135 and MSE of 0.00027, while effectively capturing data and model
uncertainty, patient biomarker inter-relationships, and temporal dynamics via
its attention and embedding mechanisms. MBT-CB's superior performance
highlights its potential to improve CVD biomarker prediction and support
clinical decision-making during pandemics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces the TSAIA Benchmark to assess Large Language Models (LLMs) as time-series AI assistants, providing rigorous task-specific evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the unexplored potential of LLMs in conducting complex reasoning and multi-step analysis in real-world time-series tasks, emphasizing the need for robust evaluation tools.

Method: The authors developed the TSAIA Benchmark, a dynamic and extensible evaluation framework based on 33 real-world task formulations from surveyed academic works, with task-specific success criteria and metrics.

Result: Applying the TSAIA Benchmark to eight state-of-the-art LLMs revealed their limitations in handling complex time-series analysis workflows, highlighting the necessity for domain-adapted methodologies.

Conclusion: The TSAIA Benchmark serves as a critical tool for evaluating LLMs in time-series analysis, revealing significant gaps in current models and paving the way for specialized advancements in the field.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked growing
interest in their application to time series analysis tasks. However, their
ability to perform complex reasoning over temporal data in real-world
application domains remains underexplored. To move toward this goal, a first
step is to establish a rigorous benchmark dataset for evaluation. In this work,
we introduce the TSAIA Benchmark, a first attempt to evaluate LLMs as
time-series AI assistants. To ensure both scientific rigor and practical
relevance, we surveyed over 20 academic publications and identified 33
real-world task formulations. The benchmark encompasses a broad spectrum of
challenges, ranging from constraint-aware forecasting to anomaly detection with
threshold calibration: tasks that require compositional reasoning and
multi-step time series analysis. The question generator is designed to be
dynamic and extensible, supporting continuous expansion as new datasets or task
types are introduced. Given the heterogeneous nature of the tasks, we adopt
task-specific success criteria and tailored inference-quality metrics to ensure
meaningful evaluation for each task. We apply this benchmark to assess eight
state-of-the-art LLMs under a unified evaluation protocol. Our analysis reveals
limitations in current models' ability to assemble complex time series analysis
workflows, underscoring the need for specialized methodologies for
domain-specific adaptation. Our benchmark is available at

*Vaishnav Vaidheeswaran,Dilith Jayakody,Samruddhi Mulay,Anand Lo,Md Mahbub Alam,Gabriel Spadon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a reinforcement learning-based approach for efficient vessel routing in complex waterways using data-driven traffic graphs and environmental conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Narrow and dynamic waterways present challenges for vessel routing, compounded by changing environmental conditions and the need for generalized solutions across varied origin-destination pairs.

Method: The approach employs reinforcement learning with multi-discrete action spaces, leveraging AIS-derived traffic graphs and wind data to balance fuel efficiency, travel time, and other constraints.

Result: Experiments in the Gulf of St. Lawrence showed improved policy performance, particularly with action masking and feedback combining penalties and shaping rewards.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates potential for optimizing vessel routing in diverse conditions by integrating data-driven insights, reinforcement learning techniques, and strategic reward shaping.

Abstract: Routing vessels through narrow and dynamic waterways is challenging due to
changing environmental conditions and operational constraints. Existing
vessel-routing studies typically fail to generalize across multiple
origin-destination pairs and do not exploit large-scale, data-driven traffic
graphs. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning solution for big
maritime data that can learn to find a route across multiple origin-destination
pairs while adapting to different hexagonal grid resolutions. Agents learn to
select direction and speed under continuous observations in a multi-discrete
action space. A reward function balances fuel efficiency, travel time, wind
resistance, and route diversity, using an Automatic Identification System
(AIS)-derived traffic graph with ERA5 wind fields. The approach is demonstrated
in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, one of the largest estuaries in the world. We
evaluate configurations that combine Proximal Policy Optimization with
recurrent networks, invalid-action masking, and exploration strategies. Our
experiments demonstrate that action masking yields a clear improvement in
policy performance and that supplementing penalty-only feedback with positive
shaping rewards produces additional gains.

*Weicao Deng,Sangwoo Park,Min Li,Osvaldo Simeone*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses limitations in Conformal Prediction (CP) methods by proposing an enhanced framework, E-ICL+FCP, achieving reliable predictions while improving computational efficiency and data usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CP methods face limitations: SCP has data inefficiency due to dataset partitioning, and FCP has computational complexity from retraining. Improving these methods while maintaining guarantees is essential for trustworthy AI.

Method: The paper introduces E-ICL+FCP, which uses an in-context learning model trained with a CP-specific loss to simulate multiple retrained models. This avoids retraining, reduces inefficiency, and preserves predictive coverage.

Result: E-ICL+FCP demonstrates better efficiency-coverage trade-offs in experiments on synthetic and real datasets, outperforming SCP and FCP baselines.

Conclusion: E-ICL+FCP successfully addresses the trade-offs in existing CP methods by reducing both computational overhead and data inefficiency while maintaining reliable uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification is critical for trustworthy AI. Conformal
Prediction (CP) provides prediction sets with distribution-free coverage
guarantees, but its two main variants face complementary limitations. Split CP
(SCP) suffers from data inefficiency due to dataset partitioning, while full CP
(FCP) improves data efficiency at the cost of prohibitive retraining
complexity. Recent approaches based on meta-learning or in-context learning
(ICL) partially mitigate these drawbacks. However, they rely on training
procedures not specifically tailored to CP, which may yield large prediction
sets. We introduce an efficient FCP framework, termed enhanced ICL-based FCP
(E-ICL+FCP), which employs a permutation-invariant Transformer-based ICL model
trained with a CP-aware loss. By simulating the multiple retrained models
required by FCP without actual retraining, E-ICL+FCP preserves coverage while
markedly reducing both inefficiency and computational overhead. Experiments on
synthetic and real tasks demonstrate that E-ICL+FCP attains superior
efficiency-coverage trade-offs compared to existing SCP and FCP baselines.

*Qifu Wen,Xi Zeng,Zihan Zhou,Shuaijun Liu,Mehdi Hosseinzadeh,Reza Rawassizadeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GradES is a novel early stopping approach that speeds up transformer training by halting parameter updates selectively based on gradient convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Validating large transformer models is computationally expensive, and stopping all parameter updates at once can lead to inefficiencies and overfitting.

Method: GradES tracks gradient magnitudes during training for individual transformer matrices and stops updates when gradients fall below a threshold, circumventing the need for global validation checks.

Result: GradES reduces training time by 1.57--7.22x while improving generalization with a 1.2% average accuracy increase.

Conclusion: GradES provides an efficient and selective alternative to traditional early stopping, reducing computational costs and improving model performance.

Abstract: Early stopping monitors global validation loss and halts all parameter
updates simultaneously, which is computationally costly for large transformers
due to the extended time required for validation inference. We propose GradES,
a novel gradient-based early stopping approach that operates within transformer
components (attention projections and Feed-Forward layer matrices). We found
that different components converge at varying rates during fine-tuning. GradES
tracks the magnitude of gradients in backpropagation for these matrices during
training. When a projection matrix's gradients fall below a convergence
threshold $\tau$, we exclude that projection matrix from further updates
individually, eliminating costly validation passes while allowing slow
converging matrices to continue learning. By strategically freezing parameters
when their gradients converge, GradES speeds up training time by
1.57--7.22$\times$ while simultaneously enhancing generalization through early
prevention of overfitting, resulting in 1.2% higher average accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the 'Signed Quadratic Shrink' (SQS) activation function to improve weight-based interpretability in machine learning models while maintaining competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing weight-based feature analysis methods, which suffer from reduced performance and data inefficiency, and to enhance interpretability by deriving features from model weights.

Method: The authors developed an activation function named Signed Quadratic Shrink (SQS) and applied it to Gated Linear Units (GLUs) to enable interpretable features directly from network weights, avoiding common drawbacks of current techniques.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that SQS activation offers state-of-the-art competitive performance and facilitates weight-based interpretability in neural networks.

Conclusion: SQS successfully overcomes the limitations of existing methods by combining competitive model performance with improved interpretability through weight analysis.

Abstract: Understanding the inner workings of machine learning models is critical for
ensuring their reliability and robustness. Whilst many techniques in
mechanistic interpretability focus on activation driven analyses, being able to
derive meaningful features directly from the weights of a neural network would
provide greater guarantees and more computational efficiency. Existing
techniques for analyzing model features through weights suffer from drawbacks
such as reduced performance and data inefficiency. In this paper, we introduce
Signed Quadratic Shrink (SQS), an activation function designed to allow Gated
Linear Units (GLUs) to learn interpretable features without these drawbacks.
Our experimental results show that SQS achieves performance competitive with
state-of-the-art activation functions whilst enabling weight-based
interpretability

TL;DR: This paper proposes a semi-on-demand feeder service for public transit using shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) controlled by reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance accessibility in lower-density areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve accessibility and efficiency for lower-density areas by combining aspects of fixed-route transit and demand-responsive transport.

Method: The paper uses reinforcement learning (Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm) for dynamically assigning SAVs to flexible-route zones based on real-time demand. Simulations are conducted for a bus route in Munich.

Result: The RL-enabled service serves 16% more passengers at 13% higher costs compared to traditional fixed routes. Efficiency improvements enabled by RL bring smaller gains of 2.4% more passengers at 1.4% higher costs.

Conclusion: Integrating SAVs and machine learning into public transit offers promising improvements for addressing first-mile-last-mile challenges in multimodal transit systems.

Abstract: This paper develops a semi-on-demand transit feeder service using shared
autonomous vehicles (SAVs) and zonal dispatching control based on reinforcement
learning (RL). This service combines the cost-effectiveness of fixed-route
transit with the adaptability of demand-responsive transport to improve
accessibility in lower-density areas. Departing from the terminus, SAVs first
make scheduled fixed stops, then offer on-demand pick-ups and drop-offs in a
pre-determined flexible-route area. Our deep RL model dynamically assigns
vehicles to subdivided flexible-route zones in response to real-time demand
fluctuations and operations, using a policy gradient algorithm - Proximal
Policy Optimization. The methodology is demonstrated through agent-based
simulations on a real-world bus route in Munich, Germany. Results show that
after efficient training of the RL model, the semi-on-demand service with
dynamic zonal control serves 16% more passengers at 13% higher generalized
costs on average compared to traditional fixed-route service. The efficiency
gain brought by RL control brings 2.4% more passengers at 1.4% higher costs.
This study not only showcases the potential of integrating SAV feeders and
machine learning techniques into public transit, but also sets the groundwork
for further innovations in addressing first-mile-last-mile problems in
multimodal transit systems.

Result: AEDM outperforms commercial solvers by 16–69% in solution quality, operates in real-time (1–2 seconds), and generalizes well across diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: AEDM is a computationally efficient and high-quality solution, ideal for time-sensitive disaster response to improve emergency decision-making.

Abstract: Rapid post-disaster road damage assessment is critical for effective
emergency response, yet traditional optimization methods suffer from excessive
computational time and require domain knowledge for algorithm design, making
them unsuitable for time-sensitive disaster scenarios. This study proposes an
attention-based encoder-decoder model (AEDM) for real-time drone routing
decision in post-disaster road damage assessment. The method employs deep
reinforcement learning to determine high-quality drone assessment routes
without requiring algorithmic design knowledge. A network transformation method
is developed to convert link-based routing problems into equivalent node-based
formulations, while a synthetic road network generation technique addresses the
scarcity of large-scale training datasets. The model is trained using policy
optimization with multiple optima (POMO) with multi-task learning capabilities
to handle diverse parameter combinations. Experimental results demonstrate two
key strengths of AEDM: it outperforms commercial solvers by 16--69\% in
solution quality and achieves real-time inference (1--2 seconds) versus
100--2,000 seconds for traditional methods. The model exhibits strong
generalization across varying problem scales, drone numbers, and time
constraints, consistently outperforming baseline methods on unseen parameter
distributions and real-world road networks. The proposed method effectively
balances computational efficiency with solution quality, making it particularly
suitable for time-critical disaster response applications where rapid
decision-making is essential for saving lives.

### [636] [Predicting NCAP Safety Ratings: An Analysis of Vehicle Characteristics and ADAS Features Using Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01897)
*Raunak Kunwar,Aera Kim LeBoulluec*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study uses machine learning models to assess the predictive importance of vehicle attributes and ADAS features for achieving the highest NCAP safety ratings, finding an optimized Random Forest model with high accuracy and ROC AUC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance understanding of factors contributing to vehicle safety ratings, particularly examining the interaction between traditional characteristics and modern ADAS technologies.

Method: Analyzed NCAP data from 5,128 vehicle variants (2011-2025) using four machine learning models, optimized the best-performing models, and assessed predictive significance of features.

Result: The optimized Random Forest model achieved an accuracy of 89.18% and a ROC AUC of 0.9586, showing curb weight and model year as dominant predictors, with ADAS features providing significant contributions.

Conclusion: Machine learning can effectively be used to predict top safety ratings in NCAP, combining traditional vehicle attributes with ADAS features for strategic insights.

Abstract: Vehicle safety assessment is crucial for consumer information and regulatory
oversight. The New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) assigns standardized safety
ratings, which traditionally emphasize passive safety measures but now include
active safety technologies such as Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS).
It is crucial to understand how these various systems interact empirically.
This study explores whether particular ADAS features like Forward Collision
Warning, Lane Departure Warning, Crash Imminent Braking, and Blind Spot
Detection, together with established vehicle attributes (e.g., Curb Weight,
Model Year, Vehicle Type, Drive Train), can reliably predict a vehicle's
likelihood of earning the highest (5-star) overall NCAP rating. Using a
publicly available dataset derived from NCAP reports that contain approximately
5,128 vehicle variants spanning model years 2011-2025, we compared four
different machine learning models: logistic regression, random forest, gradient
boosting, and support vector classifier (SVC) using a 5-fold stratified
cross-validation approach. The two best-performing algorithms (random forest
and gradient boost) were hyperparameter optimized using RandomizedSearchCV.
Analysis of feature importance showed that basic vehicle characteristics,
specifically curb weight and model year, dominated predictive capability,
contributing more than 55% of the feature relevance of the Random Forest model.
However, the inclusion of ADAS features also provided meaningful predictive
contributions. The optimized Random Forest model achieved robust results on a
held-out test set, with an accuracy of 89.18% and a ROC AUC of 0.9586. This
research reveals the use of machine learning to analyze large-scale NCAP data
and highlights the combined predictive importance of both established vehicle
parameters and modern ADAS features to achieve top safety ratings.

### [637] [VISP: Volatility Informed Stochastic Projection for Adaptive Regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01903)
*Tanvir Islam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes VISP, a method that leverages gradient volatility in deep learning to dynamically guide noise injection, improving generalization performance and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address overfitting in neural networks by introducing a method that selectively applies regularization based on gradient volatility.

Method: VISP dynamically computes gradient volatility and scales a stochastic projection matrix to apply adaptive noise, focusing on inputs and nodes with high volatility.

Result: VISP improved generalization performance on datasets like MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN while also stabilizing network dynamics and fostering robust feature representations.

Conclusion: VISP offers an effective adaptive regularization approach, demonstrating improved generalization and insights into neural network stabilization and robustness.

Abstract: We propose VISP: Volatility Informed Stochastic Projection, an adaptive
regularization method that leverages gradient volatility to guide stochastic
noise injection in deep neural networks. Unlike conventional techniques that
apply uniform noise or fixed dropout rates, VISP dynamically computes
volatility from gradient statistics and uses it to scale a stochastic
projection matrix. This mechanism selectively regularizes inputs and hidden
nodes that exhibit higher gradient volatility while preserving stable
representations, thereby mitigating overfitting. Extensive experiments on
MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN demonstrate that VISP consistently improves
generalization performance over baseline models and fixed-noise alternatives.
In addition, detailed analyses of the evolution of volatility, the spectral
properties of the projection matrix, and activation distributions reveal that
VISP not only stabilizes the internal dynamics of the network but also fosters
a more robust feature representation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GraCE-VAE, a model combining variational autoencoders and graph neural networks, for causal disentanglement under non-i.i.d. settings with structured context, showing theoretical and empirical validity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on causal disentanglement under i.i.d. assumptions, limiting their effectiveness in scenarios involving structured, context-rich data like networks.

Method: The authors propose GraCE-VAE, which integrates discrepancy-based variational autoencoders with graph neural networks to simultaneously infer latent causal structures and intervention effects.

Result: Theoretical results confirm identifiability holds in non-i.i.d. settings. Empirical evaluations on three genetic perturbation datasets show GraCE-VAE outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: GraCE-VAE effectively leverages structured context for improved causal disentanglement, broadening the applicability of causal inference techniques to networked data settings.

Abstract: Causal disentanglement from soft interventions is identifiable under the
assumptions of linear interventional faithfulness and availability of both
observational and interventional data. Previous research has looked into this
problem from the perspective of i.i.d. data. Here, we develop a framework,
GraCE-VAE, for non-i.i.d. settings, in which structured context in the form of
network data is available. GraCE-VAE integrates discrepancy-based variational
autoencoders with graph neural networks to jointly recover the true latent
causal graph and intervention effects. We show that the theoretical results of
identifiability from i.i.d. data hold in our setup. We also empirically
evaluate GraCE-VAE against state-of-the-art baselines on three genetic
perturbation datasets to demonstrate the impact of leveraging structured
context for causal disentanglement.

*Zhao Wei,Chin Chun Ooi,Yew-Soon Ong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an efficient neural architecture search algorithm to optimize multi-objective architectures, reducing computational costs through adaptive approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural architecture search often demands high computational resources, particularly when dealing with multiple conflicting objectives.

Method: Utilization of an adaptive Co-Kriging-assisted multi-fidelity approach with clustering-based sampling and continuous encoding to reduce dimensions in search space.

Result: The proposed algorithm outperformed state-of-the-art methods across various benchmarks and application areas, including urban wind modeling and biomedical image segmentation.

Conclusion: The method efficiently identified principles for superior architecture design, achieving high performance at reduced computational costs.

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) is an attractive approach to automate the
design of optimized architectures but is constrained by high computational
budget, especially when optimizing for multiple, important conflicting
objectives. To address this, an adaptive Co-Kriging-assisted multi-fidelity
multi-objective NAS algorithm is proposed to further reduce the computational
cost of NAS by incorporating a clustering-based local multi-fidelity infill
sampling strategy, enabling efficient exploration of the search space for
faster convergence. This algorithm is further accelerated by the use of a novel
continuous encoding method to represent the connections of nodes in each cell
within a generalized cell-based U-Net backbone, thereby decreasing the search
dimension (number of variables). Results indicate that the proposed NAS
algorithm outperforms previously published state-of-the-art methods under
limited computational budget on three numerical benchmarks, a 2D Darcy flow
regression problem and a CHASE_DB1 biomedical image segmentation problem. The
proposed method is subsequently used to create a wind velocity regression model
with application in urban modelling, with the found model able to achieve good
prediction with less computational complexity. Further analysis revealed that
the NAS algorithm independently identified principles undergirding superior
U-Net architectures in other literature, such as the importance of allowing
each cell to incorporate information from prior cells.

*Long Jiang,Yang Yang,Ting Fong May Chui,Morgan Thornwell,Hoshin Vijai Gupta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified framework integrating process-based models and machine learning for ecohydrological modeling, aiming to reduce complexity and computational costs while improving accuracy and decision-making capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding ecohydrological processes is vital for sustainable environmental management, especially under pressures from climate change and human activities.

Method: A three-phase framework combining process-based models and ML is proposed, involving behavioral distillation (learning and simplification), structural distillation (integration into graph neural networks), and cognitive distillation (embedding expert reasoning).

Result: The framework reproduced process-model outputs, improved predictive accuracy, and supported scenario-based decision-making in a demonstration involving the Samish watershed.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a scalable, accurate, and transferable approach for advancing ecohydrological modeling, with broader implications beyond this domain.

Abstract: Simulating ecohydrological processes is essential for understanding complex
environmental systems and guiding sustainable management amid accelerating
climate change and human pressures. Process-based models provide physical
realism but can suffer from structural rigidity, high computational costs, and
complex calibration, while machine learning (ML) methods are efficient and
flexible yet often lack interpretability and transferability. We propose a
unified three-phase framework that integrates process-based models with ML and
progressively embeds them into artificial intelligence (AI) through knowledge
distillation. Phase I, behavioral distillation, enhances process models via
surrogate learning and model simplification to capture key dynamics at lower
computational cost. Phase II, structural distillation, reformulates process
equations as modular components within a graph neural network (GNN), enabling
multiscale representation and seamless integration with ML models. Phase III,
cognitive distillation, embeds expert reasoning and adaptive decision-making
into intelligent modeling agents using the Eyes-Brain-Hands-Mouth architecture.
Demonstrations for the Samish watershed highlight the framework's applicability
to ecohydrological modeling, showing that it can reproduce process-based model
outputs, improve predictive accuracy, and support scenario-based
decision-making. The framework offers a scalable and transferable pathway
toward next-generation intelligent ecohydrological modeling systems, with the
potential extension to other process-based domains.

*Jiacheng Shi,Haibin Wei,Jiang Wang,Xiaowei Xu,Longzhi Du,Taixu Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an innovative spatiotemporal learning model that uses two graphs (ongoing and global) for forecasting future order distributions in on-demand food delivery platforms, improving efficiency and forecasting performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle with capturing future order distributions due to randomness and time-series insensitivity in online delivery platforms. Improving this forecasting is essential for operational efficiency.

Method: The proposed approach employs ongoing and global graphs combined into a graph learning network framework featuring adaptive future graph learning and a cross-attention mechanism (ACA-Net) to enhance the modeling of order distributions.

Result: The use of the two graphs and ACA-Net framework substantially improves demand-supply pressure forecasting outcomes when tested in real-world production environments.

Conclusion: The innovative methodology offers an efficient and robust approach to logistical forecasting, demonstrating improved performance in practical applications compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: Logistical demand-supply forecasting that evaluates the alignment between
projected supply and anticipated demand, is essential for the efficiency and
quality of on-demand food delivery platforms and serves as a key indicator for
scheduling decisions. Future order distribution information, which reflects the
distribution of orders in on-demand food delivery, is crucial for the
performance of logistical demand-supply forecasting. Current studies utilize
spatial-temporal analysis methods to model future order distribution
information from serious time slices. However, learning future order
distribution in online delivery platform is a time-series-insensitive problem
with strong randomness. These approaches often struggle to effectively capture
this information while remaining efficient. This paper proposes an innovative
spatiotemporal learning model that utilizes only two graphs (ongoing and
global) to learn future order distribution information, achieving superior
performance compared to traditional spatial-temporal long-series methods. The
main contributions are as follows: (1) The introduction of ongoing and global
graphs in logistical demand-supply pressure forecasting compared to traditional
long time series significantly enhances forecasting performance. (2) An
innovative graph learning network framework using adaptive future graph
learning and innovative cross attention mechanism (ACA-Net) is proposed to
extract future order distribution information, effectively learning a robust
future graph that substantially improves logistical demand-supply pressure
forecasting outcomes. (3) The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated
in real-world production environments.

*Aref Einizade,Fragkiskos D. Malliaros,Jhony H. Giraldo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces second-order TPDEGs (So-TPDEGs) as a step beyond first-order methods to better handle data on product graphs, with improved information propagation and high-frequency preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for processing multidomain data on product graphs are limited; they either rely on discrete filtering or struggle to handle high-frequency signal damping, affecting their ability to model complex structures effectively.

Method: The authors propose second-order continuous product graph neural networks, leveraging separable cosine kernels for efficient spectral decomposition on Cartesian product graphs, and provide theoretical analyses of stability and over-smoothing.

Result: The approach improves the ability to process high-frequency signals and supports robust continuous graph learning through enhanced spectral properties and stability.

Conclusion: The findings lay a strong theoretical foundation for advancing continuous-method graph learning to model complex, multidomain data more effectively.

Abstract: Processing data that lies on multiple interacting (product) graphs is
increasingly important in practical applications, yet existing methods are
mostly restricted to discrete graph filtering. Tensorial partial differential
equations on graphs (TPDEGs) offer a principled framework for modeling such
multidomain data in a continuous setting. However, current continuous
approaches are limited to first-order derivatives, which tend to dampen
high-frequency signals and slow down information propagation. This makes these
TPDEGs-based approaches less effective for capturing complex, multi-scale, and
heterophilic structures. In this paper, we introduce second-order TPDEGs
(So-TPDEGs) and propose the first theoretically grounded framework for
second-order continuous product graph neural networks. Our approach leverages
the separability of cosine kernels in Cartesian product graphs to implement
efficient spectral decomposition, while naturally preserving high-frequency
information. We provide rigorous theoretical analyses of stability under graph
perturbations and over-smoothing behavior regarding spectral properties. Our
theoretical results establish a robust foundation for advancing continuous
graph learning across multiple practical domains.

### [643] [Genetic Programming with Model Driven Dimension Repair for Learning Interpretable Appointment Scheduling Rules](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02034)
*Huan Zhang,Yang Wang,Ya-Hui Jia,Yi Mei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel dimensionally aware genetic programming (GP) algorithm with a dimension repair mechanism for evolving appointment rules (ARs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing effective and interpretable appointment rules is challenging due to the lack of dimensional consistency in traditional genetic programming approaches.

Method: The authors introduce a GP algorithm with a dimension repair procedure, using mixed-integer linear programming to ensure dimensional consistency while maintaining AR structure integrity.

Result: Experiments in simulated clinics show the proposed method outperforms manually designed and state-of-the-art GP methods in both performance and dimensional consistency.

Conclusion: The proposed GP algorithm generates effective and interpretable ARs by combining performance optimization with dimensional consistency, offering a practical solution for healthcare appointment scheduling.

Abstract: Appointment scheduling is a great challenge in healthcare operations
management. Appointment rules (AR) provide medical practitioners with a simple
yet effective tool to determine patient appointment times. Genetic programming
(GP) can be used to evolve ARs. However, directly applying GP to design ARs may
lead to rules that are difficult for end-users to interpret and trust. A key
reason is that GP is unaware of the dimensional consistency, which ensures that
the evolved rules align with users' domain knowledge and intuitive
understanding. In this paper, we develop a new dimensionally aware GP algorithm
with dimension repair to evolve ARs with dimensional consistency and high
performance. A key innovation of our method is the dimension repair procedure,
which optimizes the dimensional consistency of an expression tree while
minimizing structural changes and ensuring that its output dimension meets the
problem's requirements. We formulate the task as a mixed-integer linear
programming model that can be efficiently solved using common mathematical
programming methods. With the support of the dimension repair procedure, our
method can explore a wider range of AR structures by temporarily breaking the
dimensional consistency of individuals, and then restoring it without altering
their overall structure, thereby identifying individuals with greater potential
advantages. We evaluated the proposed method in a comprehensive set of
simulated clinics. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach
managed to evolve high-quality ARs that significantly outperform not only the
manually designed ARs but also existing state-of-the-art dimensionally aware GP
methods in terms of both objective values and dimensional consistency. In
addition, we analyzed the semantics of the evolved ARs, providing insight into
the design of more effective and interpretable ARs.

### [644] [Privacy-Utility Trade-off in Data Publication: A Bilevel Optimization Framework with Curvature-Guided Perturbation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02048)
*Yi Yin,Guangquan Zhang,Hua Zuo,Jie Lu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel bilevel optimization framework to generate private datasets that enhance data privacy while retaining data utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To balance the critical trade-off between ensuring data privacy and maintaining data utility when sharing datasets for machine learning.

Method: A bilevel optimization framework is proposed, where the upper-level focuses on data utility via a discriminator guiding sample generation, and the lower-level uses local extrinsic curvature on data manifolds to target privacy vulnerabilities and reduce susceptibility to membership inference attacks.

Result: The framework improves resistance to membership inference attacks and outperforms current methods in generating high-quality and diverse samples.

Conclusion: The method achieves a synergistic balance of privacy and utility, making it a more effective approach to private dataset publication compared to existing techniques.

Abstract: Machine learning models require datasets for effective training, but directly
sharing raw data poses significant privacy risk such as membership inference
attacks (MIA). To mitigate the risk, privacy-preserving techniques such as data
perturbation, generalization, and synthetic data generation are commonly
utilized. However, these methods often degrade data accuracy, specificity, and
diversity, limiting the performance of downstream tasks and thus reducing data
utility. Therefore, striking an optimal balance between privacy preservation
and data utility remains a critical challenge.
  To address this issue, we introduce a novel bilevel optimization framework
for the publication of private datasets, where the upper-level task focuses on
data utility and the lower-level task focuses on data privacy. In the
upper-level task, a discriminator guides the generation process to ensure that
perturbed latent variables are mapped to high-quality samples, maintaining
fidelity for downstream tasks. In the lower-level task, our framework employs
local extrinsic curvature on the data manifold as a quantitative measure of
individual vulnerability to MIA, providing a geometric foundation for targeted
privacy protection. By perturbing samples toward low-curvature regions, our
method effectively suppresses distinctive feature combinations that are
vulnerable to MIA. Through alternating optimization of both objectives, we
achieve a synergistic balance between privacy and utility. Extensive
experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method not only enhances
resistance to MIA in downstream tasks but also surpasses existing methods in
terms of sample quality and diversity.

TL;DR: LUCIE-3D is a computationally efficient climate emulator using machine learning to model 3D atmospheric dynamics and predict climate change impacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for computationally efficient models to understand vertical atmospheric phenomena, respond to climate change forcings, and explore coupled climate dynamics.

Method: Built upon a Spherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO) trained on 30 years of ERA5 reanalysis data, the model incorporates CO2 forcings and optionally integrates prescribed sea surface temperatures for coupled simulations.

Result: Successfully captures long-term climate signals like warming and stratospheric cooling, key dynamical processes, and extreme event statistics while maintaining efficiency and reliability.

Conclusion: LUCIE-3D is a valuable tool for climate experimentation and studies, applicable to diverse research areas including paleoclimate exploration and Earth system emulation.

Abstract: We introduce LUCIE-3D, a lightweight three-dimensional climate emulator
designed to capture the vertical structure of the atmosphere, respond to
climate change forcings, and maintain computational efficiency with long-term
stability. Building on the original LUCIE-2D framework, LUCIE-3D employs a
Spherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO) backbone and is trained on 30 years of
ERA5 reanalysis data spanning eight vertical {\sigma}-levels. The model
incorporates atmospheric CO2 as a forcing variable and optionally integrates
prescribed sea surface temperature (SST) to simulate coupled ocean--atmosphere
dynamics. Results demonstrate that LUCIE-3D successfully reproduces
climatological means, variability, and long-term climate change signals,
including surface warming and stratospheric cooling under increasing CO2
concentrations. The model further captures key dynamical processes such as
equatorial Kelvin waves, the Madden--Julian Oscillation, and annular modes,
while showing credible behavior in the statistics of extreme events. Despite
requiring longer training than its 2D predecessor, LUCIE-3D remains efficient,
training in under five hours on four GPUs. Its combination of stability,
physical consistency, and accessibility makes it a valuable tool for rapid
experimentation, ablation studies, and the exploration of coupled climate
dynamics, with potential applications extending to paleoclimate research and
future Earth system emulation.

*Srinivas Anumasa,Barath Chandran. C,Tingting Chen,Dianbo Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method for generative modeling in sparse, high-dimensional domains like proteins by using a data-dependent noise scale estimation via KDE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models for generative purposes fail to account for the heterogeneous sparsity in datasets, particularly in domains such as proteins.

Method: A Data-Dependent Smoothing Walk-Jump framework is proposed, where kernel density estimation (KDE) is used to estimate noise scale values for each data point to train a score model.

Result: The proposed method leads to consistent improvements across several evaluation metrics in handling sparse and high-dimensional data.

Conclusion: Incorporating local data geometry into generative models significantly improves performance in handling heterogeneous and sparse datasets like proteins.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models by
learning to iteratively reverse the noising process. Their ability to generate
high-quality samples has extended beyond high-dimensional image data to other
complex domains such as proteins, where data distributions are typically sparse
and unevenly spread. Importantly, the sparsity itself is uneven. Empirically,
we observed that while a small fraction of samples lie in dense clusters, the
majority occupy regions of varying sparsity across the data space. Existing
approaches largely ignore this data-dependent variability. In this work, we
introduce a Data-Dependent Smoothing Walk-Jump framework that employs kernel
density estimation (KDE) as a preprocessing step to estimate the noise scale
$\sigma$ for each data point, followed by training a score model with these
data-dependent $\sigma$ values. By incorporating local data geometry into the
denoising process, our method accounts for the heterogeneous distribution of
protein data. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach yields
consistent improvements across multiple metrics, highlighting the importance of
data-aware sigma prediction for generative modeling in sparse, high-dimensional
settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces ABEX-RAT, a framework to enhance occupational accident report classification using generative data augmentation and adversarial training. It achieves a state-of-the-art macro-F1 score of 90.32% on the OSHA dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of severe class imbalance in occupational accident reports, which hinder the performance of analytical models, particularly for rare yet critical incident types.

Method: The method includes a two-step ABEX pipeline for generative data augmentation, combining abstractive summarization with expansive synthetic sample creation for underrepresented classes, followed by lightweight classifier training using random adversarial training (RAT) to enhance robustness.

Result: The framework demonstrated an improvement in classification performance on the OSHA dataset, achieving a macro-F1 score of 90.32%, surpassing prior state-of-the-art methods and large-model baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed ABEX-RAT framework is a highly efficient and effective alternative to brute-force fine-tuning for addressing specialized, imbalanced classification tasks, validating its utility in workplace safety analysis.

Abstract: The automatic classification of occupational accident reports is a critical
research area for enhancing workplace safety and enabling large-scale risk
analysis. However, the severe class imbalance inherent in these real-world
datasets often compromises the performance of analytical models, particularly
for rare but severe incident types, hindering the development of reliable
automated systems. To address this challenge, we propose ABEX-RAT, a novel and
efficient framework that synergizes generative data augmentation with robust
adversarial training. Our approach first employs a twostep
abstractive-expansive (ABEX) pipeline, which leverages a large language model
to distill core incident semantics and then uses a generative model to create
diverse, highquality synthetic samples for underrepresented classes.
Subsequently, a lightweight classifier is trained on the augmented data using a
computationally efficient random adversarial training (RAT) protocol, which
stochastically applies perturbations to enhance model generalization and
robustness without significant overhead. Experimental results on the public
OSHA dataset demonstrate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art
performance, reaching a macro-F1 score of 90.32% and significantly
outperforming previous SOTA and fine-tuned large model baselines. Our work
validates that this synergistic strategy is a highly effective and efficient
alternative to brute-force fine-tuning for specialized, imbalanced
classification tasks. The code is publicly available

*Long Shi,Yunshan Ye,Wenjie Wang,Tao Lei,Yu Zhao,Gang Kou,Badong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces CIML, a multi-view learning framework that incorporates both common and unique information to enhance downstream task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of multi-view learning methods that rely on the assumption of multi-view redundancy, ignoring the predictive potential of unique information in each view.

Method: CIML extracts common information using the Gacs-Korner method and compresses it using the Information Bottleneck principle. For unique information, it employs IB to compress and minimize dependencies among representations.

Result: The experimental results show that CIML outperforms several state-of-the-art multi-view learning methods in downstream tasks.

Conclusion: CIML proves to be an effective framework by leveraging both common and unique information, providing a theory-backed and experimentally validated approach for multi-view learning.

Abstract: Information theory has inspired numerous advancements in multi-view learning.
Most multi-view methods incorporating information-theoretic principles rely an
assumption called multi-view redundancy which states that common information
between views is necessary and sufficient for down-stream tasks. This
assumption emphasizes the importance of common information for prediction, but
inherently ignores the potential of unique information in each view that could
be predictive to the task. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive
information-theoretic multi-view learning framework named CIML, which discards
the assumption of multi-view redundancy. Specifically, CIML considers the
potential predictive capabilities of both common and unique information based
on information theory. First, the common representation learning maximizes
Gacs-Korner common information to extract shared features and then compresses
this information to learn task-relevant representations based on the
Information Bottleneck (IB). For unique representation learning, IB is employed
to achieve the most compressed unique representation for each view while
simultaneously minimizing the mutual information between unique and common
representations, as well as among different unique representations.
Importantly, we theoretically prove that the learned joint representation is
predictively sufficient for the downstream task. Extensive experimental results
have demonstrated the superiority of our model over several state-of-art
methods. The code is released on CIML.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a Jensen-Shannon divergence-based method to merge models trained on different tasks, mitigating task interference and maintaining strong performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address task interference challenges in multi-task learning as the number of tasks and fine-tuned models increases.

Method: Introduce a model-merging method guided by Jensen-Shannon divergence, avoiding the need for additional labeled data and balancing task importance.

Result: Achieved robust performance across multiple tasks and outperformed prior methods, especially as task numbers grow.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively merges multi-task models with scalable performance, overcoming task interference issues.

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) is often achieved by merging datasets before
fine-tuning, but the growing availability of fine-tuned models has led to new
approaches such as model merging via task arithmetic. A major challenge in this
setting is task interference, which worsens as the number of tasks increases.
We propose a method that merges models trained on different tasks into a single
model, maintaining strong performance across all tasks. Our approach leverages
Jensen-Shannon divergence to guide the merging process without requiring
additional labelled data, and automatically balances task importance. Unlike
existing methods, our approach remains robust as the number of tasks grows and
consistently outperforms prior work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing malware analysis methods fail to capture the hierarchical relationship between high-level functional interactions and low-level instructions, leading to ineffective detectors against obfuscation and evolving malware.

Method: Developed HiGraph, a two-level hierarchical graph dataset preserving both FCG and CFG structures, to better model the structural semantics of software.

Result: The dataset reveals distinctive structural differences between benign and malicious software, demonstrating its potential for building robust, resilient detectors.

Conclusion: HiGraph serves as a foundational benchmark and dataset resource for advancing malware analysis and is publicly available for further research.

Abstract: The advancement of graph-based malware analysis is critically limited by the
absence of large-scale datasets that capture the inherent hierarchical
structure of software. Existing methods often oversimplify programs into single
level graphs, failing to model the crucial semantic relationship between
high-level functional interactions and low-level instruction logic. To bridge
this gap, we introduce \dataset, the largest public hierarchical graph dataset
for malware analysis, comprising over \textbf{200M} Control Flow Graphs (CFGs)
nested within \textbf{595K} Function Call Graphs (FCGs). This two-level
representation preserves structural semantics essential for building robust
detectors resilient to code obfuscation and malware evolution. We demonstrate
HiGraph's utility through a large-scale analysis that reveals distinct
structural properties of benign and malicious software, establishing it as a
foundational benchmark for the community. The dataset and tools are publicly
available at https://higraph.org.

*Chanakya Varude,Jay Chaudhary,Siddharth Kaushik,Prasanna Chaporkar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies a new bandit problem focused on selecting arms based on their relation to a threshold rather than merely finding the highest reward.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address real-world applications like communication networks, clinical trials, and recommendation systems, where decisions often involve thresholds rather than purely maximizing rewards.

Method: The paper analyzes variants of the threshold-based bandit problem using asymptotic regret lower bounds and proposes algorithms validated by Monte Carlo simulations.

Result: The proposed algorithms demonstrate optimal performance, and the analysis shows asymptotic regret depends only on arms adjacent to the threshold.

Conclusion: The study extends classical multi-armed bandit theory by introducing threshold constraints, providing more efficient decision-making solutions for practical applications.

Abstract: In multi-armed bandit problems, the typical goal is to identify the arm with
the highest reward. This paper explores a threshold-based bandit problem,
aiming to select an arm based on its relation to a prescribed threshold \(\tau
\). We study variants where the optimal arm is the first above \(\tau\), the
\(k^{th}\) arm above or below it, or the closest to it, under a monotonic
structure of arm means. We derive asymptotic regret lower bounds, showing
dependence only on arms adjacent to \(\tau\). Motivated by applications in
communication networks (CQI allocation), clinical dosing, energy management,
recommendation systems, and more. We propose algorithms with optimality
validated through Monte Carlo simulations. Our work extends classical bandit
theory with threshold constraints for efficient decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VPR methods face challenges like high computational demands and limited cross-domain transferability when fine-tuned.

Method: The authors propose a TTS framework leveraging structured prompts and Uncertainty-Aware Self-Consistency (UASC) to utilize MLLMs' vision-language alignment for similarity scoring, bypassing the need for two-stage processing.

Result: Experimental findings show improved VPR performance across various domains with up to 210× computational efficiency gains.

Conclusion: The approach achieves enhanced generalization capabilities and computational efficiency in VPR without additional training requirements.

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) has evolved from handcrafted descriptors to
deep learning approaches, yet significant challenges remain. Current
approaches, including Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs), enhance semantic understanding but suffer from high
computational overhead and limited cross-domain transferability when
fine-tuned. To address these limitations, we propose a novel zero-shot
framework employing Test-Time Scaling (TTS) that leverages MLLMs'
vision-language alignment capabilities through Guidance-based methods for
direct similarity scoring. Our approach eliminates two-stage processing by
employing structured prompts that generate length-controllable JSON outputs.
The TTS framework with Uncertainty-Aware Self-Consistency (UASC) enables
real-time adaptation without additional training costs, achieving superior
generalization across diverse environments. Experimental results demonstrate
significant improvements in cross-domain VPR performance with up to 210$\times$

### [653] [Simulating classification models to evaluate Predict-Then-Optimize methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02191)
*Pieter Smet*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how machine learning prediction accuracy impacts optimization solution quality and proposes a new algorithm for simulating predictions from multiclass classifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the impact of prediction errors on solution quality in optimization problems is critical but often lacks empirical validation, especially in constrained scenarios.

Method: The authors develop an algorithm to simulate multiclass classifier predictions and use it to study a Predict-Then-Optimize framework applied to a machine scheduling problem.

Result: Classifier performance was simulated with reasonable accuracy, despite variability. Experiments revealed a complex relationship between prediction error and solution quality.

Conclusion: Predict-Then-Optimize frameworks require careful evaluation as the relationship between prediction accuracy and optimization quality is non-linear and context-dependent.

Abstract: Uncertainty in optimization is often represented as stochastic parameters in
the optimization model. In Predict-Then-Optimize approaches, predictions of a
machine learning model are used as values for such parameters, effectively
transforming the stochastic optimization problem into a deterministic one. This
two-stage framework is built on the assumption that more accurate predictions
result in solutions that are closer to the actual optimal solution. However,
providing evidence for this assumption in the context of complex, constrained
optimization problems is challenging and often overlooked in the literature.
Simulating predictions of machine learning models offers a way to
(experimentally) analyze how prediction error impacts solution quality without
the need to train real models. Complementing an algorithm from the literature
for simulating binary classification, we introduce a new algorithm for
simulating predictions of multiclass classifiers. We conduct a computational
study to evaluate the performance of these algorithms, and show that classifier
performance can be simulated with reasonable accuracy, although some
variability is observed. Additionally, we apply these algorithms to assess the
performance of a Predict-Then-Optimize algorithm for a machine scheduling
problem. The experiments demonstrate that the relationship between prediction
error and how close solutions are to the actual optimum is non-trivial,
highlighting important considerations for the design and evaluation of
decision-making systems based on machine learning predictions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel dynamic verification framework to improve the healthcare application of LLMs beyond static benchmarks, using Baichuan-M2, a 32B-parameter model, achieving state-of-the-art results on HealthBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between static benchmarks and real-world clinical utility of LLMs due to traditional tests' inability to replicate interactive medical scenarios.

Method: Implementation of a dynamic verification framework with a Patient Simulator and a Clinical Rubrics Generator, along with training Baichuan-M2 through a multi-stage reinforcement learning strategy using the GRPO algorithm.

Result: Baichuan-M2 achieved top-tier performance on HealthBench, surpassing most open-source and some advanced closed-source models, and set a new benchmark in performance-parameter trade-off.

Conclusion: Dynamic verifier systems like the one proposed are essential for advancing LLMs in effective clinical deployments, bridging the gap between static performance and real-world utility.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance in conversational and reasoning
capabilities, their practical application in healthcare has become a critical
research focus. However, there is a notable gap between the performance of
medical LLMs on static benchmarks such as USMLE and their utility in real-world
clinical decision-making. This discrepancy arises because traditional exams
fail to capture the dynamic, interactive nature of medical consultations. To
address this challenge, we introduce a novel dynamic verification framework
that moves beyond static answer verifier, establishing a large-scale,
high-fidelity interactive reinforcement learning system. Our framework
comprises two key components: a Patient Simulator that creates realistic
clinical environments using de-identified medical records, and a Clinical
Rubrics Generator that dynamically produces multi-dimensional evaluation
metrics. Building on this foundation, we develop Baichuan-M2, a 32B-parameter
medical augmented reasoning model trained through a multi-stage reinforcement
learning strategy with an improved Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
algorithm. Evaluated on HealthBench, Baichuan-M2 outperforms all other
open-source models and most advanced closed-source counterparts, achieving a
score above 32 on the challenging HealthBench Hard benchmark-previously
exceeded only by GPT-5. Our work demonstrates that robust dynamic verifier
system is essential for aligning LLM capabilities with practical clinical
applications, establishing a new Pareto front in the performance-parameter
trade-off for medical AI deployment.

*Binqing Wu,Jianlong Huang,Zongjiang Shang,Ling Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ST-Hyper improves multivariate time series forecasting by modeling high-order dependencies across multiple spatial-temporal scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to capture dependencies across combined spatial and temporal scales.

Method: ST-Hyper leverages a Spatial-Temporal Pyramid Modeling module and Adaptive Hypergraph Modeling module with tri-phase hypergraph propagation to address multi-scale spatial-temporal dynamics.

Result: Experiments on six real-world datasets show ST-Hyper achieves state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy, reducing MAE by 3.8% (long-term) and 6.8% (short-term) compared to baselines.

Conclusion: ST-Hyper offers robust forecasting improvements by introducing advanced spatial-temporal scale modeling mechanisms.

Abstract: In multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting, many deep learning based
methods have been proposed for modeling dependencies at multiple spatial
(inter-variate) or temporal (intra-variate) scales. However, existing methods
may fail to model dependencies across multiple spatial-temporal scales
(ST-scales, i.e., scales that jointly consider spatial and temporal scopes). In
this work, we propose ST-Hyper to model the high-order dependencies across
multiple ST-scales through adaptive hypergraph modeling. Specifically, we
introduce a Spatial-Temporal Pyramid Modeling (STPM) module to extract features
at multiple ST-scales. Furthermore, we introduce an Adaptive Hypergraph
Modeling (AHM) module that learns a sparse hypergraph to capture robust
high-order dependencies among features. In addition, we interact with these
features through tri-phase hypergraph propagation, which can comprehensively
capture multi-scale spatial-temporal dynamics. Experimental results on six
real-world MTS datasets demonstrate that ST-Hyper achieves the state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming the best baselines with an average MAE reduction of
3.8\% and 6.8\% for long-term and short-term forecasting, respectively.

### [656] [Evaluating Cumulative Spectral Gradient as a Complexity Measure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02399)
*Haji Gul,Abdul Ghani Naim,Ajaz Ahmad Bhat*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper questions the reliability of the Cumulative Spectral Gradient (CSG) as a dataset complexity metric for knowledge graph link prediction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for robust methods to evaluate and compare the complexity of datasets in knowledge graph link predictions, where earlier proposed metrics like CSG may have limitations.

Method: The authors rigorously analyze the CSG metric's sensitivity to parameters like Monte Carlo sampled points (M) and nearest neighbors (K) across benchmarks for multi-class knowledge graph tail prediction tasks.

Result: Experiments showed that CSG is highly sensitive to parameter settings, does not inherently scale with the number of target classes, and has weak correlation with standard performance metrics like MRR.

Conclusion: CSG's claimed generalization predictive power and stability are unreliable in link prediction scenarios, underscoring the need for new complexity measures for knowledge graphs.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of dataset complexity is crucial for evaluating and
comparing link prediction models for knowledge graphs (KGs). The Cumulative
Spectral Gradient (CSG) metric derived from probabilistic divergence between
classes within a spectral clustering framework was proposed as a dataset
complexity measure that (1) naturally scales with the number of classes and (2)
correlates strongly with downstream classification performance. In this work,
we rigorously assess CSG behavior on standard knowledge graph link prediction
benchmarks a multi class tail prediction task, using two key parameters
governing its computation, M, the number of Monte Carlo sampled points per
class, and K, the number of nearest neighbors in the embedding space. Contrary
to the original claims, we find that (1) CSG is highly sensitive to the choice
of K and therefore does not inherently scale with the number of target classes,
and (2) CSG values exhibit weak or no correlation with established performance
metrics such as mean reciprocal rank (MRR). Through experiments on FB15k 237,
WN18RR, and other standard datasets, we demonstrate that CSG purported
stability and generalization predictive power break down in link prediction
settings. Our results highlight the need for more robust, classifier agnostic
complexity measures in KG link prediction evaluation.

*Yigal Koifman,Erez Koifman,Eran Iceland,Ariel Barel,Alfred M. Bruckstein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents VariAntNet, a deep learning-based decentralized control model for swarm robotics in disaster scenarios, showing significant improvement in task execution efficiency over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for a swarm of simple robotic agents to work cohesively and execute tasks effectively in disaster-response scenarios, despite their limited sensing and lack of inter-agent communication.

Method: The authors developed VariAntNet, which extracts geometric features from local observations and uses a novel loss function based on the visibility graph Laplacian matrix. This promotes swarm cohesion and task efficiency.

Result: VariAntNet outperformed existing analytical solutions by doubling the convergence rate and maintaining higher swarm connectivity across varying sizes, even at the expense of potential minor agent losses.

Conclusion: VariAntNet offers a faster and more practical solution for time-critical scenarios, making it suited for applications such as firefighting and emergency response by balancing cohesion and speed.

Abstract: A simple multi-agent system can be effectively utilized in disaster response
applications, such as firefighting. Such a swarm is required to operate in
complex environments with limited local sensing and no reliable inter-agent
communication or centralized control. These simple robotic agents, also known
as Ant Robots, are defined as anonymous agents that possess limited sensing
capabilities, lack a shared coordinate system, and do not communicate
explicitly with one another. A key challenge for simple swarms lies in
maintaining cohesion and avoiding fragmentation despite limited-range sensing.
Recent advances in machine learning offer effective solutions to some of the
classical decentralized control challenges. We propose VariAntNet, a deep
learning-based decentralized control model designed to facilitate agent
swarming and collaborative task execution. VariAntNet includes geometric
features extraction from unordered, variable-sized local observations. It
incorporates a neural network architecture trained with a novel,
differentiable, multi-objective, mathematically justified loss function that
promotes swarm cohesiveness by utilizing the properties of the visibility graph
Laplacian matrix. VariAntNet is demonstrated on the fundamental multi-agent
gathering task, where agents with bearing-only and limited-range sensing must
gather at some location. VariAntNet significantly outperforms an existing
analytical solution, achieving more than double the convergence rate while
maintaining high swarm connectivity across varying swarm sizes. While the
analytical solution guarantees cohesion, it is often too slow in practice. In
time-critical scenarios, such as emergency response operations where lives are
at risk, slower analytical methods are impractical and justify the loss of some
agents within the swarm. This paper presents and analyzes this trade-off in
detail.

*Shijie Wang,Li Zhang,Xinyan Liang,Yuhua Qian,Shen Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a proactive multimodal learning strategy called Unidirectional Dynamic Interaction (UDI), which avoids joint loss and optimally balances modality interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal learning strategies based on joint loss suffer from modality imbalance, where stronger modalities dominate weaker ones, limiting effective interaction and utilization of individual modality information.

Method: UDI uses a sequential training approach, leveraging unsupervised loss and dynamic adjustment to ensure optimal contribution and interaction between modalities, starting with an anchor modality.

Result: UDI outperformed existing methods in handling modality imbalance, improving model performance in multimodal learning tasks.

Conclusion: The study shows UDI is a superior method for addressing modality imbalance in multimodal learning, fostering cross-modal interaction and enhancing overall performance.

Abstract: Multimodal learning typically utilizes multimodal joint loss to integrate
different modalities and enhance model performance. However, this joint
learning strategy can induce modality imbalance, where strong modalities
overwhelm weaker ones and limit exploitation of individual information from
each modality and the inter-modality interaction information.Existing
strategies such as dynamic loss weighting, auxiliary objectives and gradient
modulation mitigate modality imbalance based on joint loss. These methods
remain fundamentally reactive, detecting and correcting imbalance after it
arises, while leaving the competitive nature of the joint loss untouched. This
limitation drives us to explore a new strategy for multimodal imbalance
learning that does not rely on the joint loss, enabling more effective
interactions between modalities and better utilization of information from
individual modalities and their interactions. In this paper, we introduce
Unidirectional Dynamic Interaction (UDI), a novel strategy that abandons the
conventional joint loss in favor of a proactive, sequential training scheme.
UDI first trains the anchor modality to convergence, then uses its learned
representations to guide the other modality via unsupervised loss. Furthermore,
the dynamic adjustment of modality interactions allows the model to adapt to
the task at hand, ensuring that each modality contributes optimally. By
decoupling modality optimization and enabling directed information flow, UDI
prevents domination by any single modality and fosters effective cross-modal
feature learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that UDI outperforms
existing methods in handling modality imbalance, leading to performance
improvement in multimodal learning tasks.

TL;DR: This study introduces a framework for online decision-making with sequence-based predictions, proposing the AdaSwitch meta-algorithm to balance performance with varying prediction accuracies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of decision-making in multi-period online settings with unreliable sequence-based predictions, aiming to develop strategies that perform well under both accurate and inaccurate predictions.

Method: The authors propose a bounded-influence framework and the AdaSwitch meta-algorithm, which leverage predictions to optimize decisions while ensuring classical competitive ratios are met when predictions are inaccurate.

Result: The framework and AdaSwitch algorithm exhibit strong applicability and flexibility across various problems like lead-time quotation, the k-server problem, and resource allocation.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers a robust solution for learning-augmented online decision-making problems, bridging the gap between prediction accuracy and decision performance.

Abstract: We study a class of multi-period online decision-making problems with
sequence-based predictions, which may be generated by machine learning models
but whose accuracy is not guaranteed. In each period, the decision-maker
observes the realized request and must take an irrevocable action that yields a
reward or incurs a cost, without knowledge of future arrivals. We introduce a
bounded-influence framework, in which past decisions and requests exert only
limited impact on the future optimal reward. Within this framework, we propose
the AdaSwitch meta-algorithm, which exploits predictions to attain performance
close to the offline benchmark when predictions are accurate, while preserving
classical competitive-ratio guarantees under highly inaccurate predictions. Our
framework and meta-algorithm apply to diverse settings, including lead-time
quotation in processing systems, the $k$-server problem, and online allocation
of reusable resources. These applications illustrate the flexibility and broad
applicability of our approach to learning-augmented online decision-making.

*Aleksi Avela,Pauliina Ilmonen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel Markov chain-based synthetic oversampling method for imbalanced text data classification and shows it performs well compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imbalanced data is a prevalent issue in text classification, where observations and misclassification costs are unevenly distributed among classes, creating challenges in accurately classifying minority categories.

Method: The authors propose a Markov chain-based synthetic oversampling method that estimates transition probabilities from both minority and majority classes to expand the feature space of the minority class during oversampling.

Result: The method was thoroughly evaluated against other popular oversampling techniques and performed competitively, especially in datasets with severe class imbalance.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides an effective solution for generating synthetic data in imbalanced text classification tasks, addressing distinctive challenges in text domains and improving performance under severe imbalance scenarios.

Abstract: Text classification is the task of automatically assigning text documents
correct labels from a predefined set of categories. In real-life (text)
classification tasks, observations and misclassification costs are often
unevenly distributed between the classes - known as the problem of imbalanced
data. Synthetic oversampling is a popular approach to imbalanced
classification. The idea is to generate synthetic observations in the minority
class to balance the classes in the training set. Many general-purpose
oversampling methods can be applied to text data; however, imbalanced text data
poses a number of distinctive difficulties that stem from the unique nature of
text compared to other domains. One such factor is that when the sample size of
text increases, the sample vocabulary (i.e., feature space) is likely to grow
as well. We introduce a novel Markov chain based text oversampling method. The
transition probabilities are estimated from the minority class but also partly
from the majority class, thus allowing the minority feature space to expand in
oversampling. We evaluate our approach against prominent oversampling methods
and show that our approach is able to produce highly competitive results
against the other methods in several real data examples, especially when the
imbalance is severe.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional guardian models are limited to detecting predefined harm categories, which may not suit varying application needs.

Method: The authors propose dynamic guardian models that incorporate user-defined policies for policy-violation detection and offer chain-of-thought reasoning.

Result: Dynamic models are as accurate as static models for predefined harm categories and perform comparably to reasoning models for free-form policies while being time-efficient.

Conclusion: Dynamic guardian models enhance chatbot supervision by being adaptable to diverse application domains with efficient and accurate policy enforcement.

Abstract: Guardian models are used to supervise and moderate the outputs of user-facing
chatbots, enforcing guardrails and detecting bad behaviors. Standard guardian
models like LlamaGuard detect predefined, static categories of harms. We
propose dynamic guardian models that evaluate text based on user-defined
policies, making them useful for different application domains that are not
addressed by standard guardian models. Our dynamic guardian models can be used
for fast detection of policy violations or with chain-of-thought reasoning that
articulates and justifies the model outputs. Our dynamic guardian models match
static models in detection accuracy for static harm categories while
identifying violations of free-form policies with accuracy comparable to
frontier reasoning models in a fraction of the time.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address suboptimal distribution modeling and the mismatch between training and evaluation metrics in probabilistic time series forecasting.

Method: The proposed RDIT framework merges point estimation with residual-based conditional diffusion and uses a bidirectional Mamba network, aiming to align the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) optimally.

Result: RDIT demonstrates superior performance by achieving lower CRPS, faster inference, and better coverage compared to existing methods, tested on eight diverse multivariate datasets.

Conclusion: RDIT establishes a novel way to enhance probabilistic time series forecasting with improved predictive quality, making it an effective tool for uncertainty-aware predictions.

Abstract: Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting (PTSF) plays a critical role in domains
requiring accurate and uncertainty-aware predictions for decision-making.
However, existing methods offer suboptimal distribution modeling and suffer
from a mismatch between training and evaluation metrics. Surprisingly, we found
that augmenting a strong point estimator with a zero-mean Gaussian, whose
standard deviation matches its training error, can yield state-of-the-art
performance in PTSF. In this work, we propose RDIT, a plug-and-play framework
that combines point estimation and residual-based conditional diffusion with a
bidirectional Mamba network. We theoretically prove that the Continuous Ranked
Probability Score (CRPS) can be minimized by adjusting to an optimal standard
deviation and then derive algorithms to achieve distribution matching.
Evaluations on eight multivariate datasets across varied forecasting horizons
demonstrate that RDIT achieves lower CRPS, rapid inference, and improved
coverage compared to strong baselines.

TL;DR: The paper investigates how Fisher information is processed in ANNs used for parameter estimation and presents a method to track this flow as well as a stopping criterion for training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) handle and transmit information relevant to parameter estimation in physical systems.

Method: A method to monitor the flow of Fisher information from input to output layers in an ANN during parameter estimation tasks, and using this flow to define an optimal stopping criterion for training.

Result: Optimal ANN performance occurs when Fisher information transmission is maximized. Overtraining results in loss of Fisher information, and their method eliminates reliance on a separate validation dataset.

Conclusion: Their approach enables better training of ANNs in parameter estimation tasks by emphasizing optimal Fisher information transmission, and it is demonstrated to work effectively in realistic physical scenarios.

Abstract: The estimation of continuous parameters from measured data plays a central
role in many fields of physics. A key tool in understanding and improving such
estimation processes is the concept of Fisher information, which quantifies how
information about unknown parameters propagates through a physical system and
determines the ultimate limits of precision. With Artificial Neural Networks
(ANNs) gradually becoming an integral part of many measurement systems, it is
essential to understand how they process and transmit parameter-relevant
information internally. Here, we present a method to monitor the flow of Fisher
information through an ANN performing a parameter estimation task, tracking it
from the input to the output layer. We show that optimal estimation performance
corresponds to the maximal transmission of Fisher information, and that
training beyond this point results in information loss due to overfitting. This
provides a model-free stopping criterion for network training-eliminating the
need for a separate validation dataset. To demonstrate the practical relevance
of our approach, we apply it to a network trained on data from an imaging
experiment, highlighting its effectiveness in a realistic physical setting.

Motivation: Large language models involve billions of parameters that require efficient memory management to reduce system requirements and improve performance.

Method: The authors formulated a paging problem tailored to managing experts in Mixture-of-Experts architectures, derived theoretical lower bounds for algorithms, and developed an extended layer-based LRU method.

Conclusion: The work provides a tailored memory management solution for LLMs with Mixture-of-Experts architectures, achieving better cache efficiency through theoretical insights and practical improvements.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a variety of tasks. One of the main challenges towards the successful
deployment of LLMs is memory management, since they typically involve billions
of parameters. To this end, architectures based on Mixture-of-Experts have been
proposed, which aim to reduce the size of the parameters that are activated
when producing a token. This raises the equally critical issue of efficiently
managing the limited cache of the system, in that frequently used experts
should be stored in the fast cache rather than in the slower secondary memory.
  In this work, we introduce and study a new paging problem that models expert
management optimization. Our formulation captures both the layered architecture
of LLMs and the requirement that experts are cached efficiently. We first
present lower bounds on the competitive ratio of both deterministic and
randomized algorithms, which show that under mild assumptions, LRU-like
policies have good theoretical competitive performance. We then propose a
layer-based extension of LRU that is tailored to the problem at hand.
  Extensive simulations on both synthetic datasets and actual traces of MoE
usage show that our algorithm outperforms policies for the classic paging
problem, such as the standard LRU.

### [666] [Learnable Loss Geometries with Mirror Descent for Scalable and Convergent Meta-Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02418)
*Yilang Zhang,Bingcong Li,Georgios B. Giannakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a meta-learning approach that utilizes a versatile, nonlinear distance-generating function to enable efficient adaptation for few-shot tasks, achieving competitive convergence rates and superior empirical performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of sample-efficient adaptation in meta-learning, necessary for training task-specific models with minimal data and optimization steps.

Method: It proposes using a distance-generating function, implemented via an expressive neural network, to capture complex loss geometries and induce a nonlinear mirror map for effective optimization.

Result: The method achieves convergence rates of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$, comparable to standard meta-learning techniques, and demonstrates superior performance and faster adaptation in few-shot learning tests.

Conclusion: The approach provides an effective mechanism for rapid task-specific model training, showing promise for scaling meta-learning to large models and complex tasks.

Abstract: Utilizing task-invariant knowledge acquired from related tasks as prior
information, meta-learning offers a principled approach to learning a new task
with limited data records. Sample-efficient adaptation of this prior
information is a major challenge facing meta-learning, and plays an important
role because it facilitates training the sought task-specific model with just a
few optimization steps. Past works deal with this challenge through
preconditioning that speeds up convergence of the per-task training. Though
effective in representing locally quadratic loss curvatures, simple linear
preconditioning can be hardly potent with complex loss geometries. Instead of
relying on a quadratic distance metric, the present contribution copes with
complex loss metrics by learning a versatile distance-generating function,
which induces a nonlinear mirror map to effectively capture and optimize a wide
range of loss geometries. With suitable parameterization, this generating
function is effected by an expressive neural network that is provably a valid
distance. Analytical results establish convergence of not only the proposed
method, but also all meta-learning approaches based on preconditioning. To
attain gradient norm less than $\epsilon$, the convergence rate of
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ is on par with standard gradient-based
meta-learning methods. Numerical tests on few-shot learning datasets
demonstrate the superior empirical performance of the novel algorithm, as well
as its rapid per-task convergence, which markedly reduces the number of
adaptation steps, hence also accommodating large-scale meta-learning models.

### [667] [VASSO: Variance Suppression for Sharpness-Aware Minimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02433)
*Bingcong Li,Yilang Zhang,Georgios B. Giannakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the limitations of Sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) in enhancing generalization, proposing a method called VASSO to stabilize adversaries and achieve better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM enhances generalization by seeking flat minima in the loss function but suffers from over-friendly adversaries, limiting its effectiveness. The goal is to counter this issue for better generalization.

Method: The authors propose VASSO (Variance Suppression Stabilization of Adversaries), a general approach that suppresses adversary variance to stabilize adversarial contributions in SAM.

Result: Numerical evaluations show that integrating VASSO with SAM improves generalization across vision and language tasks, providing an advantageous tradeoff between generalization and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: VASSO effectively addresses the issue of over-friendly adversaries in SAM, enhancing its generalization capabilities while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) has well-documented merits in enhancing
generalization of deep neural network models. Accounting for sharpness in the
loss function geometry, where neighborhoods of `flat minima' heighten
generalization ability, SAM seeks `flat valleys' by minimizing the maximum loss
provoked by an adversarial perturbation within the neighborhood. Although
critical to account for sharpness of the loss function, in practice SAM suffers
from `over-friendly adversaries,' which can curtail the outmost level of
generalization. To avoid such `friendliness,' the present contribution fosters
stabilization of adversaries through variance suppression (VASSO). VASSO offers
a general approach to provably stabilize adversaries. In particular, when
integrating VASSO with SAM, improved generalizability is numerically validated
on extensive vision and language tasks. Once applied on top of a
computationally efficient SAM variant, VASSO offers a desirable
generalization-computation tradeoff.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Decision Transformer (DT)-based framework improving notification delivery under constraints of utility and user fatigue, surpassing traditional reinforcement learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance notification delivery while addressing utility, user fatigue, and limitations of existing reinforcement learning methods like CQL.

Method: A Decision Transformer framework employing return-conditioned supervised learning with additional features like quantile regression and circular buffer-based inference.

Result: Extensive experiments show improved notification utility and session activity while minimizing user fatigue, with a +0.72% increase in LinkedIn sessions compared to CQL.

Conclusion: The DT-based approach offers scalable, robust, and explainable notification recommendations, proving effective in real-world systems.

Abstract: Notifications are an important communication channel for delivering timely
and relevant information. Optimizing their delivery involves addressing complex
sequential decision-making challenges under constraints such as message utility
and user fatigue. Offline reinforcement learning (RL) methods, such as
Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), have been applied to this problem but face
practical challenges at scale, including instability, sensitivity to
distribution shifts, limited reproducibility, and difficulties with
explainability in high-dimensional recommendation settings. We present a
Decision Transformer (DT) based framework that reframes policy learning as
return-conditioned supervised learning, improving robustness, scalability, and
modeling flexibility. Our contributions include a real-world comparison with
CQL, a multi-reward design suitable for non-episodic tasks, a quantile
regression approach to return-to-go conditioning, and a production-ready system
with circular buffer-based sequence processing for near-real-time inference.
Extensive offline and online experiments in a deployed notification system show
that our approach improves notification utility and overall session activity
while minimizing user fatigue. Compared to a multi-objective CQL-based agent,
the DT-based approach achieved a +0.72% increase in sessions for notification
decision-making at LinkedIn by making notification recommendation more
relevant.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of publicly available datasets for machine learning research in energy networks, which this study aims to address by generating synthetic grids using machine learning approaches.

Method: The study employs variational graph autoencoders (VGAEs), experimenting with four decoder variants on two open-source datasets, ENGAGE and DINGO. Structural and spectral metrics are used for performance evaluation.

Result: Simple decoders failed to capture realistic grid topologies. GCN-based VGAEs performed well with ENGAGE but faced challenges with DINGO, including disconnected components and repeated motifs.

Conclusion: While VGAEs show promise in synthetic grid generation, their limitations make clear the need for more expressive generative models and improved evaluation methods. The research facilitates benchmarking by releasing models and findings as open-source.

Abstract: To address the lack of public power system data for machine learning research
in energy networks, we investigate the use of variational graph autoencoders
(VGAEs) for synthetic distribution grid generation. Using two open-source
datasets, ENGAGE and DINGO, we evaluate four decoder variants and compare
generated networks against the original grids using structural and spectral
metrics. Results indicate that simple decoders fail to capture realistic
topologies, while GCN-based approaches achieve strong fidelity on ENGAGE but
struggle on the more complex DINGO dataset, producing artifacts such as
disconnected components and repeated motifs. These findings highlight both the
promise and limitations of VGAEs for grid synthesis, underscoring the need for
more expressive generative models and robust evaluation. We release our models
and analysis as open source to support benchmarking and accelerate progress in
ML-driven power system research.

*Zhenghai Xue,Longtao Zheng,Qian Liu,Yingru Li,Xiaosen Zheng,Zejun Ma,Bo An*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SimpleTIR, an algorithm designed to address training instabilities in multi-turn Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) systems for large language models, resulting in state-of-the-art performance on math reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to solve the instability and performance issues in multi-turn TIR systems, which arise due to distributional drift and gradient norm explosions.

Method: The paper proposes the SimpleTIR algorithm, which filters out training trajectories with void turns, thereby blocking destabilizing gradients and stabilizing the learning process.

Result: SimpleTIR achieves state-of-the-art results, as demonstrated by the significant improvement of AIME24 scores from 22.1 to 50.5 when using the Qwen2.5-7B base model.

Conclusion: SimpleTIR offers a robust and efficient approach to multi-turn TIR training, not only stabilizing performance but also enhancing reasoning by enabling the discovery of diverse and sophisticated patterns.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can significantly improve their reasoning
capabilities by interacting with external tools, a paradigm known as
Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR). However, extending TIR to multi-turn scenarios
using Reinforcement Learning (RL) is often hindered by training instability and
performance collapse. We identify that such instability is primarily caused by
a distributional drift from external tool feedback, leading to the generation
of low-probability tokens. This issue compounds over successive turns, causing
catastrophic gradient norm explosions that derail the training process. To
address this challenge, we introduce SimpleTIR , a plug-and-play algorithm that
stabilizes multi-turn TIR training. Its core strategy is to identify and filter
out trajectories containing void turns, i.e., turns that yield neither a code
block nor a final answer. By removing these problematic trajectories from the
policy update, SimpleTIR effectively blocks the harmful, high-magnitude
gradients, thus stabilizing the learning dynamics. Extensive experiments show
that SimpleTIR achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging math
reasoning benchmarks, notably elevating the AIME24 score from a text-only
baseline of 22.1 to 50.5 when starting from the Qwen2.5-7B base model.
Furthermore, by avoiding the constraints of supervised fine-tuning, SimpleTIR
encourages the model to discover diverse and sophisticated reasoning patterns,
such as self-correction and cross-validation.

*Charles Pert,Dalal Alrajeh,Alessandra Russo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores whether recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can generalize to \(\omega\)-regular languages derived from linear temporal logic (LTL), achieving high accuracy on sequences much longer than the training examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Büchi automata, commonly used in reactive system verification, struggle with scalability, especially for complex behaviors. Neural networks have shown promise in addressing scalability but require investigation into their generalization capabilities for such tasks.

Method: The authors train recurrent neural networks (RNNs) on ultimately periodic \(\omega\)-word sequences to replicate the target Büchi automaton (BA) behavior. They evaluate the RNNs' generalization on sequences significantly longer than the training examples.

Result: RNNs demonstrated high accuracy (with 92.6% of tasks achieving near-perfect generalization) across LTL formulas of varying complexity, even for test sequences up to 8 times longer than those seen during training.

Conclusion: The study establishes the feasibility of using neural networks to learn complex \(\omega\)-regular languages, highlighting their potential in neurosymbolic verification methods.

Abstract: B\"uchi automata (BAs) recognize $\omega$-regular languages defined by formal
specifications like linear temporal logic (LTL) and are commonly used in the
verification of reactive systems. However, BAs face scalability challenges when
handling and manipulating complex system behaviors. As neural networks are
increasingly used to address these scalability challenges in areas like model
checking, investigating their ability to generalize beyond training data
becomes necessary. This work presents the first study investigating whether
recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can generalize to $\omega$-regular languages
derived from LTL formulas. We train RNNs on ultimately periodic $\omega$-word
sequences to replicate target BA behavior and evaluate how well they generalize
to out-of-distribution sequences. Through experiments on LTL formulas
corresponding to deterministic automata of varying structural complexity, from
3 to over 100 states, we show that RNNs achieve high accuracy on their target
$\omega$-regular languages when evaluated on sequences up to $8 \times$ longer
than training examples, with $92.6\%$ of tasks achieving perfect or
near-perfect generalization. These results establish the feasibility of neural
approaches for learning complex $\omega$-regular languages, suggesting their
potential as components in neurosymbolic verification methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MoPEQ, a post-training quantization algorithm for efficient deployment of MoE-based vision-language models, achieving competitive accuracy with significant memory savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational and memory challenges of deploying large Language and Vision Models using Mixture-of-Experts architectures.

Method: MoPEQ assigns optimal bit widths to experts based on a sensitivity analysis using Hessian trace approximation, avoiding reliance on activation frequency and clustering similar experts.

Result: Experimental results on benchmarks demonstrate competitive accuracy with substantial memory reductions compared to uniform-precision quantization methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers a fine-grained and efficient solution for balancing accuracy and memory requirements in mixed precision quantized VLM-MoEs.

Abstract: Large Language and Vision Models using a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
architecture pose significant challenges for deployment due to their
computational and memory demands. Mixed Precision Quantization assigns
different precisions to different layers of an LLM/VLM based on layer
sensitivity and importance within the model. In this work, we propose a Post
Training Quantization algorithm, MoPEQ, that assigns optimal bit width to each
expert. Our method balances accuracy and model size by analyzing each expert's
sensitivity using Hessian trace approximation instead of relying on the
activation frequency of the expert. This per-expert granularity approach
clusters similar experts to maintain model performance while reducing memory
requirements. The experimental results on VLMEvalKit benchmark datasets using
State-of-the-art VLMs Deepseek-VL2 -tiny, -small, -base, and MolmoE models
demonstrate that our mixed precision quantized MoEs achieve competitive
accuracy with substantial improvements in memory footprint compared to
uniform-precision baseline methods. We perform a comprehensive study to analyze
the impact of expert activation frequency and sensitivity using Hessian trace
approximation at both layer-wise and model-wide expert precision allocation of
2, 3, and 4 bits to provide a thorough understanding of mixed precision
quantization of VLM-MoEs.

*Eric J. Michaud,Liv Gorton,Tom McGrath*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates how sparse autoencoders (SAEs) scale with respect to their latent features, showing that feature manifolds can lead to SAEs learning fewer features than available latents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the behavior of sparse autoencoders (SAEs) under scaling, specifically the influence of multi-dimensional feature manifolds on their performance and limitations.

Method: The study adapts a capacity-allocation model from neural scaling literature to analyze SAE scaling and its relationship with feature manifolds, identifying distinct scaling regimes.

Result: The model identifies scaling regimes where feature manifolds restrict SAEs from learning as many features as there are latents, revealing a potential limitation in their architecture.

Conclusion: Feature manifolds can lead to pathological effects in SAEs, raising questions about their real-world performance and limitations in feature learning.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) model the activations of a neural network as
linear combinations of sparsely occurring directions of variation (latents).
The ability of SAEs to reconstruct activations follows scaling laws w.r.t. the
number of latents. In this work, we adapt a capacity-allocation model from the
neural scaling literature (Brill, 2024) to understand SAE scaling, and in
particular, to understand how "feature manifolds" (multi-dimensional features)
influence scaling behavior. Consistent with prior work, the model recovers
distinct scaling regimes. Notably, in one regime, feature manifolds have the
pathological effect of causing SAEs to learn far fewer features in data than
there are latents in the SAE. We provide some preliminary discussion on whether
or not SAEs are in this pathological regime in the wild.

### [674] [Speeding Up the NSGA-II via Dynamic Population Sizes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01739)
*Benjamin Doerr,Martin S. Krejca,Simon Wietheger*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper introduces dynamic NSGA-II (dNSGA-II), an enhancement of NSGA-II for solving multi-objective optimization problems via dynamic population sizes, achieving faster runtime for specific benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of traditional multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) that use large, static populations, which slow down computation.

Method: The dNSGA-II begins with a small population size, doubling it after specific evaluations ($\tau$) until a maximum size ($\mu$). Mathematical runtime analysis was employed to assess and optimize its performance.

Result: The dNSGA-II achieves $O(n \log(n))$ runtime, outperforming classic NSGA-II by a factor of $\Theta(n)$ with proper parameter tuning. Concurrent runs further optimize computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Dynamic population sizes in dNSGA-II deliver significant speed-ups in computing Pareto fronts compared to static population MOEAs. Tunable parameters enhance flexibility and reduce computational overhead.

Abstract: Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) are among the most widely and
successfully applied optimizers for multi-objective problems. However, to store
many optimal trade-offs (the Pareto optima) at once, MOEAs are typically run
with a large, static population of solution candidates, which can slow down the
algorithm. We propose the dynamic NSGA-II (dNSGA-II), which is based on the
popular NSGA-II and features a non-static population size. The dNSGA-II starts
with a small initial population size of four and doubles it after a
user-specified number $\tau$ of function evaluations, up to a maximum size of
$\mu$. Via a mathematical runtime analysis, we prove that the dNSGA-II with
parameters $\mu \geq 4(n + 1)$ and $\tau \geq \frac{256}{50} e n$ computes the
full Pareto front of the \textsc{OneMinMax} benchmark of size $n$ in
$O(\log(\mu) \tau + \mu \log(n))$ function evaluations, both in expectation and
with high probability. For an optimal choice of $\mu$ and $\tau$, the resulting
$O(n \log(n))$ runtime improves the optimal expected runtime of the classic
NSGA-II by a factor of $\Theta(n)$. In addition, we show that the parameter
$\tau$ can be removed when utilizing concurrent runs of the dNSGA-II. This
approach leads to a mild slow-down by a factor of $O(\log(n))$ compared to an
optimal choice of $\tau$ for the dNSGA-II, which is still a speed-up of
$\Theta(n / \log(n))$ over the classic NSGA-II.

*Zhongrui Chen,Adityo Anggraito,Diletta Olliaro,Andrea Marin,Marco Ajmone Marsan,Benjamin Berg,Isaac Grosof*

Main category: cs.PF

TL;DR: The paper addresses scheduling for multiserver jobs in data centers by introducing MSF-Quick Swap (MSFQ), which balances resource utilization and job waiting time variability, showing improved performance over existing policies like MSF and FCFS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop effective non-preemptive scheduling policies that minimize mean response time, maintain high resource utilization, and reduce variability in job waiting times for multiserver jobs in stateful data centers.

Method: The authors propose MSF-Quick Swap (MSFQ), a scheduling approach that periodically gives priority to different jobs to reduce waiting time variability. They use analytical methods and simulations to evaluate its performance against existing policies.

Result: MSFQ dramatically reduces job waiting time variability, maintains system stability, and significantly outperforms MSF and FCFS under specific scenarios. Simulation results further demonstrate its robustness across real-world workloads.

Conclusion: MSFQ represents a promising approach to tackling the challenges in scheduling multiserver jobs, achieving improved system utilization and reduced response times compared to existing policies. Variants of this policy are highly effective in practical applications.

Abstract: Modern data center workloads are composed of multiserver jobs, computational
jobs that require multiple CPU cores in order to run. A data center server can
run many multiserver jobs in parallel, as long as it has sufficient resources
to meet their demands. However, multiserver jobs are generally stateful,
meaning that job preemptions incur significant overhead from saving and
reloading the state associated with running jobs. Hence, most systems try to
avoid these costly job preemptions altogether. Given these constraints, a
scheduling policy must determine what set of jobs to run in parallel at each
moment in time to minimize the mean response time across a stream of arriving
jobs. Unfortunately, simple non-preemptive policies such as FCFS may leave many
cores idle, resulting in high mean response times or even system instability.
Our goal is to design and analyze non-preemptive scheduling policies for
multiserver jobs that maintain high system utilization to achieve low mean
response time.
  One well-known non-preemptive policy, Most Servers First (MSF), prioritizes
jobs with higher core requirements and achieves high resource utilization.
However, MSF causes extreme variability in job waiting times, and can perform
significantly worse than FCFS in practice. To address this, we propose and
analyze a class of scheduling policies called MSF-Quick Swap (MSFQ) that
performs well. MSFQ reduces the variability of job waiting times by
periodically granting priority to other jobs in the system. We provide both
stability results and an analysis of mean response time under MSFQ to prove
that our policy dramatically outperforms MSF in the case where jobs request one
core or all the cores. In more complex cases, we evaluate MSFQ in simulation.
We show that, with some additional optimization, variants of the MSFQ policy
can greatly outperform MSF and FCFS on real-world multiserver job workloads.

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the performance of RV-root-MUSIC algorithm and addresses the ambiguity caused by mirror roots, providing a statistical model and simulation validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The RV-root-MUSIC algorithm faces estimation ambiguity due to mirror roots, requiring further exploration to improve its practical applications.

Method: A theoretical analysis of perturbation effects is conducted, and statistical models alongside generalized expressions for noise, true root, and mirror root perturbations are developed.

Result: The statistical characteristics derived were validated through simulations, confirming their accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: This study establishes a theoretical basis for optimizing RV-root-MUSIC algorithm parameters in DOA estimation, benefiting applications like radars and communication networks.

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic theoretical performance analysis of the
Real-Valued root-MUSIC (RV-root-MUSIC) algorithm under non-asymptotic
conditions. However, RV-root-MUSIC suffers from the problem of estimation
ambiguity for the mirror roots, therefore the conventional beamforming (CBF)
technique is typically employed to filter out the mirror roots. Through the
equivalent subspace based on the conjugate extension method and the equivalence
of perturbations for both true roots and mirror roots , this paper provides a
comprehensive investigation of three critical aspects: noise subspace
perturbation, true root perturbation, and mirror root perturbation
characteristics in the RV-root-MUSIC algorithm. The statistical model is
established and the generalized expression of perturbation is further
developed. The simulation results show the correctness and validity of the
derived statistical characteristics. The results provide a solid theoretical
foundation for optimizing the parameter selection of DOA estimation in
practical applications, particularly in radar systems, communication networks,
and intelligent sensing technologies.

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: This paper introduces ChopChop, a framework to enable language models to generate code that satisfies rich and provable semantic properties, overcoming limitations of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models often fail to guarantee the correctness of code generation, producing outputs that may violate key program properties. Current solutions for constrained generation are limited to basic constraints or rely on unreliable semantic encodings.

Method: ChopChop connects token-level language generation with reasoning over program structures using a coinduction-based formalism. Constraint enforcement is treated as a realizability problem over regular codata, supporting rich semantic properties.

Result: The paper demonstrates ChopChop's effectiveness on constraints like type safety and program equivalence, seamlessly integrating formal methods into code generation while improving success rates and maintaining practical latency.

Conclusion: ChopChop provides a systematic and principled framework for semantically constrained code generation, transforming this area from niche to mainstream, and improving the reliability of language models in code-related tasks.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) can generate code, but cannot guarantee its
correctness--producing outputs that often violate type safety, program
invariants, or semantic equivalence. Constrained decoding offers a solution by
restricting generation to programs that satisfy desired properties. Yet,
existing methods are limited to shallow syntactic constraints or rely on
brittle, ad hoc encodings of semantics over token sequences.
  We present ChopChop, the first programmable framework for semantic
constrained decoding, enabling LMs to generate code that provably satisfies
rich semantic properties. ChopChop connects token-level generation with
reasoning over abstract program structures using a coinduction-based formalism
and reduces constraint enforcement to a realizability problem over regular
codata. We demonstrate ChopChop's generality through generation constrained by
type safety and program equivalence, showing how formal methods can be
seamlessly integrated into LM-driven code generation. ChopChop transforms
semantic constrained decoding from a niche technique into a systematic,
principled extension of LMs--improving success rates across models and tasks
while maintaining practical decoding latency.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the verification of program correctness related to symmetry properties, introducing a Hoare-style logic and developing the SymVerif tool.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the lack of formal methods that support reasoning about symmetry properties in program correctness.

Method: They propose a syntax for group actions to specify symmetry properties, introduce a Hoare-style logic for verification, and develop the SymVerif tool for practical application.

Result: Their approach successfully verified symmetry properties across several benchmarks. Additionally, the tool discovered an error in a dynamical system model.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates the viability of formally verifying symmetry properties of programs, contributing both theoretical methods and practical tools to the field.

Abstract: Many natural program correctness properties can be stated in terms of
  symmetries, but existing formal methods have little support for reasoning
  about such properties. We consider how to formally verify a broad class of
  symmetry properties expressed in terms of group actions. To specify these
  properties, we design a syntax for group actions, supporting standard
  constructions and a natural notion of entailment. Then, we develop a
  Hoare-style logic for verifying symmetry properties of imperative programs,
  where group actions take the place of the typical pre- and post-condition
  assertions. Finally, we develop a prototype tool $\mathsf{SymVerif}$, and use
  it to verify symmetry properties on a series of handcrafted benchmarks. Our
  tool uncovered an error in a model of a dynamical system described by
\citet{McLachlan_Quispel_2002}.

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new algorithm to lift G-code into cuboids and approximate point clouds, aiding error detection and comparative analysis in 3D printing workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in identifying errors in the 3D fabrication pipeline, due to the complexities of the representations involved, inspired the research.

Method: The proposed algorithm lifts G-code into cuboids and defines an approximate point cloud representation for efficient analysis.

Result: The prototype tool 'GlitchFinder' effectively identifies slicing issues, compares slicer outputs (Cura and PrusaSlicer), and evaluates mesh repair tools (MeshLab and Meshmixer) on 58 CAD models.

Conclusion: The method improves error detection and comparative analysis in the 3D fabrication pipeline, showing promise for enhancing model reliability.

Abstract: The computational fabrication pipeline for 3D printing is much like a
compiler - users design models in Computer Aided Design (CAD) tools that are
lowered to polygon meshes to be ultimately compiled to machine code by 3D
slicers. For traditional compilers and programming languages, techniques for
checking program invariants are well-established. Similarly, methods like
differential testing are often used to uncover bugs in compilers themselves,
which makes them more reliable. The fabrication pipeline would benefit from
similar techniques but traditional approaches do not directly apply to the
representations used in this domain. Unlike traditional programs, 3D models
exist both as geometric objects as well as machine code that ultimately runs on
the hardware. The machine code, like in traditional compiling, is affected by
many factors like the model, the slicer being used, and numerous
user-configurable parameters that control the slicing process. In this work, we
propose a new algorithm for lifting G-code (a common language used in
fabrication pipelines) by denoting a G-code program to a set of cuboids, and
then defining an approximate point cloud representation for efficiently
operating on these cuboids. Our algorithm opens up new opportunities: we show
three use cases that demonstrate how it enables error localization in CAD
models through invariant checking, quantitative comparisons between slicers,
and evaluating the efficacy of mesh repair tools. We present a prototype
implementation of our algorithm in a tool, GlitchFinder, and evaluate it on 58
real-world CAD models. Our results show that GlitchFinder is particularly
effective in identifying slicing issues due to small features, can highlight
differences in how popular slicers (Cura and PrusaSlicer) slice the same model,

### [680] [Decision Procedure for A Theory of String Sequences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00948)
*Denghang Hu,Taolue Chen,Philipp Rümmer,Fu Song,Zhilin Wu*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new theory of string sequences for SMT solvers, particularly addressing string operations absent in current frameworks, and demonstrates its efficacy using benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in SMT solvers which lack direct support for operations frequently used in string-manipulating programs, like regex matching or string splitting.

Method: The authors propose encoding string sequences and operations as corresponding string operations, integrate these into the OSTRICH framework, and develop the decision tool 'ostrichseq'.

Result: Experimental results on benchmarks from real-world JavaScript programs and crafted templates show that their approach is effective.

Conclusion: The study establishes a framework for handling string sequence operations within SMT solvers and offers a practical tool validated by experiments.

Abstract: The theory of sequences, supported by many SMT solvers, can model program
data types including bounded arrays and lists. Sequences are parameterized by
the element data type and provide operations such as accessing elements,
concatenation, forming sub-sequences and updating elements. Strings and
sequences are intimately related; many operations, e.g., matching a string
according to a regular expression, splitting strings, or joining strings in a
sequence, are frequently used in string-manipulating programs. Nevertheless,
these operations are typically not directly supported by existing SMT solvers,
which instead only consider the generic theory of sequences. In this paper, we
propose a theory of string sequences and study its satisfiability. We show
that, while it is undecidable in general, the decidability can be recovered by
restricting to the straight-line fragment. This is shown by encoding each
string sequence as a string, and each string sequence operation as a
corresponding string operation. We provide pre-image computation for the
resulting string operations with respect to automata, effectively casting it
into the generic OSTRICH string constraint solving framework. We implement the
new decision procedure as a tool $\ostrichseq$, and carry out experiments on
benchmark constraints generated from real-world JavaScript programs,
hand-crafted templates and unit tests. The experiments confirm the efficacy of
our approach.

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: This work generalizes refinement types with underapproximation reasoning for functional programming, connecting it to Incorrectness Logic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve property-based testing frameworks by enhancing correctness and completeness verification of test generators within functional languages.

Method: Explores how underapproximation reasoning from Incorrectness Logic can integrate into existing refinement type systems of functional programming.

Result: Proposes mechanisms to combine incorrectness reasoning with expressive refinement type systems.

Conclusion: Integration promises benefits for functional programmers, program verifiers, and analyzer tools to enhance software analysis and verification.

Abstract: A coverage type generalizes refinement types found in many functional
languages with support for must-style underapproximate reasoning.
Property-based testing frameworks are one particularly useful domain where such
capabilities are useful as they allow us to verify the completeness, as well as
safety, of test generators. There is a surprising connection between the kind
of underapproximate reasoning coverage types offer and the style of reasoning
enabled by recently proposed Incorrectness Logic frameworks. In our
presentation, we propose to explore this connection more deeply, identifying
mechanisms that more systematically integrate incorrectness reasoning within an
expressive refinement type system and the opportunities that such integration
offers to functional programmers, program verifiers, and program analyzers and
related tools.

### [682] [From Traces to Program Incorrectness: A Type-Theoretic Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02428)
*Yongwei Yuan,Zhe Zhou,Julia Belyakova,Benjamin Delaware,Suresh Jagannathan*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a type-theoretic framework for reasoning about incorrect functional programs interacting with library APIs, using traces modeled by symbolic regular expressions (SREs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of reasoning about incorrectness in functional programs interacting with opaque, effect-driven library APIs, and provide a systematic way to specify and analyze such behaviors.

Method: The authors developed a type inference algorithm based on symbolic finite automata (SFAs) that reasons compositionally about API traces against predefined incorrectness properties modeled by SREs.

Result: The algorithm successfully infers types witnessing subsets of specified incorrect behaviors in abstract data type (ADT) implementations, enabling systematic trace-based underapproximate analysis.

Conclusion: This work pioneers a systematic, trace-guided, compositional reasoning framework for analyzing functionally incorrect program behaviors in the context of effectful library APIs.

Abstract: We present a type-theoretic framework for reasoning about incorrectness in
functional programs that interact with effectful, opaque library APIs. Our
approach centers on traces -- temporally-ordered sequences of library API
invocations -- which naturally characterize both the preconditions of
individual APIs and their composite behavior. We represent these traces using
symbolic regular expressions (SREs), enabling formal specification of incorrect
abstract data type (ADT) behaviors across function boundaries. The core
contribution is a novel type inference algorithm that operates modulo specified
incorrectness properties and leverages the symbolic finite automata (SFAs)
representations of regexes for compositional reasoning of traces. When the
algorithm succeeds, the inferred types witness that an ADT implementation can
exhibit some subset of the specified incorrect behaviors. This represents the
first systematic approach to underapproximate reasoning against trace-based
incorrectness specifications, enabling a new form of trace-guided compositional
analysis.

### [683] [Robotic Fire Risk Detection based on Dynamic Knowledge Graph Reasoning: An LLM-Driven Approach with Graph Chain-of-Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00054)
*Haimei Pan,Jiyun Zhang,Qinxi Wei,Xiongnan Jin,Chen Xinkai,Jie Cheng*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new framework called IOG, combining knowledge graphs and multimodal models to enhance robot response in fire scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fire disasters pose significant challenges for prevention and response, especially due to limited perception and delayed action. Robots can mitigate risk and support decision-making in such scenarios.

Method: The authors build a knowledge graph using large language models to integrate fire-related domain knowledge and develop the IOG framework, which utilizes real-time imagery for risk detection and response planning.

Result: Simulations and real-world tests demonstrate the framework’s effectiveness in early fire risk detection and generating structured robotic action plans.

Conclusion: The IOG framework holds promise for improving fire risk management and advancing interpretability in automated emergency response systems.

Abstract: Fire is a highly destructive disaster, but effective prevention can
significantly reduce its likelihood of occurrence. When it happens, deploying
emergency robots in fire-risk scenarios can help minimize the danger to human
responders. However, current research on pre-disaster warnings and
disaster-time rescue still faces significant challenges due to incomplete
perception, inadequate fire situational awareness, and delayed response. To
enhance intelligent perception and response planning for robots in fire
scenarios, we first construct a knowledge graph (KG) by leveraging large
language models (LLMs) to integrate fire domain knowledge derived from fire
prevention guidelines and fire rescue task information from robotic emergency
response documents. We then propose a new framework called Insights-on-Graph
(IOG), which integrates the structured fire information of KG and Large
Multimodal Models (LMMs). The framework generates perception-driven risk graphs
from real-time scene imagery to enable early fire risk detection and provide
interpretable emergency responses for task module and robot component
configuration based on the evolving risk situation. Extensive simulations and
real-world experiments show that IOG has good applicability and practical
application value in fire risk detection and rescue decision-making.

TL;DR: This paper introduces U2UData-2, a large-scale dataset and platform designed for autonomous swarm UAVs undertaking long-horizon (LH) tasks, addressing the limitations in current datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable and advance real-world deployment of autonomous swarm UAVs for complex, long-horizon tasks, overcoming limitations of existing small-scale datasets.

Method: The authors developed the U2UData-2 dataset capturing data from 15 UAVs flying 12 scenes with various environmental parameters, alongside a customizable platform for data collection and closed-loop algorithm verification.

Result: The dataset includes 720 traces, 120 hours, and 4.32M LiDAR frames. Benchmarks with 9 SOTA models and a wildlife conservation task are provided.

Conclusion: U2UData-2 is a scalable and innovative resource for the development of autonomous swarm UAVs in dynamic and persistent long-horizon tasks.

Abstract: Swarm UAV autonomous flight for Long-Horizon (LH) tasks is crucial for
advancing the low-altitude economy. However, existing methods focus only on
specific basic tasks due to dataset limitations, failing in real-world
deployment for LH tasks. LH tasks are not mere concatenations of basic tasks,
requiring handling long-term dependencies, maintaining persistent states, and
adapting to dynamic goal shifts. This paper presents U2UData-2, the first
large-scale swarm UAV autonomous flight dataset for LH tasks and the first
scalable swarm UAV data online collection and algorithm closed-loop
verification platform. The dataset is captured by 15 UAVs in autonomous
collaborative flights for LH tasks, comprising 12 scenes, 720 traces, 120
hours, 600 seconds per trajectory, 4.32M LiDAR frames, and 12.96M RGB frames.
This dataset also includes brightness, temperature, humidity, smoke, and
airflow values covering all flight routes. The platform supports the
customization of simulators, UAVs, sensors, flight algorithms, formation modes,
and LH tasks. Through a visual control window, this platform allows users to
collect customized datasets through one-click deployment online and to verify
algorithms by closed-loop simulation. U2UData-2 also introduces an LH task for
wildlife conservation and provides comprehensive benchmarks with 9 SOTA models.

*Yingjun Tian,Guoxin Fang,Renbo Su,Aoran Lyu,Neelotpal Dutta,Simeon Gill,Andrew Weightman,Charlie C. L. Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a neural network-based method for sim-to-real learning of deformable surfaces without relying on precise marker correspondences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional sim-to-real transfer relies heavily on marker points with full correspondences, which may be impractical or error-prone in real-world scenarios.

Method: The method involves a neural network to learn both a deformation function space and a confidence map, allowing sim-to-real transfer using point clouds or marker points with missing data.

Result: The approach was tested on four pneumatically actuated soft robots and integrated into a neural network pipeline for effective inverse kinematics and shape control.

Conclusion: The method is versatile, adaptable, and does not depend on high-quality marker correspondences, making it useful for various vision devices and robotic applications.

Abstract: This paper presents a correspondence-free, function-based sim-to-real
learning method for controlling deformable freeform surfaces. Unlike
traditional sim-to-real transfer methods that strongly rely on marker points
with full correspondences, our approach simultaneously learns a deformation
function space and a confidence map -- both parameterized by a neural network
-- to map simulated shapes to their real-world counterparts. As a result, the
sim-to-real learning can be conducted by input from either a 3D scanner as
point clouds (without correspondences) or a motion capture system as marker
points (tolerating missed markers). The resultant sim-to-real transfer can be
seamlessly integrated into a neural network-based computational pipeline for
inverse kinematics and shape control. We demonstrate the versatility and
adaptability of our method on both vision devices and across four pneumatically
actuated soft robots: a deformable membrane, a robotic mannequin, and two soft
manipulators.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robotic solutions for rebar tasks focus on flat rebar setups and rely heavily on model training, leaving gaps in adaptability and efficiency for complex, real-world situations.

Method: OpenTie employs a robotic arm with a binocular camera, utilizing prompt-based object detection on post-processed images converted from RGB to point clouds for precise rebar tying.

Result: The system demonstrates flexibility for both horizontal and vertical tying tasks, with real-world experiments validating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: OpenTie offers a practical and accurate framework for rebar tying, eliminating the need for training while addressing both horizontal and vertical setups effectively.

Abstract: Robotic practices on the construction site emerge as an attention-attracting
manner owing to their capability of tackle complex challenges, especially in
the rebar-involved scenarios. Most of existing products and research are mainly
focused on flat rebar setting with model training demands. To fulfill this gap,
we propose OpenTie, a 3D training-free rebar tying framework utilizing a
RGB-to-point-cloud generation and an open-vocabulary detection. We implements
the OpenTie via a robotic arm with a binocular camera and guarantees a high
accuracy by applying the prompt-based object detection method on the image

generation framework. The system is flexible for horizontal and vertical rebar
tying tasks and the experiments on the real-world rebar setting verifies that

*Zhitao Wang,Yirong Xiong,Roberto Horowitz,Yanke Wang,Yuxing Han*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid method combining geometry-based perception and advanced motion planning to efficiently automate rebar tying with reduced training data in complex construction environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual rebar tying is labor-intensive and poses ergonomic risks, highlighting the need for automated solutions to improve construction safety and efficiency.

Method: The authors developed a hybrid system integrating density-based clustering (DBSCAN) for rebar identification and Diffusion-EDFs for motion planning, requiring minimal demonstrations and training data.

Result: The system achieved high success rates in detecting rebar nodes and sequential tying across various mesh configurations, outperforming traditional methods in efficiency and adaptability.

Conclusion: This hybrid approach reduces data dependency and manual adjustment, offering a promising avenue for safer and more efficient construction automation.

Abstract: Rebar tying is a repetitive but critical task in reinforced concrete
construction, typically performed manually at considerable ergonomic risk.
Recent advances in robotic manipulation hold the potential to automate the
tying process, yet face challenges in accurately estimating tying poses in
congested rebar nodes. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid perception and
motion planning approach that integrates geometry-based perception with
Equivariant Denoising Diffusion on SE(3) (Diffusion-EDFs) to enable robust
multi-node rebar tying with minimal training data. Our perception module
utilizes density-based clustering (DBSCAN), geometry-based node feature
extraction, and principal component analysis (PCA) to segment rebar bars,
identify rebar nodes, and estimate orientation vectors for sequential ranking,
even in complex, unstructured environments. The motion planner, based on
Diffusion-EDFs, is trained on as few as 5-10 demonstrations to generate
sequential end-effector poses that optimize collision avoidance and tying
efficiency. The proposed system is validated on various rebar meshes, including
single-layer, multi-layer, and cluttered configurations, demonstrating high
success rates in node detection and accurate sequential tying. Compared with
conventional approaches that rely on large datasets or extensive manual
parameter tuning, our method achieves robust, efficient, and adaptable
multi-node tying while significantly reducing data requirements. This result
underscores the potential of hybrid perception and diffusion-driven planning to
enhance automation in on-site construction tasks, improving both safety and
labor efficiency.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper evaluates 13 trajectory reconstruction methods, focusing on their performance using AVL data and highlights the benefits of velocity-aware techniques. The VCHIP-ME method performs best.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve the utility of Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) data by overcoming limitations due to inconsistent update frequencies, a challenge in transit analysis.

Method: It evaluates 13 trajectory reconstruction methods, using a framework that applies mathematical error metrics and practical physical realism evaluations, across sparse and dense datasets.

Result: Velocity-aware methods outperformed position-only approaches, with the velocity-constrained Hermite interpolation with monotonicity enforcement (VCHIP-ME) achieving the best balance between accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: The research underscores the importance of dense AVL data and velocity-aware methods, advising practical adoption of VCHIP-ME for real-time and historical applications in urban contexts.

Abstract: Automatic vehicle location (AVL) data offers insights into transit dynamics,
but its effectiveness is often hampered by inconsistent update frequencies,
necessitating trajectory reconstruction. This research evaluates 13 trajectory
reconstruction methods, including several novel approaches, using
high-resolution AVL data from Austin, Texas. We examine the interplay of four
critical factors -- velocity, position, smoothing, and data density -- on
reconstruction performance. A key contribution of this study is evaluation of
these methods across sparse and dense datasets, providing insights into the
trade-off between accuracy and resource allocation. Our evaluation framework
combines traditional mathematical error metrics for positional and velocity
with practical considerations, such as physical realism (e.g., aligning
velocity and acceleration with stopped states, deceleration rates, and speed
variability). In addition, we provide insight into the relative value of each
method in calculating realistic metrics for infrastructure evaluations. Our
findings indicate that velocity-aware methods consistently outperform
position-only approaches. Interestingly, we discovered that smoothing-based
methods can degrade overall performance in complex, congested urban
environments, although enforcing monotonicity remains critical. The velocity
constrained Hermite interpolation with monotonicity enforcement (VCHIP-ME)
yields optimal results, offering a balance between high accuracy and
computational efficiency. Its minimal overhead makes it suitable for both
historical analysis and real-time applications, providing significant
predictive power when combined with dense datasets. These findings offer
practical guidance for researchers and practitioners implementing trajectory
reconstruction systems and emphasize the importance of investing in
higher-frequency AVL data collection for improved analysis.

*Marina Y. Aoyama,Joao Moura,Juan Del Aguila Ferrandis,Sethu Vijayakumar*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a reinforcement learning-based method for robots to efficiently identify object properties and transition to task execution, with a focus on improving success rates in dynamic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots in dynamic tasks need to accurately identify relevant object properties for successful execution, as failures are hard to recover from without human intervention.

Method: The paper proposes a reinforcement learning approach for task-informed exploration, using sensitivity-based rewards and an uncertainty mechanism to determine transition timing.

Result: The method achieves a 90% success rate in striking tasks with minimal exploration time, outperforming baselines that achieve only 40% success.

Conclusion: The approach effectively identifies object properties and optimizes task execution, validated on a striking task and the CartPole example, as well as in physical experiments with a KUKA iiwa arm.

Abstract: In many dynamic robotic tasks, such as striking pucks into a goal outside the
reachable workspace, the robot must first identify the relevant physical
properties of the object for successful task execution, as it is unable to
recover from failure or retry without human intervention. To address this
challenge, we propose a task-informed exploration approach, based on
reinforcement learning, that trains an exploration policy using rewards
automatically generated from the sensitivity of a privileged task policy to
errors in estimated properties. We also introduce an uncertainty-based
mechanism to determine when to transition from exploration to task execution,
ensuring sufficient property estimation accuracy with minimal exploration time.
Our method achieves a 90% success rate on the striking task with an average
exploration time under 1.2 seconds, significantly outperforming baselines that
achieve at most 40% success or require inefficient querying and retraining in a
simulator at test time. Additionally, we demonstrate that our task-informed
rewards capture the relative importance of physical properties in both the
striking task and the classical CartPole example. Finally, we validate our
approach by demonstrating its ability to identify object properties and adjust
task execution in a physical setup using the KUKA iiwa robot arm.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a reinforcement learning method that uses a hybrid approach to compute gradients via backpropagation through a learned model of the simulator while unrolling trajectories using a simulator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning methods that leverage simulator gradients show promise but have limitations such as implementation costs, unavailability of gradients, or compounding errors in learned dynamics models.

Method: The authors combine simulation-based trajectory rollouts with gradient computation using a learned differentiable model of the simulator, enabling improved policy optimization and accurate critic learning.

Result: The proposed method reaches the sample efficiency and speed of specialized tools like SHAC, avoids common issues in first-order MBRL methods, and performs well on benchmark tasks and real robot locomotion tasks.

Conclusion: This hybrid design enhances policy optimization robustness and efficiency, making it applicable to both simulated environments and real-world robotics tasks.

Abstract: There is growing interest in reinforcement learning (RL) methods that
leverage the simulator's derivatives to improve learning efficiency. While
early gradient-based approaches have demonstrated superior performance compared
to derivative-free methods, accessing simulator gradients is often impractical
due to their implementation cost or unavailability. Model-based RL (MBRL) can
approximate these gradients via learned dynamics models, but the solver
efficiency suffers from compounding prediction errors during training rollouts,
which can degrade policy performance. We propose an approach that decouples
trajectory generation from gradient computation: trajectories are unrolled
using a simulator, while gradients are computed via backpropagation through a
learned differentiable model of the simulator. This hybrid design enables
efficient and consistent first-order policy optimization, even when simulator
gradients are unavailable, as well as learning a critic from simulation
rollouts, which is more accurate. Our method achieves the sample efficiency and
speed of specialized optimizers such as SHAC, while maintaining the generality
of standard approaches like PPO and avoiding ill behaviors observed in other
first-order MBRL methods. We empirically validate our algorithm on benchmark
control tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness on a real Go2 quadruped robot,
across both quadrupedal and bipedal locomotion tasks.

*Yishu Li,Xinyi Mao,Ying Yuan,Kyutae Sim,Ben Eisner,David Held*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces HAVE, a system to resolve uncertainty in robot-object interactions using past interaction data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots often face visual ambiguities with objects that require physical interaction to resolve, highlighting the need for effective action-verification mechanisms.

Method: The paper proposes HAVE, combining an unconditional diffusion-based action generator with a history-aware verifier to select actions based on previous interactions.

Result: Theoretical and empirical evaluations show that HAVE improves action quality and outperforms baselines in simulated and real-world environments.

Conclusion: Decoupling action generation from verification and incorporating history-aware reasoning significantly enhances the resolution of ambiguous interaction scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce a novel History-Aware VErifier (HAVE) to disambiguate uncertain
scenarios online by leveraging past interactions. Robots frequently encounter
visually ambiguous objects whose manipulation outcomes remain uncertain until
physically interacted with. While generative models alone could theoretically
adapt to such ambiguity, in practice they obtain suboptimal performance in
ambiguous cases, even when conditioned on action history. To address this, we
propose explicitly decoupling action generation from verification: we use an
unconditional diffusion-based generator to propose multiple candidate actions
and employ our history-aware verifier to select the most promising action by
reasoning about past interactions. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate
that employing a verifier significantly improves expected action quality.
Empirical evaluations and analysis across multiple simulated and real-world
environments including articulated objects, multi-modal doors, and uneven
object pick-up confirm the effectiveness of our method and improvements over
baselines. Our project website is available at:

TL;DR: TReF-6 introduces a method enabling robots to generalize from a single demonstration by inferring a 6DoF Task-Relevant Frame using trajectory geometry and vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots often fail to generalize tasks from a single demonstration due to non-transferable spatial representations.

Method: The method uses trajectory geometry to identify an influence point for a local frame and incorporates vision-language models for task context. It permits robust, one-shot imitation learning across diverse setups.

Result: Simulations show robustness to trajectory noise, and real-world tests demonstrate preservation of task intent across varying object configurations.

Conclusion: TReF-6 enables effective one-shot imitation learning and consistent task generalization across novel scenarios.

Abstract: Robots often struggle to generalize from a single demonstration due to the
lack of a transferable and interpretable spatial representation. In this work,
we introduce TReF-6, a method that infers a simplified, abstracted 6DoF
Task-Relevant Frame from a single trajectory. Our approach identifies an
influence point purely from the trajectory geometry to define the origin for a
local frame, which serves as a reference for parameterizing a Dynamic Movement
Primitive (DMP). This influence point captures the task's spatial structure,
extending the standard DMP formulation beyond start-goal imitation. The
inferred frame is semantically grounded via a vision-language model and
localized in novel scenes by Grounded-SAM, enabling functionally consistent
skill generalization. We validate TReF-6 in simulation and demonstrate
robustness to trajectory noise. We further deploy an end-to-end pipeline on
real-world manipulation tasks, showing that TReF-6 supports one-shot imitation
learning that preserves task intent across diverse object configurations.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a Task and Motion Planning (TMP) framework called TMP-EAOG, designed for robot autonomy in space environments, using AND/OR graphs to address uncertainties and adapt to diverse scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic autonomy in space encounters significant issues such as perception uncertainty, motion constraints, and limited human intervention, necessitating effective task and motion planning methods.

Method: The authors propose TMP-EAOG, a framework that uses iteratively expanding AND/OR graphs to manage task abstraction and assess motion feasibility during execution. This method accommodates uncertainties and allows human validation of plans.

Result: TMP-EAOG is tested on two benchmarks using a simulated mobile manipulator. The evaluation highlights its ability to handle various challenges in space-related tasks.

Conclusion: TMP-EAOG demonstrates robustness to uncertainties, offers controlled autonomy with human validation, and provides flexibility to adapt to unexpected events, making it suitable for complex space missions.

Abstract: Robot autonomy in space environments presents unique challenges, including
high perception and motion uncertainty, strict kinematic constraints, and
limited opportunities for human intervention. Therefore, Task and Motion
Planning (TMP) may be critical for autonomous servicing, surface operations, or
even in-orbit missions, just to name a few, as it models tasks as discrete
action sequencing integrated with continuous motion feasibility assessments. In
this paper, we introduce a TMP framework based on expanding AND/OR graphs,
referred to as TMP-EAOG, and demonstrate its adaptability to different
scenarios. TMP-EAOG encodes task-level abstractions within an AND/OR graph,
which expands iteratively as the plan is executed, and performs in-the-loop
motion planning assessments to ascertain their feasibility. As a consequence,
TMP-EAOG is characterised by the desirable properties of (i) robustness to a
certain degree of uncertainty, because AND/OR graph expansion can accommodate
for unpredictable information about the robot environment, (ii) controlled
autonomy, since an AND/OR graph can be validated by human experts, and (iii)
bounded flexibility, in that unexpected events, including the assessment of
unfeasible motions, can lead to different courses of action as alternative
paths in the AND/OR graph. We evaluate TMP-EAOG on two benchmark domains. We
use a simulated mobile manipulator as a proxy for space-grade autonomous
robots. Our evaluation shows that TMP-EAOG can deal with a wide range of
challenges in the benchmarks.

Result: The CAN strategy achieved a 100% success rate with a 1.6 mm average error in standard environments and 85% success in challenging scenarios with disturbances.

Conclusion: The presented DRL-based CAN method significantly improves FRE navigation precision and reliability compared to baseline methods, demonstrating its potential for critical surgical applications.

Abstract: Navigating a flexible robotic endoscope (FRE) through the gastrointestinal
tract is critical for surgical diagnosis and treatment. However, navigation in
the dynamic stomach is particularly challenging because the FRE must learn to
effectively use contact with the deformable stomach walls to reach target
locations. To address this, we introduce a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
based Contact-Aided Navigation (CAN) strategy for FREs, leveraging contact
force feedback to enhance motion stability and navigation precision. The
training environment is established using a physics-based finite element method
(FEM) simulation of a deformable stomach. Trained with the Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) algorithm, our approach achieves high navigation success
rates (within 3 mm error between the FRE's end-effector and target) and
significantly outperforms baseline policies. In both static and dynamic stomach
environments, the CAN agent achieved a 100% success rate with 1.6 mm average
error, and it maintained an 85% success rate in challenging unseen scenarios
with stronger external disturbances. These results validate that the DRL-based
CAN strategy substantially enhances FRE navigation performance over prior
methods.

*Bear Häon,Kaylene Stocking,Ian Chuang,Claire Tomlin*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for interpreting and steering Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models using their internal transformer representations. It facilitates real-time behavioral control in robotics, emphasizing robustness and explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of lacking mechanistic insights in Vision-Language-Action models, which is critical for deploying robust and explainable policies in real-world robotics.

Method: The paper introduces a method for projecting activations of transformer-based VLAs onto the token embedding basis to identify interpretable semantic directions linked to actions. A general-purpose activation steering method is proposed to modulate behavior in real time, without fine-tuning or interactions with the environment.

Result: The approach is tested on models Pi0 and OpenVLA, demonstrating zero-shot behavioral control in both simulation (LIBERO) and physical robotics (UR5).

Conclusion: This work establishes a new paradigm for transparent and steerable vision-language-action models in robotics, enhancing robustness and control through systematic interpretability.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are a promising path to realizing
generalist embodied agents that can quickly adapt to new tasks, modalities, and
environments. However, methods for interpreting and steering VLAs fall far
short of classical robotics pipelines, which are grounded in explicit models of
kinematics, dynamics, and control. This lack of mechanistic insight is a
central challenge for deploying learned policies in real-world robotics, where
robustness and explainability are critical. Motivated by advances in
mechanistic interpretability for large language models, we introduce the first
framework for interpreting and steering VLAs via their internal
representations, enabling direct intervention in model behavior at inference
time. We project feedforward activations within transformer layers onto the
token embedding basis, identifying sparse semantic directions - such as speed
and direction - that are causally linked to action selection. Leveraging these
findings, we introduce a general-purpose activation steering method that
modulates behavior in real time, without fine-tuning, reward signals, or
environment interaction. We evaluate this method on two recent open-source
VLAs, Pi0 and OpenVLA, and demonstrate zero-shot behavioral control in
simulation (LIBERO) and on a physical robot (UR5). This work demonstrates that
interpretable components of embodied VLAs can be systematically harnessed for
control - establishing a new paradigm for transparent and steerable foundation
models in robotics.

*Yu Tian,Chi Kit Ng,Hongliang Ren*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces JEDP-RL, a planning framework for deformable continuum robots (DCRs) that focuses on improving policy convergence, navigation efficiency, and generalization ability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional planning techniques and reinforcement learning methods struggle with the nonlinear mechanics and partial state observability of DCRs, necessitating a novel approach.

Method: JEDP-RL decomposes planning into two phases: local exploratory Jacobian estimation and policy execution using augmented Jacobian features to restore approximate Markovianity.

Result: Experiments show significant advantages over PPO baselines, including faster convergence (3.2x), reduced navigation steps (25% fewer), and better generalization rates (up to 33% improvement in unseen tissue environments).

Conclusion: JEDP-RL offers a practical and efficient solution for addressing the challenges in planning deformable continuum robotic systems, paving the way for better adaptation in variable and unseen conditions.

Abstract: Deformable continuum robots (DCRs) present unique planning challenges due to
nonlinear deformation mechanics and partial state observability, violating the
Markov assumptions of conventional reinforcement learning (RL) methods. While
Jacobian-based approaches offer theoretical foundations for rigid manipulators,
their direct application to DCRs remains limited by time-varying kinematics and
underactuated deformation dynamics. This paper proposes Jacobian Exploratory
Dual-Phase RL (JEDP-RL), a framework that decomposes planning into phased
Jacobian estimation and policy execution. During each training step, we first
perform small-scale local exploratory actions to estimate the deformation
Jacobian matrix, then augment the state representation with Jacobian features
to restore approximate Markovianity. Extensive SOFA surgical dynamic
simulations demonstrate JEDP-RL's three key advantages over proximal policy
optimization (PPO) baselines: 1) Convergence speed: 3.2x faster policy
convergence, 2) Navigation efficiency: requires 25% fewer steps to reach the
target, and 3) Generalization ability: achieve 92% success rate under material
property variations and achieve 83% (33% higher than PPO) success rate in the
unseen tissue environment.

improve safety in aggregate handling, while providing a scalable framework for
advancing smart automation in construction, mining, and recycling industries.

Result: Experiments show GVF-TAPE reduces dependence on task-specific data, generalizes effectively, and performs adaptively in both simulated and real-world conditions.

Conclusion: GVF-TAPE offers a scalable and practical solution for intelligent robotic manipulation systems, excelling in task diversity and robustness.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation in unstructured environments requires systems that can
generalize across diverse tasks while maintaining robust and reliable
performance. We introduce {GVF-TAPE}, a closed-loop framework that combines
generative visual foresight with task-agnostic pose estimation to enable
scalable robotic manipulation. GVF-TAPE employs a generative video model to
predict future RGB-D frames from a single side-view RGB image and a task
description, offering visual plans that guide robot actions. A decoupled pose
estimation model then extracts end-effector poses from the predicted frames,
translating them into executable commands via low-level controllers. By
iteratively integrating video foresight and pose estimation in a closed loop,
GVF-TAPE achieves real-time, adaptive manipulation across a broad range of
tasks. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world settings
demonstrate that our approach reduces reliance on task-specific action data and
generalizes effectively, providing a practical and scalable solution for
intelligent robotic systems.

multi-modal diagnosis. In this paper, we outline the general concept of our
device, followed by a detailed description of its mechanical design and control
scheme. We conclude with the validation of the system through a series of

Motivation: The study seeks to address limitations in existing methods: the computed torque method suffers from parameter inaccuracies, and deep reinforcement learning has sample inefficiency and stability issues.

Method: The method integrates deep reinforcement learning with a computed torque controller, using the TD3 algorithm, parameter constraints, and damping techniques.

Result: The proposed method was tested in simulation using the MuJoCo physics engine and outperformed traditional computed torque and kinematic control methods.

Conclusion: Enhanced tracking performance for mobile robots is achieved by leveraging a hybrid approach that combines the advantages of computed torque and deep reinforcement learning.

Abstract: This study presents a learning-based nonlinear algorithm for tracking control
of differential-drive mobile robots. The Computed Torque Method (CTM) suffers
from inaccurate knowledge of system parameters, while Deep Reinforcement
Learning (DRL) algorithms are known for sample inefficiency and weak stability
guarantees. The proposed method replaces the black-box policy network of a DRL
agent with a gray-box Computed Torque Controller (CTC) to improve sample
efficiency and ensure closed-loop stability. This approach enables finding an
optimal set of controller parameters for an arbitrary reward function using
only a few short learning episodes. The Twin-Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy
Gradient (TD3) algorithm is used for this purpose. Additionally, some
controller parameters are constrained to lie within known value ranges,
ensuring the RL agent learns physically plausible values. A technique is also
applied to enforce a critically damped closed-loop time response. The
controller's performance is evaluated on a differential-drive mobile robot
simulated in the MuJoCo physics engine and compared against the raw CTC and a
conventional kinematic controller.

Abstract: Cinematic camera control demands a balance of precision and artistry -
qualities that are difficult to encode through handcrafted reward functions.
While reinforcement learning (RL) has been applied to robotic filmmaking, its
reliance on bespoke rewards and extensive tuning limits creative usability. We

lower variance. Crucially, it transfers directly to a real-world robot without
fine-tuning, achieving more consistent framing and subject alignment than a

Abstract: We present Galaxea Open-World Dataset, a large-scale, diverse collection of
robot behaviors recorded in authentic human living and working environments.
All demonstrations are gathered using a consistent robotic embodiment, paired
with precise subtask-level language annotations to facilitate both training and
evaluation. Building on this dataset, we introduce G0, a dual-system framework
that couples a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for multimodal planning with a

together with the Galaxea Open-World Dataset, plays a critical role in
achieving strong performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in ensuring safe and smooth interactions between autonomous vehicles and human-driven vehicles during lane changes.

Method: A double quintic polynomial trajectory optimization framework with embedded time-to-collision evaluation, real-time adaptive adjustments, and closed-form solver integration.

Result: The method demonstrated superior safety, efficiency, and comfort compared to conventional models, enabling collision-free and smoother transitions in simulations.

Conclusion: This approach offers a scalable and adaptive solution for autonomous driving applications, bridging model-based and adaptive planning techniques.

Abstract: Autonomous driving technology has made significant advancements in recent
years, yet challenges remain in ensuring safe and comfortable interactions with
human-driven vehicles (HDVs), particularly during lane-changing maneuvers. This
paper proposes an improved double quintic polynomial approach for safe and
efficient lane-changing in mixed traffic environments. The proposed method
integrates a time-to-collision (TTC) based evaluation mechanism directly into
the trajectory optimization process, ensuring that the ego vehicle proactively
maintains a safe gap from surrounding HDVs throughout the maneuver. The
framework comprises state estimation for both the autonomous vehicle (AV) and
HDVs, trajectory generation using double quintic polynomials, real-time TTC
computation, and adaptive trajectory evaluation. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first work to embed an analytic TTC penalty directly into the
closed-form double-quintic polynomial solver, enabling real-time safety-aware
trajectory generation without post-hoc validation. Extensive simulations
conducted under diverse traffic scenarios demonstrate the safety, efficiency,
and comfort of the proposed approach compared to conventional methods such as
quintic polynomials, Bezier curves, and B-splines. The results highlight that
the improved method not only avoids collisions but also ensures smooth
transitions and adaptive decision-making in dynamic environments. This work

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring VRU safety in dynamic and unpredictable environments remains a critical and unresolved challenge in the autonomous driving domain.

Method: The researchers employed the Vehicle in Virtual Environment (VVE) method to apply automated steering and braking systems for VRUs.

Result: The study improved upon previous year's results and incorporated safety considerations specifically for bicyclists.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrated advancement in collision avoidance and safety for Vulnerable Road Users, including bicyclists.

Abstract: Extensive research has already been conducted in the autonomous driving field
to help vehicles navigate safely and efficiently. At the same time, plenty of
current research on vulnerable road user (VRU) safety is performed which
largely concentrates on perception, localization, or trajectory prediction of
VRUs. However, existing research still exhibits several gaps, including the
lack of a unified planning and collision avoidance system for autonomous
vehicles, limited investigation into delay tolerant control strategies, and the
absence of an efficient and standardized testing methodology. Ensuring VRU
safety remains one of the most pressing challenges in autonomous driving,
particularly in dynamic and unpredictable environments. In this two year
project, we focused on applying the Vehicle in Virtual Environment (VVE) method
to develop, evaluate, and demonstrate safety functions for Vulnerable Road
Users (VRUs) using automated steering and braking of ADS. In this current
second year project report, our primary focus was on enhancing the previous
year results while also considering bicyclist safety.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a QP-MPC-based trajectory planning framework for autonomous vehicles that enhances safety, efficiency, and comfort using a novel dynamic hazard field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous vehicles require advanced trajectory planning for safe, efficient, and stable performance in dynamic environments; existing methods face challenges like high computational costs and limited validation.

Method: The framework integrates a dynamic hazard field into the QP-MPC cost function, incorporates quintic polynomial sampling for comfort, and employs sub-rewards for efficiency, validated in complex tasks.

Result: Simulations show that the framework outperforms existing optimization methods in scenarios like lane-changing, overtaking, and intersection crossing.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively balances multiple objectives and demonstrates superior performance in diverse driving scenarios, addressing limitations of existing trajectory planning methods.

Abstract: Trajectory planning is a critical component in ensuring the safety,
stability, and efficiency of autonomous vehicles. While existing trajectory
planning methods have achieved progress, they often suffer from high
computational costs, unstable performance in dynamic environments, and limited
validation across diverse scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we propose
an enhanced QP-MPC-based framework that incorporates three key innovations: (i)
a novel cost function designed with a dynamic hazard field, which explicitly
balances safety, efficiency, and comfort; (ii) seamless integration of this
cost function into the QP-MPC formulation, enabling direct optimization of
desired driving behaviors; and (iii) extensive validation of the proposed
framework across complex tasks. The spatial safe planning is guided by a
dynamic hazard field (DHF) for risk assessment, while temporal safe planning is
based on a space-time graph. Besides, the quintic polynomial sampling and
sub-reward of comforts are used to ensure comforts during lane-changing. The
sub-reward of efficiency is used to maintain driving efficiency. Finally, the
proposed DHF-enhanced objective function integrates multiple objectives,
providing a proper optimization tasks for QP-MPC. Extensive simulations
demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms benchmark optimization
methods in terms of efficiency, stability, and comfort across a variety of
scenarios likes lane-changing, overtaking, and crossing intersections.

Method: The authors designed and implemented CARIS, a system integrating teleoperation, human perception, dialogue capabilities, and multimodal data recording. They tested its application in two pilot use-cases: mental health companion and tour guide.

Result: CARIS successfully controlled a robot in these two scenarios, demonstrating its adaptability. However, the study identified areas for improvement, such as smoother integration between functionalities and better usability features.

Conclusion: CARIS represents a publicly available tool that aids researchers in studying intelligent robot behavior in varied contexts, potentially broadening the scope and applicability of HRI studies.

Abstract: The human-robot interaction (HRI) field has traditionally used Wizard-of-Oz
(WoZ) controlled robots to explore navigation, conversational dynamics,
human-in-the-loop interactions, and more to explore appropriate robot behaviors
in everyday settings. However, existing WoZ tools are often limited to one
context, making them less adaptable across different settings, users, and
robotic platforms. To mitigate these issues, we introduce a Context-Adaptable
Robot Interface System (CARIS) that combines advanced robotic capabilities such
teleoperation, human perception, human-robot dialogue, and multimodal data
recording. Through pilot studies, we demonstrate the potential of CARIS to WoZ
control a robot in two contexts: 1) mental health companion and as a 2) tour
guide. Furthermore, we identified areas of improvement for CARIS, including
smoother integration between movement and communication, clearer functionality
separation, recommended prompts, and one-click communication options to enhance
the usability wizard control of CARIS. This project offers a publicly

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in solving the inverse kinematics of specific 6-DOF robot manipulators by expanding applicability to manipulators with intersections of any two consecutive rotational joint axes.

Method: The method employs the Comprehensive Gröbner System (CGS) to avoid repetitive calculations related to joint parameters and facilitates efficient computation of inverse kinematics for broader manipulator configurations.

Result: The proposed approach is verified to solve inverse kinematics for a wider range of 6-DOF manipulators, demonstrating its computational efficiency and expanded applicability.

Conclusion: Extending the inverse kinematics solution method to general manipulators improves efficiency and broadens applicability, addressing design constraints more effectively.

Abstract: We propose an effective method for solving the inverse kinematic problem of a
specific model of 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) robot manipulator using computer
algebra. It is known that when the rotation axes of three consecutive
rotational joints of a manipulator intersect at a single point, the inverse
kinematics problem can be divided into determining position and orientation. We
extend this method to more general manipulators in which the rotational axes of
two consecutive joints intersect. This extension broadens the class of 6-DOF
manipulators for which the inverse kinematics problem can be solved, and is
expected to enable more efficient solutions. The inverse kinematic problem is
solved using the Comprehensive Gr\"obner System (CGS) with joint parameters of
the robot appearing as parameters in the coefficients to prevent repetitive
calculations of the Gr\"obner bases. The effectiveness of the proposed method
is shown by experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency and accuracy of motion planning for 6-DOF robot manipulators, addressing the challenges in trajectory and joint configuration optimization.

Method: The method involves (1) calculating the feasible manipulator region, (2) determining a trajectory and joint configurations for the end-effector on given line segments, and (3) optimizing inverse kinematics through Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest paths.

Result: The proposed framework successfully optimizes path planning for the manipulator, as demonstrated in experiments.

Conclusion: The approach effectively computes optimal paths for 6-DOF robot manipulators, offering practical benefits in motion planning.

Abstract: An effective method for optimizing path planning for a specific model of a
6-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) robot manipulator is presented as part of the
motion planning of the manipulator using computer algebra. We assume that we
are given a path in the form of a set of line segments that the end-effector
should follow. We also assume that we have a method to solve the inverse
kinematic problem of the manipulator at each via-point of the trajectory. The
proposed method consists of three steps. First, we calculate the feasible
region of the manipulator under a specific configuration of the end-effector.
Next, we aim to find a trajectory on the line segments and a sequence of joint
configurations the manipulator should follow to move the end-effector along the
specified trajectory. Finally, we find the optimal combination of solutions to
the inverse kinematic problem at each via-point along the trajectory by
reducing the problem to a shortest-path problem of the graph and applying

*Yulin Li,Tetsuro Miyazaki,Kenji Kawashima*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel motion planning framework integrating Configuration Space Distance Fields (CDFs) with Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control, achieving efficient and successful collision avoidance for robotic manipulators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical optimization-based motion planning methods suffer from local minima and issues with vanishing SDF gradients, and gradient-free approaches like MPPI are computationally expensive and challenging to design. Addressing these limitations, this work aims to improve efficiency and reliability in collision-avoidance algorithms.

Method: The framework integrates CDFs with MPPI to operate in the robot's configuration space. By leveraging the differentiability of CDF gradients, the MPPI cost is unified in joint space, and the planning horizon is reduced to one step for computational efficiency without sacrificing collision avoidance.

Result: The proposed approach achieves nearly 100% success in 2D environments and consistently high performance in 7-DOF Franka manipulator simulations with complex obstacles. It also achieves control frequencies over 750 Hz, outperforming traditional optimization-based methods and standard MPPI baselines.

Conclusion: The CDF-MPPI framework is an effective and efficient solution for motion planning in high-dimensional spaces, demonstrating both reliability and speed, making it suitable for real-world robotic applications.

Abstract: Motion planning for robotic manipulators is a fundamental problem in
robotics. Classical optimization-based methods typically rely on the gradients
of signed distance fields (SDFs) to impose collision-avoidance constraints.
However, these methods are susceptible to local minima and may fail when the
SDF gradients vanish. Recently, Configuration Space Distance Fields (CDFs) have
been introduced, which directly model distances in the robot's configuration
space. Unlike workspace SDFs, CDFs are differentiable almost everywhere and
thus provide reliable gradient information. On the other hand, gradient-free
approaches such as Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control leverage
long-horizon rollouts to achieve collision avoidance. While effective, these
methods are computationally expensive due to the large number of trajectory
samples, repeated collision checks, and the difficulty of designing cost
functions with heterogeneous physical units. In this paper, we propose a
framework that integrates CDFs with MPPI to enable direct navigation in the
robot's configuration space. Leveraging CDF gradients, we unify the MPPI cost
in joint-space and reduce the horizon to one step, substantially cutting
computation while preserving collision avoidance in practice. We demonstrate
that our approach achieves nearly 100% success rates in 2D environments and
consistently high success rates in challenging 7-DOF Franka manipulator
simulations with complex obstacles. Furthermore, our method attains control
frequencies exceeding 750 Hz, substantially outperforming both
optimization-based and standard MPPI baselines. These results highlight the
effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed CDF-MPPI framework for
high-dimensional motion planning.

propose a quantitative driving style representation that maps abstract traits
to parameters such as speed, safety factors, and reaction time. These
parameters are embedded into the MFG through a spatial influence field model.
To ensure safe operation in dense traffic, we introduce a safety-critical
lane-changing algorithm that leverages dynamic safety margins,
time-to-collision analysis, and multi-layered constraints. Real-world NGSIM
data is employed for style calibration and empirical validation. Experimental
results demonstrate zero collisions across six style combinations, two
15-vehicle scenarios, and NGSIM-based trials, consistently outperforming
conventional game-theoretic baselines. Overall, our approach provides a
scalable, interpretable, and behavior-aware planning framework for real-world

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for fast and reactive grasping in multi-DoF systems by combining velocity fields with joint-space QP to enable collision-free real-time planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-DoF systems face challenges in real-time collision-free motion planning due to the combinatorial explosion of planning search space.

Method: The authors combine task-space velocity field planning with a joint-space QP solution in a hierarchical structure to achieve global task planning and local joint tracking.

Result: Simulation and tests demonstrated the approach's ability for real-time, collision-free motions in high-DoF systems, coping with dynamic environments and disturbances.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively handles high-DoF systems for adaptive, real-time grasping while maintaining constraints and priorities.

Abstract: We present a fast and reactive grasping framework for multi-DoF grippers that
combines task-space velocity fields with a joint-space Quadratic Program (QP)
in a hierarchical structure. Reactive, collision-free global motion planning is
particularly challenging for high-DoF systems, since simultaneous increases in
state dimensionality and planning horizon trigger a combinatorial explosion of
the search space, making real-time planning intractable. To address this, we
plan globally in a lower-dimensional task space, such as fingertip positions,
and track locally in the full joint space while enforcing all constraints. This
approach is realized by constructing velocity fields in multiple task-space
coordinates (or in some cases a subset of joint coordinates) and solving a
weighted joint-space QP to compute joint velocities that track these fields
with appropriately assigned priorities. Through simulation experiments with
privileged knowledge and real-world tests using the recent pose-tracking
algorithm FoundationPose, we verify that our method enables high-DoF arm-hand
systems to perform real-time, collision-free reaching motions while adapting to
dynamic environments and external disturbances.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges of uncertain and nonlinear motion in soft robots due to their inherent flexibility, which limits the effectiveness of deterministic models and open-loop control methods.

Method: FPE-based Model Predictive Control (FPE-MPC) using the Fokker-Planck Equation to manage probabilistic distributions of soft robot states.

Result: Two numerical simulation case studies validate the effectiveness of FPE-MPC in managing uncertainties in a soft robotic finger.

Conclusion: FPE-MPC demonstrates potential for controlling flexible and uncertain systems in soft robotics through stochastic methods, overcoming limitations of traditional deterministic approaches.

Abstract: The inherent flexibility of soft robots offers numerous advantages, such as
enhanced adaptability and improved safety. However, this flexibility can also
introduce challenges regarding highly uncertain and nonlinear motion. These
challenges become particularly problematic when using open-loop control
methods, which lack a feedback mechanism and are commonly employed in soft
robot control. Though one potential solution is model-based control, typical
deterministic models struggle with uncertainty as mentioned above. The idea is
to use the Fokker-Planck Equation (FPE), a master equation of a stochastic
process, to control not the state of soft robots but the probabilistic
distribution. In this study, we propose and implement a stochastic-based
control strategy, termed FPE-based Model Predictive Control (FPE-MPC), for a
soft robotic finger. Two numerical simulation case studies examine the
performance and characteristics of this control method, revealing its efficacy
in managing the uncertainty inherent in soft robotic systems.

Motivation: Address the challenges in feature-based SLAM caused by inconsistent feature quality and quantity across diverse environments.

Method: Introduced scene reliability assessment to guide behavior, adaptive region selection, self-adjusting clustering for dynamic feature removal, reliability-aware pose refinement, and keyframe selection.

Result: SRR-SLAM outperformed state-of-the-art dynamic SLAM methods, achieving up to 90% accuracy and robustness improvements in experiments.

Conclusion: SRR-SLAM effectively tackles environmental variability, improving navigation precision and robustness for autonomous robotics.

Abstract: Visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) plays a critical role in
autonomous robotic systems, especially where accurate and reliable measurements
are essential for navigation and sensing. In feature-based SLAM, the
quantityand quality of extracted features significantly influence system
performance. Due to the variations in feature quantity and quality across
diverse environments, current approaches face two major challenges: (1) limited
adaptability in dynamic feature culling and pose estimation, and (2)
insufficient environmental awareness in assessment and optimization strategies.
To address these issues, we propose SRR-SLAM, a scene-reliability based
framework that enhances feature-based SLAM through environment-aware
processing. Our method introduces a unified scene reliability assessment
mechanism that incorporates multiple metrics and historical observations to
guide system behavior. Based on this assessment, we develop: (i) adaptive
dynamic region selection with flexible geometric constraints, (ii)
depth-assisted self-adjusting clustering for efficient dynamic feature removal
in high-dimensional settings, and (iii) reliability-aware pose refinement that
dynamically integrates direct methods when features are insufficient.
Furthermore, we propose (iv) reliability-based keyframe selection and a
weighted optimization scheme to reduce computational overhead while improving
estimation accuracy. Extensive experiments on public datasets and real world
scenarios show that SRR-SLAM outperforms state-of-the-art dynamic SLAM methods,
achieving up to 90% improvement in accuracy and robustness across diverse
environments. These improvements directly contribute to enhanced measurement
precision and reliability in autonomous robotic sensing systems.

Motivation: Soft robots face challenges in real-time control due to their continuous deformation and limitations of existing models in computational efficiency and parameter complexity.

Method: The authors introduce PRBM plus LDM, combining Pseudo-Rigid Body Modeling and Logarithmic Decrement Method, to model soft robotic hand dynamics. The approach was implemented for position and force control benchmark tests.

Result: The PRBM plus LDM technique demonstrated lower position errors compared to PID controllers and superior grasping force regulation in delicate object handling.

Conclusion: PRBM plus LDM provides a computationally efficient solution for enhancing the precision and adaptability of soft robot actuators, facilitating stable grasping and force control.

Abstract: The rapid advancement in physical human-robot interaction (HRI) has
accelerated the development of soft robot designs and controllers. Controlling
soft robots, especially soft hand grasping, is challenging due to their
continuous deformation, motivating the use of reduced model-based controllers
for real-time dynamic performance. Most existing models, however, suffer from
computational inefficiency and complex parameter identification, limiting their
real-time applicability. To address this, we propose a paradigm coupling
Pseudo-Rigid Body Modeling with the Logarithmic Decrement Method for parameter
estimation (PRBM plus LDM). Using a soft robotic hand test bed, we validate
PRBM plus LDM for predicting position and force output from pressure input and
benchmark its performance. We then implement PRBM plus LDM as the basis for
closed-loop position and force controllers. Compared to a simple PID
controller, the PRBM plus LDM position controller achieves lower error (average
maximum error across all fingers: 4.37 degrees versus 20.38 degrees). For force
control, PRBM plus LDM outperforms constant pressure grasping in pinching tasks
on delicate objects: potato chip 86 versus 82.5, screwdriver 74.42 versus 70,
brass coin 64.75 versus 35. These results demonstrate PRBM plus LDM as a
computationally efficient and accurate modeling technique for soft actuators,
enabling stable and flexible grasping with precise force regulation.

Motivation: To improve the functionality of soft robots used in rehabilitation, addressing issues like slow response, limited motion range, low force outputs, and lack of effective position/force controls.

Method: The study proposes two actuators: the Lobster-Inspired Silicone Pneumatic Robot (LISPER) and the Scallop-Shaped Pneumatic Robot (SCASPER). Analytical models describe the pressure-to-force relationships, and a dummy arm test demonstrates feasibility.

Result: Two actuators were developed with notable improvements in force, torque, and motion control. Analytical models were validated, and the dummy arm test showed promising results.

Conclusion: The LISPER and SCASPER actuators demonstrate potential as effective components in soft robotic rehabilitation, offering better precision, output, and adaptability compared to previous designs.

Abstract: Soft robots have been increasingly utilized as sophisticated tools in
physical rehabilitation, particularly for assisting patients with neuromotor
impairments. However, many soft robotics for rehabilitation applications are
characterized by limitations such as slow response times, restricted range of
motion, and low output force. There are also limited studies on the precise
position and force control of wearable soft actuators. Furthermore, not many
studies articulate how bellow-structured actuator designs quantitatively
contribute to the robots' capability. This study introduces a paradigm of upper
limb soft actuator design. This paradigm comprises two actuators: the
Lobster-Inspired Silicone Pneumatic Robot (LISPER) for the elbow and the
Scallop-Shaped Pneumatic Robot (SCASPER) for the shoulder. LISPER is
characterized by higher bandwidth, increased output force/torque, and high
linearity. SCASPER is characterized by high output force/torque and simplified
fabrication processes. Comprehensive analytical models that describe the
relationship between pressure, bending angles, and output force for both
actuators were presented so the geometric configuration of the actuators can be
set to modify the range of motion and output forces. The preliminary test on a
dummy arm is conducted to test the capability of the actuators.

*Nouhed Naidja,Stéphane Font,Marc Revilloud,Guillaume Sandou*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework to optimize autonomous vehicle trajectories with respect to safety, comfort, and efficiency using geometric indicators and PSO-based optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a system for evaluating and improving autonomous vehicle trajectories based on formal metrics of safety, comfort, and efficiency.

Method: The study employs geometric indicators, adaptive ellipses for collision risk analysis, the Shoelace formula for intersection area computation, comfort metrics from jerk analysis, and optimization using a PSO algorithm.

Result: The method was validated in real-world traffic situations and simulations, showing effective optimization for autonomous vehicle operation.

Conclusion: The proposed framework integrates quantitative criteria and delivers practical improvements in trajectory optimization for autonomous vehicles.

Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework for the evaluation and optimization
of autonomous vehicle trajectories, integrating formal safety, comfort, and
efficiency criteria. An innovative geometric indicator, based on the analysis
of safety zones using adaptive ellipses, is used to accurately quantify
collision risks. Our method applies the Shoelace formula to compute the
intersection area in the case of misaligned and time-varying configurations.
Comfort is modeled using indicators centered on longitudinal and lateral jerk,
while efficiency is assessed by overall travel time. These criteria are
aggregated into a comprehensive objective function solved using a PSO based
algorithm. The approach was successfully validated under real traffic
conditions via experiments conducted in an urban intersection involving an
autonomous vehicle interacting with a human-operated vehicle, and in simulation
using data recorded from human driving in real traffic.

### [729] [Disentangled Multi-Context Meta-Learning: Unlocking robust and Generalized Task Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01297)
*Seonsoo Kim,Jun-Gill Kang,Taehong Kim,Seongil Hong*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a disentangled multi-context meta-learning framework to separate task factors into distinct context vectors, improving task understanding and generalization. The method is evaluated on sinusoidal regression and quadruped robot locomotion tasks, showcasing out-of-distribution robustness and sim-to-real transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Meta-learning often involves mixed representations that hinder interpretability and generalization. The authors aim to address this issue by disentangling task variations into separate factors.

Method: The proposed framework assigns distinct context vectors to different task factors, enabling factor decoupling and context sharing across tasks. It applies this framework to a sinusoidal regression task and a quadruped robot locomotion task.

Result: The approach demonstrated enhanced generalization on unseen tasks, improved out-of-distribution robustness, and successful sim-to-real transfer for complex terrains with limited real-world data.

Conclusion: Multi-context disentanglement in meta-learning improves robustness, generalization, and data efficiency, making it a practical solution for handling diverse task factors in downstream applications.

Abstract: In meta-learning and its downstream tasks, many methods rely on implicit
adaptation to task variations, where multiple factors are mixed together in a
single entangled representation. This makes it difficult to interpret which
factors drive performance and can hinder generalization. In this work, we
introduce a disentangled multi-context meta-learning framework that explicitly
assigns each task factor to a distinct context vector. By decoupling these
variations, our approach improves robustness through deeper task understanding
and enhances generalization by enabling context vector sharing across tasks
with shared factors. We evaluate our approach in two domains. First, on a
sinusoidal regression task, our model outperforms baselines on
out-of-distribution tasks and generalizes to unseen sine functions by sharing
context vectors associated with shared amplitudes or phase shifts. Second, in a
quadruped robot locomotion task, we disentangle the robot-specific properties
and the characteristics of the terrain in the robot dynamics model. By
transferring disentangled context vectors acquired from the dynamics model into
reinforcement learning, the resulting policy achieves improved robustness under
out-of-distribution conditions, surpassing the baselines that rely on a single
unified context. Furthermore, by effectively sharing context, our model enables
successful sim-to-real policy transfer to challenging terrains with
out-of-distribution robot-specific properties, using just 20 seconds of real
data from flat terrain, a result not achievable with single-task adaptation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This study introduces TopoNav, a framework using topological graphs as spatial memory, achieving state-of-the-art ObjectNav performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object navigation struggles with memory management, especially in long-horizon tasks and dynamic environments.

Method: TopoNav uses topological graphs to model scene connections, adjacency, and semantics for spatial understanding and effective reasoning.

Result: TopoNav sets new state-of-the-art benchmarks with higher success rates and efficient navigation paths in ObjectNav tasks.

Conclusion: Integrating topological structures into spatial memory significantly enhances navigation performance, particularly in complex environments.

Abstract: Object Navigation (ObjectNav) has made great progress with large language
models (LLMs), but still faces challenges in memory management, especially in
long-horizon tasks and dynamic scenes. To address this, we propose TopoNav, a
new framework that leverages topological structures as spatial memory. By
building and updating a topological graph that captures scene connections,
adjacency, and semantic meaning, TopoNav helps agents accumulate spatial
knowledge over time, retrieve key information, and reason effectively toward
distant goals. Our experiments show that TopoNav achieves state-of-the-art
performance on benchmark ObjectNav datasets, with higher success rates and more
efficient paths. It particularly excels in diverse and complex environments, as
it connects temporary visual inputs with lasting spatial understanding.

TL;DR: This paper studies how assistance impacts human-robot collaboration (HRC), analyzing user preferences and experiences with human and non-human assisting agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve human-robot collaboration in industrial tasks by understanding user needs and preferences for assistance from agents during these scenarios.

Method: A user study was conducted to collect quantitative and qualitative data, examining users' experiences and perceptions of soliciting and receiving assistance (either human or artificial, on-demand or unsolicited).

Result: The study highlights the emotional responses, productivity levels, and user preferences when designing assisting agents for HRC tasks.

Conclusion: Insights from the study guide the design of effective assisting agents (human or artificial) for future HRC scenarios, addressing preferences for on-demand versus unsolicited assistance.

Abstract: As robot technology advances, collaboration between humans and robots will
become more prevalent in industrial tasks. When humans run into issues in such
scenarios, a likely future involves relying on artificial agents or robots for
aid. This study identifies key aspects for the design of future user-assisting
agents. We analyze quantitative and qualitative data from a user study
examining the impact of on-demand assistance received from a remote human in a
human-robot collaboration (HRC) assembly task. We study scenarios in which
users require help and we assess their experiences in requesting and receiving
assistance. Additionally, we investigate participants' perceptions of future
non-human assisting agents and whether assistance should be on-demand or
unsolicited. Through a user study, we analyze the impact that such design
decisions (human or artificial assistant, on-demand or unsolicited help) can
have on elicited emotional responses, productivity, and preferences of humans
engaged in HRC tasks.

*Fan Zhu,Yifan Zhao,Ziyu Chen,Biao Yu,Hui Zhu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The authors present FGO-SLAM, a Gaussian SLAM system using an opacity radiance field to improve mapping and pose optimization, achieving state-of-the-art results in diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional SLAM methods fail to achieve high-quality scene reconstruction, and Gaussian SLAM lacks effective pose optimization and geometric reconstruction capabilities.

Method: FGO-SLAM introduces an opacity radiance field for scene representation, performs global pose adjustment and tracking, utilizes 3D Gaussians for consistency, and employs level sets to extract surfaces after constructing tetrahedral grids.

Result: The proposed method delivers state-of-the-art tracking accuracy and mapping performance on various real-world and synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: FGO-SLAM effectively addresses the limitations of traditional and Gaussian SLAM systems, providing superior performance in tracking and mapping for various applications.

Abstract: Visual SLAM has regained attention due to its ability to provide perceptual
capabilities and simulation test data for Embodied AI. However, traditional
SLAM methods struggle to meet the demands of high-quality scene reconstruction,
and Gaussian SLAM systems, despite their rapid rendering and high-quality
mapping capabilities, lack effective pose optimization methods and face
challenges in geometric reconstruction. To address these issues, we introduce
FGO-SLAM, a Gaussian SLAM system that employs an opacity radiance field as the
scene representation to enhance geometric mapping performance. After initial
pose estimation, we apply global adjustment to optimize camera poses and sparse
point cloud, ensuring robust tracking of our approach. Additionally, we
maintain a globally consistent opacity radiance field based on 3D Gaussians and
introduce depth distortion and normal consistency terms to refine the scene
representation. Furthermore, after constructing tetrahedral grids, we identify
level sets to directly extract surfaces from 3D Gaussians. Results across
various real-world and large-scale synthetic datasets demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art tracking accuracy and mapping performance.

### [733] [Aleatoric Uncertainty from AI-based 6D Object Pose Predictors for Object-relative State Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01583)
*Thomas Jantos,Stephan Weiss,Jan Steinbrener*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to extend deep learning-based object-relative pose predictors to infer aleatoric uncertainty, facilitating improved state estimation in robotics tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In robotics, accurately estimating uncertainty in deep learning-based measurements, such as object-relative pose predictions, is critical for enhancing the reliability of probabilistic state estimators.

Method: The authors propose adding two detached multi-layer perceptrons to existing pose predictors for aleatoric uncertainty inference. This method allows efficient training by freezing the pre-trained predictor and incurs minimal computational overhead.

Result: The inferred pose and uncertainty are integrated into an extended Kalman filter for state estimation, showing improved performance compared to fixed-covariance approaches in both synthetic and real-world evaluations.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances object-relative state estimation by dynamically inferring measurement uncertainty, making it suitable for deployment on edge devices with minimal computational costs.

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) has become essential in various robotics applications due
to excelling at processing raw sensory data to extract task specific
information from semantic objects. For example, vision-based object-relative
navigation relies on a DL-based 6D object pose predictor to provide the
relative pose between the object and the robot as measurements to the robot's
state estimator. Accurately knowing the uncertainty inherent in such Deep
Neural Network (DNN) based measurements is essential for probabilistic state
estimators subsequently guiding the robot's tasks. Thus, in this letter, we
show that we can extend any existing DL-based object-relative pose predictor
for aleatoric uncertainty inference simply by including two multi-layer
perceptrons detached from the translational and rotational part of the DL
predictor. This allows for efficient training while freezing the existing
pre-trained predictor. We then use the inferred 6D pose and its uncertainty as
a measurement and corresponding noise covariance matrix in an extended Kalman
filter (EKF). Our approach induces minimal computational overhead such that the
state estimator can be deployed on edge devices while benefiting from the
dynamically inferred measurement uncertainty. This increases the performance of
the object-relative state estimation task compared to a fix-covariance
approach. We conduct evaluations on synthetic data and real-world data to
underline the benefits of aleatoric uncertainty inference for the
object-relative state estimation task.

*Ziteng Gao,Jiaqi Qu,Chaoyu Chen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This study proposes a deep reinforcement learning algorithm to improve autonomous vehicle lane changing by combining multi-modal data with surrounding vehicle trajectory predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous lane changing requires balancing safety and efficiency, and current methods struggle to fully utilize environmental data for decision-making.

Method: The paper introduces a DRL algorithm that integrates surrounding vehicle trajectory predictions and multi-modal environmental data, combining reinforcement learning decisions with end-to-end vehicle control for holistic lane change processes.

Result: Experiments in CARLA showed improved lane change safety through the use of hybrid input state spaces.

Conclusion: The hybrid state space approach successfully enhances the rationality and safety of lane change decisions for autonomous vehicles.

Abstract: Lane change decision-making for autonomous vehicles is a complex but
high-reward behavior. In this paper, we propose a hybrid input based deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm, which realizes abstract lane change
decisions and lane change actions for autonomous vehicles within traffic flow.
Firstly, a surrounding vehicles trajectory prediction method is proposed to
reduce the risk of future behavior of surrounding vehicles to ego vehicle, and
the prediction results are input into the reinforcement learning model as
additional information. Secondly, to comprehensively leverage environmental
information, the model extracts feature from high-dimensional images and
low-dimensional sensor data simultaneously. The fusion of surrounding vehicle
trajectory prediction and multi-modal information are used as state space of
reinforcement learning to improve the rationality of lane change decision.
Finally, we integrate reinforcement learning macro decisions with end-to-end
vehicle control to achieve a holistic lane change process. Experiments were
conducted within the CARLA simulator, and the results demonstrated that the
utilization of a hybrid state space significantly enhances the safety of
vehicle lane change decisions.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper explores prospective designs and discussions about robots tailored for and by LGBTQ+ communities, aiming to contribute to queer robotics futures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To initiate dialogue on how robots can be designed for and represent LGBTQ+ populations, reflecting their identities and aspirations while addressing challenges like bigotry and resource sharing.

Method: The authors review existing works on queer robotics in fiction and science and propose three speculative queer robot roles addressing identity reflection, queer activism, and resource-sharing networks.

Result: The study provides thought experiments and speculative proposals, but does not include empirical data or implementations, focusing instead on conceptual frameworks for queer robotics.

Conclusion: Robots can potentially support queer identities, activism, and resources. However, the paper emphasizes that ethical considerations remain critical in queering robotics.

Abstract: This paper examines the speculative topic of equitable robots through an
exploratory essay format. It focuses specifically on robots by and for LGBTQ+
populations. It aims to provoke thought and conversations in the field about
what aspirational queer robotics futures may look like, both in the arts and
sciences. First, it briefly reviews the state-of-the-art of queer robotics in
fiction and science, drawing together threads from each. Then, it discusses
queering robots through three speculative design proposals for queer robot
roles: 1) reflecting the queerness of their ''in-group'' queer users, building
and celebrating ''in-group'' identity, 2) a new kind of queer activism by
implementing queer robot identity performance to interact with ''out-group''
users, with a goal of reducing bigotry through familiarisation, and 3) a
network of queer-owned robots, through which the community could reach each
other, and distribute and access important resources. The paper then questions
whether robots should be queered, and what ethical implications this raises.
Finally, the paper makes suggestions for what aspirational queer robotics
futures may look like, and what would be required to get there.

### [736] [Data Retrieval with Importance Weights for Few-Shot Imitation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01657)
*Amber Xie,Rahul Chand,Dorsa Sadigh,Joey Hejna*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Importance Weighted Retrieval (IWR), an enhanced method for few-shot imitation learning, leveraging Gaussian KDEs for more accurate data selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few-shot imitation learning is crucial for deploying robots in new environments, but existing retrieval-based methods have limitations in data selection accuracy.

Method: The authors propose IWR, which uses Gaussian kernel density estimates to compute importance weights for data retrieval, addressing biases and noise in previous methods.

Result: Experiments on simulation environments and real-world datasets show consistent performance improvements using IWR compared to prior retrieval-based methods.

Conclusion: IWR mitigates biases and noise issues inherent in earlier data selection rules, offering a more reliable approach for few-shot imitation learning.

Abstract: While large-scale robot datasets have propelled recent progress in imitation
learning, learning from smaller task specific datasets remains critical for
deployment in new environments and unseen tasks. One such approach to few-shot
imitation learning is retrieval-based imitation learning, which extracts
relevant samples from large, widely available prior datasets to augment a
limited demonstration dataset. To determine the relevant data from prior
datasets, retrieval-based approaches most commonly calculate a prior data
point's minimum distance to a point in the target dataset in latent space.
While retrieval-based methods have shown success using this metric for data
selection, we demonstrate its equivalence to the limit of a Gaussian kernel
density (KDE) estimate of the target data distribution. This reveals two
shortcomings of the retrieval rule used in prior work. First, it relies on
high-variance nearest neighbor estimates that are susceptible to noise. Second,
it does not account for the distribution of prior data when retrieving data. To
address these issues, we introduce Importance Weighted Retrieval (IWR), which
estimates importance weights, or the ratio between the target and prior data
distributions for retrieval, using Gaussian KDEs. By considering the
probability ratio, IWR seeks to mitigate the bias of previous selection rules,
and by using reasonable modeling parameters, IWR effectively smooths estimates
using all data points. Across both simulation environments and real-world
evaluations on the Bridge dataset we find that our method, IWR, consistently
improves performance of existing retrieval-based methods, despite only
requiring minor modifications.

*Zhenyu Wu,Angyuan Ma,Xiuwei Xu,Hang Yin,Yinan Liang,Ziwei Wang,Jiwen Lu,Haibin Yan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces MoTo, a plug-in module enhancing manipulation foundation models for mobile manipulation tasks, achieving superior zero-shot performance without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address limitations in generalization across tasks and environments for mobile manipulation in robotics, leveraging advancements in manipulation foundation models designed for fixed-base settings.

Method: MoTo utilizes interaction-aware navigation policies, interaction keypoints via vision-language models for multi-view consistency, and motion planning objectives to integrate with manipulation models, enabling zero-shot mobile manipulation capability.

Result: The module demonstrates higher success rates in extensive experiments on OVMM and real-world setups, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 2.68% and 16.67%, respectively, without additional data.

Conclusion: MoTo provides a scalable solution for zero-shot mobile manipulation by combining existing models with robust integration frameworks, improving generalization and practicality.

Abstract: Mobile manipulation stands as a core challenge in robotics, enabling robots
to assist humans across varied tasks and dynamic daily environments.
Conventional mobile manipulation approaches often struggle to generalize across
different tasks and environments due to the lack of large-scale training.
However, recent advances in manipulation foundation models demonstrate
impressive generalization capability on a wide range of fixed-base manipulation
tasks, which are still limited to a fixed setting. Therefore, we devise a
plug-in module named MoTo, which can be combined with any off-the-shelf
manipulation foundation model to empower them with mobile manipulation ability.
Specifically, we propose an interaction-aware navigation policy to generate
robot docking points for generalized mobile manipulation. To enable zero-shot
ability, we propose an interaction keypoints framework via vision-language
models (VLM) under multi-view consistency for both target object and robotic
arm following instructions, where fixed-base manipulation foundation models can
be employed. We further propose motion planning objectives for the mobile base
and robot arm, which minimize the distance between the two keypoints and
maintain the physical feasibility of trajectories. In this way, MoTo guides the
robot to move to the docking points where fixed-base manipulation can be
successfully performed, and leverages VLM generation and trajectory
optimization to achieve mobile manipulation in a zero-shot manner, without any
requirement on mobile manipulation expert data. Extensive experimental results
on OVMM and real-world demonstrate that MoTo achieves success rates of 2.68%
and 16.67% higher than the state-of-the-art mobile manipulation methods,
respectively, without requiring additional training data.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces ArtiPoint, a framework for estimating 3D motion of articulated objects in dynamic and realistic environments, and provides a new dataset, Arti4D, for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of effective methods for estimating articulation in realistic, unconstrained environments with dynamic cameras and partial observability.

Method: Combines deep point tracking with a factor graph optimization framework to estimate articulated object trajectories and axes using raw RGB-D videos.

Result: ArtiPoint outperforms traditional and learning-based baselines on the newly introduced Arti4D dataset, which contains ego-centric, in-the-wild scenes.

Conclusion: ArtiPoint enables robust articulation estimation in realistic settings and introduces Arti4D to foster further research and benchmarks in this domain.

Abstract: Understanding the 3D motion of articulated objects is essential in robotic
scene understanding, mobile manipulation, and motion planning. Prior methods
for articulation estimation have primarily focused on controlled settings,
assuming either fixed camera viewpoints or direct observations of various
object states, which tend to fail in more realistic unconstrained environments.
In contrast, humans effortlessly infer articulation by watching others
manipulate objects. Inspired by this, we introduce ArtiPoint, a novel
estimation framework that can infer articulated object models under dynamic
camera motion and partial observability. By combining deep point tracking with
a factor graph optimization framework, ArtiPoint robustly estimates articulated
part trajectories and articulation axes directly from raw RGB-D videos. To
foster future research in this domain, we introduce Arti4D, the first
ego-centric in-the-wild dataset that captures articulated object interactions
at a scene level, accompanied by articulation labels and ground-truth camera
poses. We benchmark ArtiPoint against a range of classical and learning-based
baselines, demonstrating its superior performance on Arti4D. We make code and
Arti4D publicly available at https://artipoint.cs.uni-freiburg.de.

*Parv Kapoor,Akila Ganlath,Changliu Liu,Sebastian Scherer,Eunsuk Kang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a constrained decoding framework for robotic foundation models, ensuring formal safety and behavioral correctness while retaining model-agnosticism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic foundation models offer end-to-end capabilities but lack safety constraints and explicit behavioral correctness.

Method: The proposed method enforces signal temporal logic (STL) specifications during decoding without retraining the foundation models.

Result: Experimental evaluations demonstrate enhanced safety and conditional action capabilities in state-of-the-art navigation foundation models.

Conclusion: Constrained decoding ensures robots generate safe and task-compliant actions directly, improving reliability and utility without compromising generalizability.

Abstract: Recent advances in the development of robotic foundation models have led to
promising end-to-end and general-purpose capabilities in robotic systems. These
models are pretrained on vast datasets of robot trajectories to process multi-
modal inputs and directly output a sequence of action that the system then
executes in the real world. Although this approach is attractive from the
perspective of im- proved generalization across diverse tasks, these models are
still data-driven and, therefore, lack explicit notions of behavioral
correctness and safety constraints. We address these limitations by introducing
a constrained decoding framework for robotics foundation models that enforces
logical constraints on action trajec- tories in dynamical systems. Our method
ensures that generated actions provably satisfy signal temporal logic (STL)
specifications at runtime without retraining, while remaining agnostic of the
underlying foundation model. We perform com- prehensive evaluation of our
approach across state-of-the-art navigation founda- tion models and we show
that our decoding-time interventions are useful not only for filtering unsafe
actions but also for conditional action-generation. Videos available on our

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Fail2Progress enhances robot learning from failures in long-horizon tasks by efficiently generating failure-targeted datasets and fine-tuning skill effect models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots often fail in scenarios outside the training data distribution during long-horizon manipulation tasks. To improve, they need mechanisms to learn from failures efficiently.

Method: The approach generates simulation environments resembling observed failures using Stein variational inference and fine-tunes skill effect models based on these targeted datasets.

Result: Fail2Progress successfully handles mobile manipulation tasks like object transport and shelf/tabletop organization, displaying superior performance in both simulation and real-world settings compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Efficient failure-based learning methods like Fail2Progress significantly reduce failure rates and improve robotic task performance across various scenarios.

Abstract: Skill effect models for long-horizon manipulation tasks are prone to failures
in conditions not covered by training data distributions. Therefore, enabling
robots to reason about and learn from failures is necessary. We investigate the
problem of efficiently generating a dataset targeted to observed failures.
After fine-tuning a skill effect model on this dataset, we evaluate the extent
to which the model can recover from failures and minimize future failures. We
propose Fail2Progress, an approach that leverages Stein variational inference
to generate multiple simulation environments in parallel, enabling efficient
data sample generation similar to observed failures. Our method is capable of
handling several challenging mobile manipulation tasks, including transporting
multiple objects, organizing a constrained shelf, and tabletop organization.
Through large-scale simulation and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that
our approach excels at learning from failures across different numbers of
objects. Furthermore, we show that Fail2Progress outperforms several baselines.

*Skand Peri,Akhil Perincherry,Bikram Pandit,Stefan Lee*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new hyperparameter-free method for optimizing robot control to reduce energy usage without sacrificing task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robot control often involves a trade-off between task performance and energy expenditure, which can be difficult to optimize using traditional reward shaping approaches.

Method: The proposed method uses policy gradient projection inspired by multitask learning principles to minimize energy expenditure while ensuring task success.

Result: Experiments show a 64% reduction in energy usage with comparable task performance across benchmarks like DM-Control and HumanoidBench, as well as successful Sim2Real transfer on a Unitree GO2 quadruped.

Conclusion: The technique is easy to integrate into standard reinforcement learning workflows, widely applicable, and provides a reliable alternative to reward shaping for energy-efficient robot control.

Abstract: Efficient robot control often requires balancing task performance with energy
expenditure. A common approach in reinforcement learning (RL) is to penalize
energy use directly as part of the reward function. This requires carefully
tuning weight terms to avoid undesirable trade-offs where energy minimization
harms task success. In this work, we propose a hyperparameter-free gradient
optimization method to minimize energy expenditure without conflicting with
task performance. Inspired by recent works in multitask learning, our method
applies policy gradient projection between task and energy objectives to derive
policy updates that minimize energy expenditure in ways that do not impact task
performance. We evaluate this technique on standard locomotion benchmarks of
DM-Control and HumanoidBench and demonstrate a reduction of 64% energy usage
while maintaining comparable task performance. Further, we conduct experiments
on a Unitree GO2 quadruped showcasing Sim2Real transfer of energy efficient
policies. Our method is easy to implement in standard RL pipelines with minimal
code changes, is applicable to any policy gradient method, and offers a
principled alternative to reward shaping for energy efficient control policies.

Result: ManiFlow showed consistent improvements in simulations and nearly doubled success rates in real-world robotic tasks with enhanced dexterity and generalizability.

Conclusion: ManiFlow effectively enhances robot manipulation by leveraging high-dimensional multi-modal inputs for scalable skill development across diverse setups.

Abstract: This paper introduces ManiFlow, a visuomotor imitation learning policy for
general robot manipulation that generates precise, high-dimensional actions
conditioned on diverse visual, language and proprioceptive inputs. We leverage
flow matching with consistency training to enable high-quality dexterous action

efficiently, we propose DiT-X, a diffusion transformer architecture with
adaptive cross-attention and AdaLN-Zero conditioning that enables fine-grained

*Md Mahbub Alam,Jose F. Rodrigues-Jr,Gabriel Spadon*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a transformer-based framework aimed at predicting the trajectories of multiple vessels and assessing the risk of collisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve situational awareness and collision prevention by addressing the limitations of existing single-vessel-focused trajectory prediction models that neglect vessel interactions.

Method: The authors used a transformer-based model with parallel streams to encode kinematic and physical features, temporal locality via causal convolutions, spatial transformations, and hybrid positional embeddings. This system was applied to multi-vessel trajectory prediction and collision risk analysis.

Result: The model showed improved forecasting capabilities using metrics designed for multi-vessel evaluations, outperforming traditional single-vessel displacement models.

Conclusion: This framework provides a robust solution for trajectory forecasting and collision risk assessment, offering practical maritime safety insights.

Abstract: Accurate vessel trajectory prediction is essential for enhancing situational
awareness and preventing collisions. Still, existing data-driven models are
constrained mainly to single-vessel forecasting, overlooking vessel
interactions, navigation rules, and explicit collision risk assessment. We
present a transformer-based framework for multi-vessel trajectory prediction
with integrated collision risk analysis. For a given target vessel, the
framework identifies nearby vessels. It jointly predicts their future
trajectories through parallel streams encoding kinematic and derived physical
features, causal convolutions for temporal locality, spatial transformations
for positional encoding, and hybrid positional embeddings that capture both
local motion patterns and long-range dependencies. Evaluated on large-scale
real-world AIS data using joint multi-vessel metrics, the model demonstrates
superior forecasting capabilities beyond traditional single-vessel displacement
errors. By simulating interactions among predicted trajectories, the framework
further quantifies potential collision risks, offering actionable insights to
strengthen maritime safety and decision support.

need for scalable, AI-powered monitoring solutions. This paper examines the
rapid emergence of underwater AI as a major research frontier and analyzes the
factors that have transformed marine perception from a niche application into a
catalyst for AI innovation. We identify three convergent drivers: environmental
necessity for ecosystem-scale monitoring, democratization of underwater
datasets through citizen science platforms, and researcher migration from
saturated terrestrial computer vision domains. Our analysis reveals how unique
underwater challenges - turbidity, cryptic species detection, expert annotation
bottlenecks, and cross-ecosystem generalization - are driving fundamental
advances in weakly supervised learning, open-set recognition, and robust
perception under degraded conditions. We survey emerging trends in datasets,
scene understanding and 3D reconstruction, highlighting the paradigm shift from
passive observation toward AI-driven, targeted intervention capabilities. The
paper demonstrates how underwater constraints are pushing the boundaries of
foundation models, self-supervised learning, and perception, with
methodological innovations that extend far beyond marine applications to
benefit general computer vision, robotics, and environmental monitoring.

Conclusion: AutoDrive-R² enhances autonomous driving systems with advanced reasoning and self-reflection capabilities, effectively bridging perception with reliable trajectory planning.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in autonomous driving systems have
recently demonstrated transformative potential by integrating multimodal
perception with decision-making capabilities. However, the interpretability and
coherence of the decision process and the plausibility of action sequences
remain largely underexplored. To address these issues, we propose
AutoDrive-R$^2$, a novel VLA framework that enhances both reasoning and
self-reflection capabilities of autonomous driving systems through
chain-of-thought (CoT) processing and reinforcement learning (RL).
Specifically, we first propose an innovative CoT dataset named nuScenesR$^2$-6K
for supervised fine-tuning, which effectively builds cognitive bridges between
input information and output trajectories through a four-step logical chain
with self-reflection for validation. Moreover, to maximize both reasoning and
self-reflection during the RL stage, we further employ the Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm within a physics-grounded reward framework
that incorporates spatial alignment, vehicle dynamic, and temporal smoothness
criteria to ensure reliable and realistic trajectory planning. Extensive
evaluation results across both nuScenes and Waymo datasets demonstrates the
state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization capacity of our proposed
method.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for sliding mode controllers for mechanical systems on principal fiber bundles, leveraging system symmetries and analyzing stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address complexities in designing sliding mode controllers for mechanical systems with symmetries by leveraging structure and avoiding challenging coordinate choices.

Method: The method involves designing sliding mode control using reduced motion equations, constructing a sliding subgroup for control, and ensuring convergence through Lyapunov analysis for asymptotic and exponential stability.

Result: The proposed framework is applied and simulated on a rigid spacecraft and unicycle robot, demonstrating stability and effectiveness.

Conclusion: The approach reduces design complexity and provides robust stability for a class of symmetric mechanical systems, validated through theoretical and simulation results.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a framework for designing sliding mode controllers
for a class of mechanical systems with symmetry, both unconstrained and
constrained, that evolve on principal fiber bundles. Control laws are developed
based on the reduced motion equations by exploring symmetries, leading to a
sliding mode control strategy where the reaching stage is executed on the base
space, and the sliding stage is performed on the structure group. Thus, design
complexity is reduced, and difficult choices for coordinate representations
when working with a particular Lie group are avoided. For this purpose, a
sliding subgroup is constructed on the structure group based on a kinematic
controller, and the sliding variable will converge to the identity of the state
manifold upon reaching the sliding subgroup. A reaching law based on a general
sliding vector field is then designed on the base space using the local form of
the mechanical connection to drive the sliding variable to the sliding
subgroup, and its time evolution is given according to the appropriate
covariant derivative. Almost global asymptotic stability and local exponential
stability are demonstrated using a Lyapunov analysis. We apply the results to a
fully actuated system (a rigid spacecraft actuated by reaction wheels) and a
subactuated nonholonomic system (unicycle mobile robot actuated by wheels),
which is also simulated for illustration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming challenges such as depth perception issues and intention recognition limitations in VR-based multi-object teleoperation tasks.

Method: A Virtual Admittance model was used for force adjustment and trajectory optimization, while a Multimodal-CNN Network processed multimodal data like gaze and environment context to predict user intentions.

Result: User studies showed improved grasp success rates with MMIPN and better movement efficiency with the VA model, with gaze data being the most critical input.

Conclusion: Combining multimodal cues with implicit guidance significantly enhances teleoperation performance, paving the way for more intuitive human-robot interactions in VR-based tasks.

Abstract: Effective human-robot interaction (HRI) in multi-object teleoperation tasks
faces significant challenges due to perceptual ambiguities in virtual reality
(VR) environments and the limitations of single-modality intention recognition.
This paper proposes a shared control framework that combines a virtual
admittance (VA) model with a Multimodal-CNN-based Human Intention Perception
Network (MMIPN) to enhance teleoperation performance and user experience. The
VA model employs artificial potential fields to guide operators toward target
objects by adjusting admittance force and optimizing motion trajectories. MMIPN
processes multimodal inputs, including gaze movement, robot motions, and
environmental context, to estimate human grasping intentions, helping to
overcome depth perception challenges in VR. Our user study evaluated four
conditions across two factors, and the results showed that MMIPN significantly
improved grasp success rates, while the VA model enhanced movement efficiency
by reducing path lengths. Gaze data emerged as the most crucial input modality.
These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of combining multimodal cues with
implicit guidance in VR-based teleoperation, providing a robust solution for
multi-object grasping tasks and enabling more natural interactions across
various applications in the future.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents an unsupervised LiDAR odometry model designed to improve robustness under snowy conditions by introducing novel denoising and weight prediction mechanisms for real-time pose estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR odometry models struggle to perform in snowy weather due to snowflake noise and outlier points, which limits their usability in real-world scenarios.

Method: The paper introduces a Patch Spatial Measure (PSM) module for detecting sparse noise and a Patch Point Weight Predictor (PPWP) for adaptive point-wise weight assignment. These are complemented by an intensity threshold mask and multi-modal feature fusion for real-time processing.

Result: Experimental results show consistent performance in both clear and snowy conditions, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed denoising and weight adaptation strategies.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances the generalizability of LiDAR odometry models, ensuring reliability across diverse weather conditions and advancing autonomous navigation systems.

Abstract: Deep learning-based LiDAR odometry is crucial for autonomous driving and
robotic navigation, yet its performance under adverse weather, especially
snowfall, remains challenging. Existing models struggle to generalize across
conditions due to sensitivity to snow-induced noise, limiting real-world use.
In this work, we present an unsupervised LiDAR odometry model to close the gap
between clear and snowy weather conditions. Our approach focuses on effective
denoising to mitigate the impact of snowflake noise and outlier points on pose
estimation, while also maintaining computational efficiency for real-time
applications.
  To achieve this, we introduce a Patch Spatial Measure (PSM) module that
evaluates the dispersion of points within each patch, enabling effective
detection of sparse and discrete noise.
  We further propose a Patch Point Weight Predictor (PPWP) to assign adaptive
point-wise weights, enhancing their discriminative capacity within local
regions. To support real-time performance, we first apply an intensity
threshold mask to quickly suppress dense snowflake clusters near the LiDAR, and
then perform multi-modal feature fusion to refine the point-wise weight
prediction, improving overall robustness under adverse weather. Our model is
trained in clear weather conditions and rigorously tested across various
scenarios, including snowy and dynamic. Extensive experimental results confirm
the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating robust performance in both clear
and snowy weather. This advancement enhances the model's generalizability and
paves the way for more reliable autonomous systems capable of operating across
a wider range of environmental conditions.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Align-Then-stEer (ATE), a framework to efficiently adapt Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for robotic manipulation tasks differing from pre-training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language-Action models struggle to adapt efficiently to new robotic tasks or embodiments because of action distribution mismatches.

Method: ATE uses a variational autoencoder with reverse KL divergence to unify action spaces, followed by a guidance mechanism to steer fine-tuning outputs towards the target domain.

Result: ATE improves multi-task success rates in simulations by up to 9.8% and achieves a 32% success rate gain in real-world scenarios compared to baseline fine-tuning methods.

Conclusion: The framework provides a data-efficient, general solution for adapting VLA models, enhancing their practicality across diverse robotic tasks and platforms.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models pre-trained on large, diverse datasets
show remarkable potential for general-purpose robotic manipulation. However, a
primary bottleneck remains in adapting these models to downstream tasks,
especially when the robot's embodiment or the task itself differs from the
pre-training data. This discrepancy leads to a significant mismatch in action
distributions, demanding extensive data and compute for effective fine-tuning.
To address this challenge, we introduce \textbf{Align-Then-stEer
(\texttt{ATE})}, a novel, data-efficient, and plug-and-play adaptation
framework. \texttt{ATE} first aligns disparate action spaces by constructing a
unified latent space, where a variational autoencoder constrained by reverse KL
divergence embeds adaptation actions into modes of the pre-training action
latent distribution. Subsequently, it steers the diffusion- or flow-based VLA's
generation process during fine-tuning via a guidance mechanism that pushes the
model's output distribution towards the target domain. We conduct extensive
experiments on cross-embodiment and cross-task manipulation in both simulation
and real world. Compared to direct fine-tuning of representative VLAs, our
method improves the average multi-task success rate by up to \textbf{9.8\%} in
simulation and achieves a striking \textbf{32\% success rate gain} in a
real-world cross-embodiment setting. Our work presents a general and
lightweight solution that greatly enhances the practicality of deploying VLA
models to new robotic platforms and tasks.

Motivation: To provide an analytical and computationally efficient method for identifying base inertial parameters in robotic systems using geometric formulations.

Method: Proposed a new TP (tetrahedral-point) model and three principles for parameter analysis. Developed algorithms like DRNG with theoretical $O(1)$ complexity and validated them on various robots.

Result: Algorithms identified the complete set of base parameters for different robot examples with high robustness and efficiency, particularly for PKMs.

Conclusion: The proposed geometric method is general, robust, and efficient for analyzing robotic base inertial parameters, verified through demonstrations.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel geometric method for analytically determining the
base inertial parameters of robotic systems. The rigid body dynamics is
reformulated using projective geometric algebra, leading to a new
identification model named ``tetrahedral-point (TP)" model. Based on the rigid
body TP model, coefficients in the regresoor matrix of the identification model
are derived in closed-form, exhibiting clear geometric interpretations.
Building directly from the dynamic model, three foundational principles for
base parameter analysis are proposed: the shared points principle, fixed points
principle, and planar rotations principle. With these principles, algorithms
are developed to automatically determine all the base parameters. The core
algorithm, referred to as Dynamics Regressor Nullspace Generator (DRNG),
achieves $O(1)$-complexity theoretically following an $O(N)$-complexity
preprocessing stage, where $N$ is the number of rigid bodies. The proposed
method and algorithms are validated across four robots: Puma560, Unitree Go2, a
2RRU-1RRS parallel kinematics mechanism (PKM), and a 2PRS-1PSR PKM. In all
cases, the algorithms successfully identify the complete set of base
parameters. Notably, the approach demonstrates high robustness and
computational efficiency, particularly in the cases of PKMs. Through the
comprehensive demonstrations, the method is shown to be general, robust, and
efficient.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method, HPLSV, that integrates learned social navigation values into robotic path planning to manage social scenarios like joining queues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address gaps in robotic navigation where traditional methods fail to account for adherence to social norms needed for robots to be socially accepted.

Method: The research involves developing Heuristic Planning with Learned Social Value (HPLSV), which incorporates a learned social value function as an additional heuristic in robotic path planning.

Result: The proposed method is implemented for the specific social scenario of a robot joining a queue, showcasing its feasibility and potential to handle complex human activities.

Conclusion: The study concludes that HPLSV contributes to socially-aware robotic behavior and has the potential for broader application in aligning robots with human social norms.

Abstract: Social robotic navigation has been at the center of numerous studies in
recent years. Most of the research has focused on driving the robotic agent
along obstacle-free trajectories, respecting social distances from humans, and
predicting their movements to optimize navigation. However, in order to really
be socially accepted, the robots must be able to attain certain social norms
that cannot arise from conventional navigation, but require a dedicated
learning process. We propose Heuristic Planning with Learned Social Value
(HPLSV), a method to learn a value function encapsulating the cost of social
navigation, and use it as an additional heuristic in heuristic-search path
planning. In this preliminary work, we apply the methodology to the common
social scenario of joining a queue of people, with the intention of
generalizing to further human activities.

Motivation: To address challenges in optimizing industrial robot work cells, particularly considering the computational difficulties of motion-level optimization and its effects on high-level outcomes.

Method: Developed metrics assessing optimality, time gain, robustness, and consistency of motion-planning trade-offs. Conducted simulations to analyze trade-offs and applied algorithms for kinematic design optimization in robotic palletization scenarios.

Result: The analysis provided insights into the impacts of motion-level trade-offs on high-level bilevel optimization. The applied algorithms successfully optimized the modular robot’s kinematic design for two specific scenarios.

Conclusion: Carefully balanced trade-offs in motion planning can improve the computational feasibility and high-level solution quality, providing a method to optimize work cell layouts effectively.

Abstract: The performance of industrial robotic work cells depends on optimizing
various hyperparameters referring to the cell layout, such as robot base
placement, tool placement, and kinematic design. Achieving this requires a
bilevel optimization approach, where the high-level optimization adjusts these
hyperparameters, and the low-level optimization computes robot motions.
However, computing the optimal robot motion is computationally infeasible,
introducing trade-offs in motion planning to make the problem tractable. These
trade-offs significantly impact the overall performance of the bilevel
optimization, but their effects still need to be systematically evaluated. In
this paper, we introduce metrics to assess these trade-offs regarding
optimality, time gain, robustness, and consistency. Through extensive
simulation studies, we investigate how simplifications in motion-level
optimization affect the high-level optimization outcomes, balancing
computational complexity with solution quality. The proposed algorithms are
applied to find the time-optimal kinematic design for a modular robot in two
palletization scenarios.

Method: The method introduces a radar-based framework with three modules: parallel frame accumulation to enhance noisy radar data, a diffusion model to refine semantic point clouds, and a sparse 3D network optimized for large-scale radar processing.

Result: Experiments on a self-built agricultural dataset showed superior prediction performance with reduced computational (by 51.3%) and memory costs (by 27.5%). The framework successfully reconstructs challenging thin structures like poles and wires.

Conclusion: The framework provides a robust and efficient alternative for 3D environmental perception, demonstrating its potential in agricultural robotic navigation scenarios with sensor contamination risks.

Abstract: Accurate and robust environmental perception is crucial for robot autonomous

hierarchical learning framework that first filters radar sidelobe artifacts
then generates fine-grained 3D semantic point clouds. 3) A specifically
designed sparse 3D network optimized for processing large-scale radar raw data.
We conducted extensive benchmark comparisons and experimental evaluations on a
self-built dataset collected in real-world agricultural field scenes. Results
demonstrate that our method achieves superior structural and semantic
prediction performance compared to existing methods, while simultaneously
reducing computational and memory costs by 51.3% and 27.5%, respectively.

Method: The proposed framework integrates a Large Language Model (LLM) for planning action primitives and a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for fine-grained visual grounding, leveraging SigLIP2 and DoRA-enhanced tuning techniques.

Result: Experiments show superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in simulation for seen/unseen instructions and tasks, and robust execution in real-world scenarios with diverse cloth materials.

Conclusion: The integration of LLM and VLM enables effective multi-step manipulation of deformable objects, demonstrating high performance, generalization, and practical applicability in robotic cloth folding.

Abstract: Language-guided long-horizon manipulation of deformable objects presents
significant challenges due to high degrees of freedom, complex dynamics, and
the need for accurate vision-language grounding. In this work, we focus on
multi-step cloth folding, a representative deformable-object manipulation task
that requires both structured long-horizon planning and fine-grained visual
perception. To this end, we propose a unified framework that integrates a Large
Language Model (LLM)-based planner, a Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based
perception system, and a task execution module. Specifically, the LLM-based
planner decomposes high-level language instructions into low-level action
primitives, bridging the semantic-execution gap, aligning perception with
action, and enhancing generalization. The VLM-based perception module employs a
SigLIP2-driven architecture with a bidirectional cross-attention fusion
mechanism and weight-decomposed low-rank adaptation (DoRA) fine-tuning to
achieve language-conditioned fine-grained visual grounding. Experiments in both
simulation and real-world settings demonstrate the method's effectiveness. In
simulation, it outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 2.23, 1.87, and 33.3
on seen instructions, unseen instructions, and unseen tasks, respectively. On a
real robot, it robustly executes multi-step folding sequences from language
instructions across diverse cloth materials and configurations, demonstrating
strong generalization in practical scenarios. Project page:

### [759] [Physics-Informed Machine Learning with Adaptive Grids for Optical Microrobot Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02343)
*Lan Wei,Lou Genoud,Dandan Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a physics-informed framework for 3D depth estimation of optical microrobots, outperforming deep learning models with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional deep learning methods struggle with optical microrobots due to their transparent nature, low-contrast imaging, and data annotation limitations.

Method: A novel depth estimation framework combining convolutional feature extraction with physics-based focus metrics, using an adaptive grid strategy to reduce computational complexity.

Result: The proposed model showed more than 60% reduction in MSE and better R² values compared to baselines, even with 80% less training data.

Conclusion: The framework is effective, data-efficient, and robust, offering significant advances for 3D perception in biomedical microrobot applications.

Abstract: Optical microrobots actuated by optical tweezers (OT) offer great potential
for biomedical applications such as cell manipulation and microscale assembly.
These tasks demand accurate three-dimensional perception to ensure precise
control in complex and dynamic biological environments. However, the
transparent nature of microrobots and low-contrast microscopic imaging
challenge conventional deep learning methods, which also require large
annotated datasets that are costly to obtain. To address these challenges, we
propose a physics-informed, data-efficient framework for depth estimation of
optical microrobots. Our method augments convolutional feature extraction with
physics-based focus metrics, such as entropy, Laplacian of Gaussian, and
gradient sharpness, calculated using an adaptive grid strategy. This approach
allocates finer grids over microrobot regions and coarser grids over background
areas, enhancing depth sensitivity while reducing computational complexity. We
evaluate our framework on multiple microrobot types and demonstrate significant
improvements over baseline models. Specifically, our approach reduces mean
squared error (MSE) by over 60% and improves the coefficient of determination
(R^2) across all test cases. Notably, even when trained on only 20% of the
available data, our model outperforms ResNet50 trained on the full dataset,
highlighting its robustness under limited data conditions. Our code is

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces OpenGuide, a robotic system designed to assist blind or visually impaired individuals in locating multiple objects in complex environments, leveraging vision-language models, exploration algorithms, and decision processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges faced by visually impaired individuals in locating multiple objects within cluttered indoor environments, where existing technologies fail to offer efficient multi-object search capabilities.

Method: OpenGuide integrates vision-language models, natural language understanding, frontier-based exploration, and a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) planner to adaptively navigate and locate objects based on open-vocabulary requests and scene reasoning.

Result: Experiments in simulated and real-world environments demonstrated significant improvements in task success rates and search efficiency compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: OpenGuide provides a scalable foundation for robotic assistance in assisted living environments, improving multi-object search capabilities for visually impaired users.

Abstract: Indoor built environments like homes and offices often present complex and
cluttered layouts that pose significant challenges for individuals who are
blind or visually impaired, especially when performing tasks that involve
locating and gathering multiple objects. While many existing assistive
technologies focus on basic navigation or obstacle avoidance, few systems
provide scalable and efficient multi-object search capabilities in real-world,
partially observable settings. To address this gap, we introduce OpenGuide, an
assistive mobile robot system that combines natural language understanding with
vision-language foundation models (VLM), frontier-based exploration, and a
Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) planner. OpenGuide
interprets open-vocabulary requests, reasons about object-scene relationships,
and adaptively navigates and localizes multiple target items in novel
environments. Our approach enables robust recovery from missed detections
through value decay and belief-space reasoning, resulting in more effective
exploration and object localization. We validate OpenGuide in simulated and
real-world experiments, demonstrating substantial improvements in task success
rate and search efficiency over prior methods. This work establishes a
foundation for scalable, human-centered robotic assistance in assisted living
environments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces U-Arm, a low-cost, adaptable teleoperation framework for robotic arms, with enhanced control, mechanical designs, and open-source resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current open-source leader-follower interfaces for robotic arms are either expensive or lack compatibility and usability with various commercial robotic arm configurations.

Method: U-Arm consists of 3D-printed leader arms (6-DoF and 7-DoF versions) with consistent control logic and optimized mechanical designs, alongside open-sourced CAD models, simulation support, and real-world data collected using the framework.

Result: U-Arm achieved 39% higher data collection efficiency and comparable task success rates compared to Joycon across multiple manipulation scenarios, at a significantly lower cost of $50.5–$56.8.

Conclusion: U-Arm effectively addresses cost, adaptability, and usability challenges in robotic teleoperation, making it accessible and effective for diverse applications while promoting further development through open-source contributions.

Abstract: We propose U-Arm, a low-cost and rapidly adaptable leader-follower
teleoperation framework designed to interface with most of commercially
available robotic arms. Our system supports teleoperation through three
structurally distinct 3D-printed leader arms that share consistent control
logic, enabling seamless compatibility with diverse commercial robot
configurations. Compared with previous open-source leader-follower interfaces,
we further optimized both the mechanical design and servo selection, achieving
a bill of materials (BOM) cost of only \$50.5 for the 6-DoF leader arm and
\$56.8 for the 7-DoF version. To enhance usability, we mitigate the common
challenge in controlling redundant degrees of freedom by %engineering methods
mechanical and control optimizations. Experimental results demonstrate that
U-Arm achieves 39\% higher data collection efficiency and comparable task
success rates across multiple manipulation scenarios compared with Joycon,
another low-cost teleoperation interface. We have open-sourced all CAD models
of three configs and also provided simulation support for validating
teleoperation workflows. We also open-sourced real-world manipulation data
collected with U-Arm. The project website is

### [762] [Coral: A Unifying Abstraction Layer for Composable Robotics Software](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02453)
*Steven Swanbeck,Mitch Pryor*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Coral, an abstraction layer for robotics software integration, aiming to simplify system integration while maximizing adaptability and composability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotics software often requires significant engineering effort for even small modifications due to tightly coupled systems, creating challenges in adaptability and reusability.

Method: The authors developed Coral as a higher-level abstraction layer to complement existing tools, streamlining integration with semantically meaningful choices and improving composability.

Result: Coral demonstrated effective system integration in case studies such as LiDAR-based SLAM and multi-robot tasks, showcasing adaptability across complex scenarios.

Conclusion: Coral improves reusability, reconfigurability, and accessibility of robotics systems for users of varying expertise, addressing scalable integration challenges. It is released as open-source software.

Abstract: Despite the multitude of excellent software components and tools available in
the robotics and broader software engineering communities, successful
integration of software for robotic systems remains a time-consuming and
challenging task for users of all knowledge and skill levels. And with robotics
software often being built into tightly coupled, monolithic systems, even minor
alterations to improve performance, adjust to changing task requirements, or
deploy to new hardware can require significant engineering investment. To help
solve this problem, this paper presents Coral, an abstraction layer for
building, deploying, and coordinating independent software components that
maximizes composability to allow for rapid system integration without modifying
low-level code. Rather than replacing existing tools, Coral complements them by
introducing a higher-level abstraction that constrains the integration process
to semantically meaningful choices, reducing the configuration burden without
limiting adaptability to diverse domains, systems, and tasks. We describe Coral
in detail and demonstrate its utility in integrating software for scenarios of
increasing complexity, including LiDAR-based SLAM and multi-robot corrosion
mitigation tasks. By enabling practical composability in robotics software,
Coral offers a scalable solution to a broad range of robotics system
integration challenges, improving component reusability, system
reconfigurability, and accessibility to both expert and non-expert users. We
release Coral open source.

*Haoran Li,Yijiong Lin,Chenghua Lu,Max Yang,Efi Psomopoulou,Nathan F Lepora*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper classifies vision-based tactile sensors (VBTS) into two principles—Marker-Based and Intensity-Based—while exploring their subtypes, hardware characteristics, interpretation methods, and challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide clarity amidst the diversity in design, sensing principles, and interpretation methods of vision-based tactile sensors for their widespread application in robotics.

Method: The authors propose a novel classification of VBTS into two sensing principles, further subdivided into four mechanisms, and conduct a comparative analysis of their hardware and data interpretation methods.

Result: The study categorizes VBTS into Marker-Based (Simple and Morphological) and Intensity-Based (Reflective Layer-based and Transparent Layer-Based) mechanisms, highlighting their distinct characteristics, capabilities, and challenges.

Conclusion: The classification and comparison illuminate current challenges in VBTS technology, suggesting pathways for advancing the field in aspects such as design optimization and data interpretation.

Abstract: Vision-based tactile sensors (VBTS) have gained widespread application in
robotic hands, grippers and prosthetics due to their high spatial resolution,
low manufacturing costs, and ease of customization. While VBTSs have common
design features, such as a camera module, they can differ in a rich diversity
of sensing principles, material compositions, multimodal approaches, and data
interpretation methods. Here, we propose a novel classification of VBTS that
categorizes the technology into two primary sensing principles based on the
underlying transduction of contact into a tactile image: the Marker-Based
Transduction Principle and the Intensity-Based Transduction Principle.
Marker-Based Transduction interprets tactile information by detecting marker
displacement and changes in marker density. In contrast, Intensity-Based
Transduction maps external disturbances with variations in pixel values.
Depending on the design of the contact module, Marker-Based Transduction can be
further divided into two subtypes: Simple Marker-Based (SMB) and Morphological
Marker-Based (MMB) mechanisms. Similarly, the Intensity-Based Transduction
Principle encompasses the Reflective Layer-based (RLB) and Transparent
Layer-Based (TLB) mechanisms. This paper provides a comparative study of the
hardware characteristics of these four types of sensors including various
combination types, and discusses the commonly used methods for interpreting
tactile information. This~comparison reveals some current challenges faced by
VBTS technology and directions for future research.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure satellite mission longevity and mitigate risks associated with faulty spacecraft operations, reducing collisions and enabling sustainable space practices.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Camera Depth Models (CDMs), which use RGB and depth camera data to improve depth prediction for robotic manipulation tasks, achieving high accuracy and better generalization to real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robotic manipulation relying on 2D visual observations struggles to generalize well, and leveraging 3D geometric information like humans do appears promising but challenging due to noisy depth camera data.

Method: The authors developed CDMs, a depth-denoising approach using RGB and raw depth signals, trained with paired simulation data generated by modeling depth noise patterns via a neural data engine.

Result: CDMs achieved near-simulation accuracy in depth prediction and enabled manipulation policies trained only on simulated data to transfer effectively to real robots, handling challenging long-horizon tasks.

Conclusion: This research illustrates the potential of using depth cameras and simulation data to improve robotic manipulation tasks and encourages further exploration of 3D information in robot policy design.

Abstract: Modern robotic manipulation primarily relies on visual observations in a 2D
color space for skill learning but suffers from poor generalization. In
contrast, humans, living in a 3D world, depend more on physical properties-such
as distance, size, and shape-than on texture when interacting with objects.
Since such 3D geometric information can be acquired from widely available depth
cameras, it appears feasible to endow robots with similar perceptual
capabilities. Our pilot study found that using depth cameras for manipulation
is challenging, primarily due to their limited accuracy and susceptibility to
various types of noise. In this work, we propose Camera Depth Models (CDMs) as
a simple plugin on daily-use depth cameras, which take RGB images and raw depth
signals as input and output denoised, accurate metric depth. To achieve this,
we develop a neural data engine that generates high-quality paired data from
simulation by modeling a depth camera's noise pattern. Our results show that
CDMs achieve nearly simulation-level accuracy in depth prediction, effectively
bridging the sim-to-real gap for manipulation tasks. Notably, our experiments
demonstrate, for the first time, that a policy trained on raw simulated depth,
without the need for adding noise or real-world fine-tuning, generalizes
seamlessly to real-world robots on two challenging long-horizon tasks involving
articulated, reflective, and slender objects, with little to no performance
degradation. We hope our findings will inspire future research in utilizing
simulation data and 3D information in general robot policies.

### [766] [LLM-based Triplet Extraction for Automated Ontology Generation in Software Engineering Standards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00140)
*Songhui Yue*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper suggests a method for ontology generation using large language models (LLMs) to process unstructured software engineering standards, achieving promising results in relation extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ontology generation is essential for knowledge representation, especially in processing complex, unstructured texts like software engineering standards.

Method: The study uses an LLM-based workflow including document segmentation, candidate term mining, relation inference, term normalization, and cross-section alignment for ontology generation.

Result: The proposed approach performs comparably or better than the OpenIE method for relation triple extraction, as evaluated on golden-standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: The results indicate that LLMs can effectively aid in ontology generation, presenting a scalable and reliable alternative to traditional methods.

Abstract: Ontologies have supported knowledge representation and whitebox reasoning for
decades; thus, the automated ontology generation (AOG) plays a crucial role in
scaling their use. Software engineering standards (SES) consist of long,
unstructured text (with high noise) and paragraphs with domain-specific terms.
In this setting, relation triple extraction (RTE), together with term
extraction, constitutes the first stage toward AOG. This work proposes an
open-source large language model (LLM)-assisted approach to RTE for SES.
Instead of solely relying on prompt-engineering-based methods, this study
promotes the use of LLMs as an aid in constructing ontologies and explores an
effective AOG workflow that includes document segmentation, candidate term
mining, LLM-based relation inference, term normalization, and cross-section
alignment. Golden-standard benchmarks at three granularities are constructed
and used to evaluate the ontology generated from the study. The results show
that it is comparable and potentially superior to the OpenIE method of triple
extraction.

TL;DR: LLM4FP is a new framework using Large Language Models for generating floating-point programs to identify numerical inconsistencies across compilers. It outperforms existing tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address floating-point inconsistencies in numerical software caused by compilers, which can undermine software reliability.

Method: LLM4FP combines Grammar-Based Generation and Feedback-Based Mutation techniques to generate diverse and valid floating-point programs for testing compiler inconsistencies.

Result: LLM4FP detects more than twice the inconsistencies than the state-of-the-art tool, Varity, across multiple compilers and optimization levels with diverse program inputs.

Conclusion: LLM4FP demonstrates that using Large Language Models enhances the detection of floating-point numerical inconsistencies across compilers and optimization levels.

Abstract: Floating-point inconsistencies across compilers can undermine the reliability
of numerical software. We present LLM4FP, the first framework that uses Large
Language Models (LLMs) to generate floating-point programs specifically
designed to trigger such inconsistencies. LLM4FP combines Grammar-Based
Generation and Feedback-Based Mutation to produce diverse and valid programs.
We evaluate LLM4FP across multiple compilers and optimization levels, measuring
inconsistency rate, time cost, and program diversity. LLM4FP detects over twice
as many inconsistencies compared to the state-of-the-art tool, Varity. Notably,
most of the inconsistencies involve real-valued differences, rather than
extreme values like NaN or infinities. LLM4FP also uncovers inconsistencies
across a wider range of optimization levels, and finds the most mismatches
between host and device compilers. These results show that LLM-guided program
generation improves the detection of numerical inconsistencies.

TL;DR: JS-TOD is a tool that identifies order-dependent test flakiness in JavaScript Jest tests through random reordering and rerunning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identify and address test flakiness caused by execution order dependencies in JavaScript testing environments.

Method: JS-TOD systematically randomizes test orders, suites, and describe blocks, allowing customizable reruns to detect flakiness.

Result: Evaluation shows test order dependency flakiness arises from shared files and shared mocking states.

Conclusion: JS-TOD enables detection of test order flaws, promoting isolation and consistency in testing outcomes.

Abstract: We present JS-TOD (JavaScript Test Order-dependency Detector), a tool that
can extract, reorder, and rerun Jest tests to reveal possible order-dependent
test flakiness. Test order dependency is one of the leading causes of test
flakiness. Ideally, each test should operate in isolation and yield consistent
results no matter the sequence in which tests are run. However, in practice,
test outcomes can vary depending on their execution order. JS-TOD employed a
systematic approach to randomising tests, test suites, and describe blocks. The
tool is highly customisable, as one can set the number of orders and reruns
required (the default setting is 10 reorder and 10 reruns for each test and
test suite). Our evaluation using JS-TOD reveals two main causes of test order
dependency flakiness: shared files and shared mocking state between tests.

TL;DR: The paper explores using audio messages for user bug reporting and highlights unique challenges in analyzing such reports.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore simple and efficient methods for mobile app users to report bugs and enable quicker fault identification and resolution.

Method: Conducted a preliminary experiment to assess the potential of audio messages for bug reporting and the challenges involved.

Result: Audio bug reports were analyzed to identify unique challenges in reproducing and addressing bugs reported this way.

Conclusion: Audio recording has potential as a bug reporting tool, but further research is required to address its specific challenges for effective utilization.

Abstract: Bug reporting is a key feature of mobile applications, as it enables
developers to collect information about faults that escaped testing and thus
affected end-users. This paper explores the idea of allowing end-users to
immediately report the problems that they experience by recording and
submitting audio messages. Audio recording is simple to implement and has the
potential to increase the number of bug reports that development teams can
gather, thus potentially improving the rate at which bugs are identified and
fixed. However, audio bug reports exhibit specific characteristics that
challenge existing techniques for reproducing bugs. This paper discusses these
challenges based on a preliminary experiment, and motivates further research on
the collection and analysis of audio-based bug reports

### [770] [REConnect: Participatory RE that Matters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01006)
*Daniela Damian,Bachan Ghimire,Ze Shi Li*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces REConnect, a human-centered, participatory approach to requirements engineering (RE), focused on human connection and lived experiences, supported by three case studies and actionable practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current practices in requirements engineering, such as CrowdRE and AI-assisted elicitation, often fail to address the cultural, social, and political contexts of human values and lived experiences.

Method: The paper introduces REConnect, which emphasizes principles of trust building, stakeholder co-design, and empowering users. It also details actionable practices ('REActions') for embedding human-centric engagement throughout the RE process.

Result: Through three societal-impact case studies (BloodSync in Nepal, Herluma in Canada, BridgingRoots in the Canadian Arctic), the study demonstrates that REConnect yields culturally grounded, socially legitimate, and sustainable requirements.

Conclusion: REConnect offers a framework that aligns requirements engineering with human values, emphasizes participatory processes, and provides guidance for integrating generative AI responsibly into RE while preserving human agency and ethics.

Abstract: Software increasingly shapes the infrastructures of daily life, making
requirements engineering (RE) central to ensuring that systems align with human
values and lived experiences. Yet, current popular practices such as CrowdRE
and AI-assisted elicitation strategies risk detaching requirements work from
the cultural, social, and political contexts that shape lived experiences,
human values, and real user needs. In this paper, we introduce REConnect that
re-centers RE on the human connection as central to the understanding of lived
experiences where impact is sought. REConnect advocates for a human-centered
participatory approach "that matters" to the communities and beneficiaries
involved, ensuring alignment with their values and aspirations. Drawing on
three case studies of societal impact: BloodSync in rural Nepal, Herluma
supporting women at risk of homelessness in Canada, and BridgingRoots to
revitalize Indigenous languages in the Canadian Arctic. REConnect argues that
three key principles and enablers: building trusting relationships,
co-designing with and alongside stakeholders, and empowering users as agents of
change, can yield requirements that are culturally grounded, socially
legitimate, and sustainable beyond system delivery. REConnect also proposes a
set of actionable practices (REActions) that embed relationality and ongoing
stakeholder engagement throughout requirements elicitation, analysis, and
validation of solution development. Finally, we situate REConnect in the era of
Generative AI. While AI can accelerate and scale certain RE tasks, its
integration must be guided by participatory practices that not only preserve
human agency but also empower humans' roles to become guardians of values and
ethics, inclusion amplifiers, curators of AI outputs, and co-reflectors in
iterative review cycles.

*Ateeq Sharfuddin,Travis Breaux*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper explores using GPT-4o and textual entailment to extract stakeholder goals from interview transcripts, achieving promising results in extraction accuracy and goal model generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency and reliability of identifying and documenting stakeholder requirements during goal modeling in software engineering, especially from interview transcripts.

Method: The approach utilized textual entailment with GPT-4o to extract goals directly from interview transcripts. Performance was evaluated on 15 transcripts covering 29 domains, assessing goal extraction and tracing accuracy.

Result: The method achieved 62.0% goal extraction match with humans, 98.7% tracing accuracy, and 72.2% for generating goal model relationships as rated by human annotators.

Conclusion: GPT-4o shows promise in assisting business analysts by automating goal extraction, with strong accuracy metrics, though refinement is needed for higher precision in goal modeling.

Abstract: In software engineering, requirements may be acquired from stakeholders
through elicitation methods, such as interviews, observational studies, and
focus groups. When supporting acquisition from interviews, business analysts
must review transcripts to identify and document requirements. Goal modeling is
a popular technique for representing early stakeholder requirements as it lends
itself to various analyses, including refinement to map high-level goals into
software operations, and conflict and obstacle analysis. In this paper, we
describe an approach to use textual entailment to reliably extract goals from
interview transcripts and to construct goal models. The approach has been
evaluated on 15 interview transcripts across 29 application domains. The
findings show that GPT-4o can reliably extract goals from interview
transcripts, matching 62.0% of goals acquired by humans from the same
transcripts, and that GPT-4o can trace goals to originating text in the
transcript with 98.7% accuracy. In addition, when evaluated by human
annotators, GPT-4o generates goal model refinement relationships among
extracted goals with 72.2% accuracy.

TL;DR: Lin-Hunter is a novel testing framework for FPGA logic synthesis tools that enhances test-case diversity and bug discovery using metamorphic transformations and adaptive strategy selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FPGA tools are critical for EDA, but existing testing methods fail to adequately explore structural diversity in test cases, limiting their ability to uncover bugs.

Method: Lin-Hunter uses metamorphic transformation rules to generate structurally diverse test cases and employs the LinUCB algorithm to adaptively prioritize more effective transformation strategies.

Result: Lin-Hunter discovered 18 unique bugs, including 10 new ones, and demonstrated superior performance in test-case diversity and bug discovery compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Lin-Hunter provides an efficient and systematic approach to validating FPGA synthesis tools, outperforming existing methods in its ability to identify bugs and increase test-case diversity.

Abstract: Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) play an indispensable role in
Electronic Design Automation (EDA), translating Register-Transfer Level (RTL)
designs into gate-level netlists. The correctness and reliability of FPGA logic
synthesis tools are critically important, as unnoticed bugs in these tools may
infect the final hardware implementations. However, recent approaches often
rely heavily on random selection strategies, limiting the structural diversity
of the generated HDL test cases and resulting in inadequate exploration of the
tool's feature space. To address this limitation, we propose Lin-Hunter, a
novel testing framework designed to systematically enhance the diversity of HDL
test cases and the efficiency of FPGA logic synthesis tool validation.
Specifically, Lin-Hunter introduces a principled set of metamorphic
transformation rules to generate functionally equivalent yet structurally
diverse HDL test case variants, effectively addressing the limited diversity of
existing test inputs. To further enhance bug discovery efficiency, Lin-Hunter
integrates an adaptive strategy selection mechanism based on the Linear Upper
Confidence Bound (LinUCB) method. This method leverages feedback from synthesis
logs of previously executed test cases to dynamically prioritize transformation
strategies that have empirically demonstrated a higher likelihood of triggering
synthesis bugs. Comprehensive experiments conducted over a three-month period
demonstrate the practical effectiveness of Lin-Hunter. Our method has
discovered 18 unique bugs, including 10 previously unreported defects, which
have been confirmed by official developers. Moreover, our method outperforms
state-of-the-art testing methods in both test-case diversity and bug-discovery
efficiency.

### [774] [Policy-driven Software Bill of Materials on GitHub: An Empirical Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01255)
*Oleksii Novikov,Davide Fucci,Oleksandr Adamov,Daniel Mendez*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper examines the adoption of policy-driven Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) in open-source projects, revealing limited usage, significant vulnerabilities, and gaps in licensing reporting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the current state of policy-driven SBOMs in open-source projects, aiming to enhance software security and project transparency while addressing compliance needs.

Method: The study involves mining GitHub repositories to identify policy-driven SBOMs and analyzing their contents (security vulnerabilities and licensing information) using descriptive statistics.

Result: The analysis found that only 0.56% of popular GitHub projects use policy-driven SBOMs. These dependencies reveal 2,202 unique vulnerabilities, with 22% lacking licensing information.

Conclusion: The work highlights the limited adoption of SBOMs in open-source projects and underscores their potential in supporting security assessment and licensing management.

Abstract: Background. The Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a machine-readable list
of all the software dependencies included in a software. SBOM emerged as way to
assist securing the software supply chain. However, despite mandates from
governments to use SBOM, research on this artifact is still in its early
stages. Aims. We want to understand the current state of SBOM in open-source
projects, focusing specifically on policy-driven SBOMs, i.e., SBOM created to
achieve security goals, such as enhancing project transparency and ensuring
compliance, rather than being used as fixtures for tools or artificially
generated for benchmarking or academic research purposes. Method. We performed
a mining software repository study to collect and carefully select SBOM files
hosted on GitHub. We analyzed the information reported in policy-driven SBOMs
and the vulnerabilities associated with the declared dependencies by means of
descriptive statistics. Results. We show that only 0.56% of popular GitHub
repositories contain policy-driven SBOM. The declared dependencies contain
2,202 unique vulnerabilities, while 22% of them do not report licensing
information. Conclusion. Our findings provide insights for SBOM usage to
support security assessment and licensing.

### [775] [Metamorphic Testing of Multimodal Human Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01294)
*Helge Spieker,Nadjib Lazaar,Arnaud Gotlieb,Nassim Belmecheri*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Metamorphic Testing (MT) framework to test multimodal human trajectory prediction systems, overcoming oracle challenges by leveraging metamorphic relations and probability-based metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Testing multimodal Human Trajectory Prediction (HTP) models is difficult due to the stochastic outputs and the lack of a definitive correctness criterion for trajectories in a given scenario. Ensuring the reliability of autonomous systems necessitates robust testing methodologies.

Method: The paper outlines five metamorphic relations, including label-preserving geometric transformations and map-altering transformations, to adjust inputs and evaluate corresponding output changes. It employs probabilistic violation criteria, using metrics like Wasserstein and Hellinger distances, to assess trajectory distribution deviations.

Result: The study offers a systematic methodology for testing HTP systems, introducing a MT framework incorporating input transformations and probabilistic evaluation criteria that enable robustness assessment without relying on ground-truth data.

Conclusion: The proposed MT framework effectively addresses the testing challenges of multimodal and stochastic HTP systems by enabling reliability evaluation through input transformation and contextual changes, advancing the robustness of autonomous systems.

Abstract: Context: Predicting human trajectories is crucial for the safety and
reliability of autonomous systems, such as automated vehicles and mobile
robots. However, rigorously testing the underlying multimodal Human Trajectory
Prediction (HTP) models, which typically use multiple input sources (e.g.,
trajectory history and environment maps) and produce stochastic outputs
(multiple possible future paths), presents significant challenges. The primary
difficulty lies in the absence of a definitive test oracle, as numerous future
trajectories might be plausible for any given scenario. Objectives: This
research presents the application of Metamorphic Testing (MT) as a systematic
methodology for testing multimodal HTP systems. We address the oracle problem
through metamorphic relations (MRs) adapted for the complexities and stochastic
nature of HTP. Methods: We present five MRs, targeting transformations of both
historical trajectory data and semantic segmentation maps used as an
environmental context. These MRs encompass: 1) label-preserving geometric
transformations (mirroring, rotation, rescaling) applied to both trajectory and
map inputs, where outputs are expected to transform correspondingly. 2)
Map-altering transformations (changing semantic class labels, introducing
obstacles) with predictable changes in trajectory distributions. We propose
probabilistic violation criteria based on distance metrics between probability
distributions, such as the Wasserstein or Hellinger distance. Conclusion: This
study introduces tool, a MT framework for the oracle-less testing of
multimodal, stochastic HTP systems. It allows for assessment of model
robustness against input transformations and contextual changes without
reliance on ground-truth trajectories.

### [776] [Aligning Requirement for Large Language Model's Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01313)
*Zhao Tian,Junjie Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The proposed paper introduces Specine, a technique to improve the specification alignment in code generation tasks using large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Misalignment between programming specifications and the code generated by LLMs hinders the efficiency and usability of these models in solving complex real-world problems. Current agent-based techniques fail to address this critical issue.

Method: The authors propose Specine, which identifies specification misalignments, refines LLM-perceived specifications, and aligns them to enhance code generation performance. Experiments involving competitive benchmarks and comparisons with existing baselines were conducted.

Result: The experiments demonstrate that Specine yields significant performance improvements, outperforming the most effective baseline by an average of 29.60% across all subjects in Pass@1 evaluations.

Conclusion: Specine proves to be an effective technique that addresses specification misalignment in LLM-based code generation, providing a substantial enhancement over the state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Code generation refers to the automatic generation of source code based on a
given programming specification, which has garnered significant attention
particularly with the advancement of large language models (LLMs). However, due
to the inherent complexity of real-world problems, the LLM-generated code often
fails to fully align with the provided specification. While state-of-the-art
agent-based techniques have been proposed to enhance LLM code generation, they
overlook the critical issue of specification perception, resulting in
persistent misalignment issues. Given that accurate perception of programming
specifications serves as the foundation of the LLM-based code generation
paradigm, ensuring specification alignment is particularly crucial. In this
work, we draw on software requirements engineering to propose Specine, a novel
specification alignment technique for LLM code generation. Its key idea is to
identify misaligned input specifications, lift LLM-perceived specifications,
and align them to enhance the code generation performance of LLMs. Our
comprehensive experiments on four state-of-the-art LLMs across five challenging
competitive benchmarks by comparing with ten state-of-the-art baselines,
demonstrate the effectiveness of Specine. For example, Specine outperforms the
most effective baseline, achieving an average improvement of 29.60\% across all
subjects in terms of Pass@1.

*Chiara Ghinami,Jonas Winzer,Nils Bosbach,Lennart M. Reimann,Lukas Jünger,Simon Wörner,Rainer Leupers*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework for integrating American-Fuzzy-Lop-based fuzzers with SystemC-based simulators to enhance embedded software testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the limitations of existing embedded software testing frameworks, which often lack support for hardware peripherals, flexibility, and effective corner-case error identification.

Method: The proposed framework decouples fuzzers from simulators, intercepts peripheral accesses, integrates fuzzers for peripheral behavior, and supports flexible interchange of peripherals and virtual prototypes.

Result: The framework successfully integrates the harness with different simulators, demonstrating improved testing capabilities for various embedded software.

Conclusion: This solution broadens the scope of embedding fuzzing into simulation environments, enhancing flexibility, peripheral interfacing, and software reliability in embedded systems.

Abstract: SystemC-based virtual prototypes have emerged as widely adopted tools to test
software ahead of hardware availability, reducing the time-to-market and
improving software reliability. Recently, fuzzing has become a popular method
for automated software testing due to its ability to quickly identify
corner-case errors. However, its application to embedded software is still
limited. Simulator tools can help bridge this gap by providing a more powerful
and controlled execution environment for testing. Existing solutions, however,
often tightly couple fuzzers with built-in simulators that lack support for
hardware peripherals and of- fer limited flexibility, restricting their ability
to test embedded software. To address these limitations, we present a framework
that allows the integration of American-Fuzzy-Lop-based fuzzers and
SystemC-based simulators. The framework provides a harness to decouple the
adopted fuzzer and simulator. In addition, it intercepts peripheral accesses
and queries the fuzzer for values, effectively linking peripheral behavior to
the fuzzer. This solution enables flexible interchangeability of peripher- als
within the simulation environment and supports the interfacing of different
SystemC-based virtual prototypes. The flexibility of the pro- posed solution is
demonstrated by integrating the harness with different simulators and by
testing various softwares.

*Diego Clerissi,Elena Masserini,Daniela Micucci,Leonardo Mariani*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces MUTABOT, a mutation testing tool for identifying defects in task-based chatbot conversations by injecting faults. It also highlights MUTABOT's extension to multiple platforms and evaluates its effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The difficulty of testing all possible conversational scenarios in task-based chatbots, leading to unnoticed defects, motivates the need for an enhanced testing approach.

Method: The authors proposed MUTABOT, a mutation testing approach, extended to multiple platforms (Dialogflow and Rasa), to inject faults in conversations and evaluate the effectiveness of test cases generated by state-of-the-art tools.

Result: Experiments demonstrated how mutation testing with MUTABOT can reveal weaknesses in test suites created by the Botium test generator.

Conclusion: MUTABOT provides a robust way to identify defects in chatbot interactions, and its multi-platform capability enhances testing.

Abstract: Chatbots, also known as conversational agents, have become ubiquitous,
offering services for a multitude of domains. Unlike general-purpose chatbots,
task-based chatbots are software designed to prioritize the completion of tasks
of the domain they handle (e.g., flight booking). Given the growing popularity
of chatbots, testing techniques that can generate full conversations as test
cases have emerged. Still, thoroughly testing all the possible conversational
scenarios implemented by a task-based chatbot is challenging, resulting in
incorrect behaviors that may remain unnoticed. To address this challenge, we
proposed MUTABOT, a mutation testing approach for injecting faults in
conversations and producing faulty chatbots that emulate defects that may
affect the conversational aspects. In this paper, we present our extension of
MUTABOT to multiple platforms (Dialogflow and Rasa), and present experiments
that show how mutation testing can be used to reveal weaknesses in test suites
generated by the Botium state-of-the-art test generator.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: NonTechnical Debt (NTD), including Process, Social, People, and Organizational debts, disrupts large-scale Agile Software Development (ASD).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore how various components of NTD impact ASD environments and identify strategies to mitigate these challenges.

Method: Extensive surveys, in-depth interviews, and statistical analyses with software professionals were conducted.

Result: Key findings include the importance of cohesive teams, psychological safety, efficient processes, and addressing human resource needs to reduce negative impacts on job satisfaction, productivity, and innovation.

Conclusion: Implementing evidence-based strategies, such as refining team composition and fostering psychological safety, can help organizations reduce NTD, improve agility, and unlock team potential.

Abstract: NonTechnical Debt (NTD) is a common challenge in agile software development,
manifesting in four critical forms, Process Debt, Social Debt, People Debt,
Organizational debt. NODLA project is a collaboration between Karlstad
University and four leading Swedish industrial partners, reveals how various
debt types disrupt large scale Agile Software Development (ASD) environments.
Through extensive surveys, indepth interviews, and statistical analyses
involving a diverse group of software professionals, we identified key drivers
of NTD and their impacts. Our findings emphasize (1) Well structured, highly
cohesive teams learn faster, adapt more effectively, and innovate consistently.
(2) Psychological safety, fostered by proactive leadership, is essential for
innovation, experimentation, and keeping employees. (3) Inefficient processes
and unclear roles contribute significantly to drops in job satisfaction,
productivity and team morale. (4) Social fragmentation, particularly in remote
and hybrid settings, breeds rework, delays, and increased costs. (5) Neglected
human resource needs, such as delayed hiring or insufficient training, limit an
organization ability to meet growing demands. This white paper distils these
insights into practical, evidence based strategies, such as refining team
composition, clarifying roles, fostering psychological safety, streamlining
workflows, and embracing failure as a learning tool. By implementing these
strategies, organizations can reduce NTD, reclaim agility, and unlock their
teams full potential.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces SWRBench, a benchmark for Automated Code Review (ACR) tools, featuring 1000 manually verified Pull Requests with project context. It provides an evaluation method aligning strongly with human judgment and demonstrates current ACR's underperformance while proposing an aggregation strategy improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address shortcomings in existing Automated Code Review benchmarks, including lack of real-world project context, insufficient evaluation metrics, and inability to reflect complexities of modern ACR scenarios.

Method: The study introduces SWRBench, a dataset of 1000 manually curated Pull Requests from GitHub, and a structured evaluation method that uses Large Language Models validated against human judgment to assess reviews.

Result: The analysis shows current ACR tools underperform, but also reveals their strength in detecting functional errors. A proposed multi-review aggregation strategy boosts F1 scores substantially, by up to 43.67%.

Conclusion: SWRBench offers a new benchmark that improves assessment of ACR tools and LLMs. The associated methods and findings provide actionable insights to enhance ACR performance and promote further research advancements in the field.

Abstract: Automated Code Review (ACR) is crucial for software quality, yet existing
benchmarks often fail to reflect real-world complexities, hindering the
evaluation of modern Large Language Models (LLMs). Current benchmarks
frequently focus on fine-grained code units, lack complete project context, and
use inadequate evaluation metrics. To address these limitations, we introduce
SWRBench , a new benchmark comprising 1000 manually verified Pull Requests
(PRs) from GitHub, offering PR-centric review with full project context.
SWRBench employs an objective LLM-based evaluation method that aligns strongly
with human judgment (~90 agreement) by verifying if issues from a structured
ground truth are covered in generated reviews. Our systematic evaluation of
mainstream ACR tools and LLMs on SWRBench reveals that current systems
underperform, and ACR tools are more adept at detecting functional errors.
Subsequently, we propose and validate a simple multi-review aggregation
strategy that significantly boosts ACR performance, increasing F1 scores by up
to 43.67%. Our contributions include the SWRBench benchmark, its objective
evaluation method, a comprehensive study of current ACR capabilities, and an
effective enhancement approach, offering valuable insights for advancing ACR
research.

*Amirreza Nayyeri,Abbas Rasoolzadegan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a privacy-preserving tool that uses a local large language model (LLM) to assist in web form testing, suggesting effective field values based on form structure and constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Testing web applications is critical for ensuring their reliability in essential domains like education, finance, and e-commerce. Manual test scenario creation for web forms can be inefficient and error-prone, requiring automated, intelligent solutions without compromising data confidentiality.

Method: The approach involves using a locally-operating large language model to analyze HTML structure, detect input types, extract constraints, and suggest appropriate field values for effective testing of web forms.

Result: The proposed tool generates context-aware field value suggestions while operating without reliance on cloud infrastructure, ensuring data privacy and addressing security concerns.

Conclusion: A privacy-centric, intelligent LLM tool can significantly enhance web form testing efficiency while maintaining data confidentiality, addressing both practical and security challenges in the testing process.

Abstract: Web applications are increasingly used in critical domains such as education,
finance, and e-commerce. This highlights the need to ensure their failure-free
performance. One effective method for evaluating failure-free performance is
web form testing, where defining effective test scenarios is key to a complete
and accurate evaluation. A core aspect of this process involves filling form
fields with suitable values to create effective test cases. However, manually
generating these values is time-consuming and prone to errors. To address this,
various tools have been developed to assist testers. With the appearance of
large language models (LLMs), a new generation of tools seeks to handle this
task more intelligently. Although many LLM-based tools have been introduced, as
these models typically rely on cloud infrastructure, their use in testing
confidential web forms raises concerns about unintended data leakage and
breaches of confidentiality. This paper introduces a privacy-preserving
recommender that operates locally using a large language model. The tool
assists testers in web form testing by suggesting effective field values. This
tool analyzes the HTML structure of forms, detects input types, and extracts
constraints based on each field's type and contextual content, guiding proper
field filling.

*Omur Sahin,Man Zhang,Andrea Arcuri*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces Web Fuzzing Commons (WFC) and Web Fuzzing Dataset (WFD) to tackle key challenges in the fuzzing of REST APIs, such as authentication handling, cataloging fault types, and enabling fair comparisons among fuzzers. Experiments demonstrate its utility with the EvoMaster tool and others.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The main motivation is to address three critical issues in REST API fuzzing: handling API authentication, cataloging diverse fault types discovered by different fuzzers, and facilitating fair fuzzer comparisons with case studies.

Method: The authors propose Web Fuzzing Commons (WFC), a set of open-source libraries, and Web Fuzzing Dataset (WFD), a curated collection of 36 open-source APIs. They conduct experiments using the state-of-the-art EvoMaster and compare it with other leading fuzzers.

Result: The experiments validate the effectiveness of WFC/WFD for supporting fuzzing tasks and enable comparative analysis between EvoMaster and other tools like ARAT-RL, EmRest, LLamaRestTest, RESTler, and Schemathesis.

Conclusion: WFC and WFD provide practical solutions for the challenges in REST API fuzzing, ensuring reproducible evaluations, offering guidelines for tool comparisons, and enhancing the overall quality of fuzzing research.

Abstract: Fuzzing REST APIs is an important research problem, with practical
applications and impact in industry. As such, a lot of research work has been
carried out on this topic in the last few years. However, there are three major
issues that hinder further progress: how to deal with API authentication; how
to catalog and compare different fault types found by different fuzzers; and
what to use as case study to facilitate fair comparisons among fuzzers. To
address these important challenges, we present Web Fuzzing Commons (WFC) and
Web Fuzzing Dataset (WFD). WFC is a set of open-source libraries and schema
definitions to declaratively specify authentication info and catalog different
types of faults that fuzzers can automatically detect. WFD is a collection of
36 open-source APIs with all necessary scaffolding to easily run experiments
with fuzzers, supported by WFC. To show the usefulness of WFC/WFD, a set of
experiments is carried out with EvoMaster, a state-of-the-art fuzzer for Web
APIs. However, any fuzzer can benefit from WFC and WFD. We compare EvoMaster
with other state-of-the-art tools such as ARAT-RL, EmRest, LLamaRestTest,
RESTler, and Schemathesis. We discuss common pitfalls in tool comparisons, as
well as providing guidelines with support of WFC/WFD to avoid them.

### [783] [Automated Generation of Issue-Reproducing Tests by Combining LLMs and Search-Based Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01616)
*Konstantinos Kitsios,Marco Castelluccio,Alberto Bacchelli*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces BLAST, an automated tool for generating issue-reproducing tests by combining LLMs and SBST techniques. BLAST is shown to outperform existing approaches and was successfully deployed in real-world repositories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developers commonly commit patches without verifying them through issue-reproducing tests, which increases the risk of unresolved or recurring issues. Automating the generation of these tests can both enhance developer confidence and streamline quality assurance.

Method: BLAST integrates large language models (LLMs) for extracting context from issue-patch pairs and static analysis, coupled with search-based software testing (SBST) to optimize generation. The process uses intermediate LLM-generated seeds that are adapted into SBST-compatible forms.

Result: BLAST generated issue-reproducing tests for 35.4% of issues in a Python benchmark, surpassing the previous best of 23.5%. When deployed via a GitHub bot, it proposed viable tests for 11 out of 32 pull requests linked to issues, highlighting practical applicability.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that combining LLMs and SBST can significantly improve the automated generation of issue-reproducing tests, though challenges remain. It sets a foundation for future research and tool improvement in real-world software maintenance.

Abstract: Issue-reproducing tests fail on buggy code and pass once a patch is applied,
thus increasing developers' confidence that the issue has been resolved and
will not be re-introduced. However, past research has shown that developers
often commit patches without such tests, making the automated generation of
issue-reproducing tests an area of interest. We propose BLAST, a tool for
automatically generating issue-reproducing tests from issue-patch pairs by
combining LLMs and search-based software testing (SBST). For the LLM part, we
complement the issue description and the patch by extracting relevant context
through git history analysis, static analysis, and SBST-generated tests. For
the SBST part, we adapt SBST for generating issue-reproducing tests; the issue
description and the patch are fed into the SBST optimization through an
intermediate LLM-generated seed, which we deserialize into SBST-compatible
form. BLAST successfully generates issue-reproducing tests for 151/426 (35.4%)
of the issues from a curated Python benchmark, outperforming the
state-of-the-art (23.5%). Additionally, to measure the real-world impact of
BLAST, we built a GitHub bot that runs BLAST whenever a new pull request (PR)
linked to an issue is opened, and if BLAST generates an issue-reproducing test,
the bot proposes it as a comment in the PR. We deployed the bot in three
open-source repositories for three months, gathering data from 32 PRs-issue
pairs. BLAST generated an issue-reproducing test in 11 of these cases, which we
proposed to the developers. By analyzing the developers' feedback, we discuss
challenges and opportunities for researchers and tool builders. Data and

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces Tether, an LLM-powered application supporting software engineers with ADHD through adaptive assistance and context-aware workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of attention and tools for neurodiversity, particularly ADHD, in software engineering workflows.

Method: The researchers designed a desktop application called Tether using local activity monitoring, RAG, and gamification to provide personalized support. Tether integrates OS-level tracking and ADHD-focused chatbot resources.

Result: Preliminary validation through self-use showed improved accuracy and utility following iterative refinements, but target user evaluations are yet to occur.

Conclusion: Tether serves as an initial step toward developing tools tailored to neurodiverse software engineers, illustrating the potential of LLMs for cognitive support in SE workflows.

Abstract: Equity, diversity, and inclusion in software engineering often overlook
neurodiversity, particularly the experiences of developers with Attention
Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Despite the growing awareness about that
population in SE, few tools are designed to support their cognitive challenges
(e.g., sustained attention, task initiation, self-regulation) within
development workflows. We present Tether, an LLM-powered desktop application
designed to support software engineers with ADHD by delivering adaptive,
context-aware assistance. Drawing from engineering research methodology, Tether
combines local activity monitoring, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and
gamification to offer real-time focus support and personalized dialogue. The
system integrates operating system level system tracking to prompt engagement
and its chatbot leverages ADHD-specific resources to offer relevant responses.
Preliminary validation through self-use revealed improved contextual accuracy
following iterative prompt refinements and RAG enhancements. Tether
differentiates itself from generic tools by being adaptable and aligned with
software-specific workflows and ADHD-related challenges. While not yet
evaluated by target users, this work lays the foundation for future
neurodiversity-aware tools in SE and highlights the potential of LLMs as
personalized support systems for underrepresented cognitive needs.

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework integrating statistical program analysis with Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate C program repairs with 44.93% repair accuracy, outperforming prior approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in automated program repair (APR) by integrating statistical program analysis with LLMs and improve debugging effectiveness for C programs.

Method: Combines spectrum-based fault localization, runtime feedback, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting into an iterative repair loop, where LLMs reason over failing tests, suspicious code areas, and patch outcomes.

Result: Achieved 44.93% repair accuracy on 3,902 Codeflaws benchmark bugs, showing a 3.61% improvement over state-of-the-art methods like GPT-4 with CoT.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a practical approach for leveraging the synergy of statistical program analysis and generative AI to advance automated debugging solutions.

Abstract: This study explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in
automating the repair of C programs. We present a framework that integrates
spectrum-based fault localization (SBFL), runtime feedback, and
Chain-of-Thought-structured prompting into an autonomous repair loop. Unlike
prior approaches, our method explicitly combines statistical program analysis
with LLM reasoning. The iterative repair cycle leverages a structured
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting approach, where the model reasons over failing
tests, suspicious code regions, and prior patch outcomes, before generating new
candidate patches. The model iteratively changes the code, evaluates the
results, and incorporates reasoning from previous attempts into subsequent
modifications, reducing repeated errors and clarifying why some bugs remain
unresolved. Our evaluation spans 3,902 bugs from the Codeflaws benchmark, where
our approach achieves 44.93% repair accuracy, representing a 3.61% absolute
improvement over strong state-of-the-art APR baselines such as GPT-4 with CoT.
This outcome highlights a practical pathway toward integrating statistical
program analysis with generative AI in automated debugging.

*Katrine Christensen,Mahsa Varshosaz,Raúl Pardo*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes ProbTest, a method for testing probabilistic programs using statistical guarantees, automating the requisite test executions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Testing probabilistic programs is challenging due to their inherent stochastic nature, requiring multiple executions to validate expected outcomes effectively.

Method: The authors developed ProbTest, a black-box unit testing method based on the coupon collector's problem, implemented as a PyTest plug-in for automated statistical testing of probabilistic programs.

Result: ProbTest successfully enables developers to test probabilistic programs with minimal manual overhead, demonstrated in case studies involving reinforcement learning and randomized data structures.

Conclusion: ProbTest facilitates effective and efficient testing of probabilistic programs while integrating seamlessly into existing Python-based testing workflows.

Abstract: Testing probabilistic programs is non-trivial due to their stochastic nature.
Given an input, the program may produce different outcomes depending on the
underlying stochastic choices in the program. This means testing the expected
outcomes of probabilistic programs requires repeated test executions unlike
deterministic programs where a single execution may suffice for each test
input. This raises the following question: how many times should we run a
probabilistic program to effectively test it? This work proposes a novel
black-box unit testing method, ProbTest, for testing the outcomes of
probabilistic programs. Our method is founded on the theory surrounding a
well-known combinatorial problem, the coupon collector's problem. Using this
method, developers can write unit tests as usual without extra effort while the
number of required test executions is determined automatically with statistical
guarantees for the results. We implement ProbTest as a plug-in for PyTest, a
well-known unit testing tool for python programs. Using this plug-in,
developers can write unit tests similar to any other Python program and the
necessary test executions are handled automatically. We evaluate the method on
case studies from the Gymnasium reinforcement learning library and a randomized
data structure.

Motivation: Determining thread-safety in object-oriented programming for Java classes is challenging, and this paper aims to address this by automating the process for scalable and reliable analysis.

Method: The authors define thread-safety based on data race freedom principles, devise properties ensuring thread-safety, and encode them into the CodeQL static analysis tool to automatically analyze Java source code.

Result: Evaluation was conducted on 1000 top GitHub repositories, analyzing over 3.6 million Java classes, detecting thousands of thread-safety errors, with scalable runtime for analysis.

Conclusion: The method proves highly scalable and applicable in real-world code bases and has gained positive feedback and integration traction within the developer community for improving concurrency error detection.

Abstract: In object-oriented languages software developers rely on thread-safe classes
to implement concurrent applications. However, determining whether a class is
thread-safe is a challenging task. This paper presents a highly scalable method
to analyze thread-safety in Java classes. We provide a definition of
thread-safety for Java classes founded on the correctness principle of the Java
memory model, data race freedom. We devise a set of properties for Java classes
that are proven to ensure thread-safety. We encode these properties in the
static analysis tool CodeQL to automatically analyze Java source code. We
perform an evaluation on the top 1000 GitHub repositories. The evaluation
comprises 3632865 Java classes; with 1992 classes annotated as @ThreadSafe from
71 repositories. These repositories include highly popular software such as
Apache Flink (24.6k stars), Facebook Fresco (17.1k stars), PrestoDB (16.2k
starts), and gRPC (11.6k starts). Our queries detected thousands of
thread-safety errors. The running time of our queries is below 2 minutes for
repositories up to 200k lines of code, 20k methods, 6000 fields, and 1200
classes. We have submitted a selection of detected concurrency errors as PRs,
and developers positively reacted to these PRs. We have submitted our CodeQL
queries to the main CodeQL repository, and they are currently in the process of
becoming available as part of GitHub actions. The results demonstrate the
applicability and scalability of our method to analyze thread-safety in
real-world code bases.

*Junda He,Zhou Yang,Jieke Shi,Chengran Yang,Kisub Kim,Bowen Xu,Xin Zhou,David Lo*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces CureFuzz, a curiosity-driven fuzz testing framework for identifying crash-triggering scenarios in sequential decision-making models (SDMs). It improves detection of faults and enhances the robustness of SDMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sequential decision-making models (SDMs) are prone to unsafe behaviors, making their testing essential, especially in safety-critical applications like autonomous driving.

Method: The CureFuzz framework uses a curiosity-driven mechanism and a multi-objective seed selection technique to explore novel and crash-triggering scenarios effectively.

Result: CureFuzz significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the number of detected faults and distinct crash-triggering scenarios, demonstrating its effectiveness experimentally.

Conclusion: CureFuzz is a powerful tool that enhances the testing and optimization of SDMs by discovering and addressing vulnerabilities, making SDMs safer and more reliable.

Abstract: Sequential decision-making processes (SDPs) are fundamental for complex
real-world challenges, such as autonomous driving, robotic control, and traffic
management. While recent advances in Deep Learning (DL) have led to mature
solutions for solving these complex problems, SDMs remain vulnerable to
learning unsafe behaviors, posing significant risks in safety-critical
applications. However, developing a testing framework for SDMs that can
identify a diverse set of crash-triggering scenarios remains an open challenge.
To address this, we propose CureFuzz, a novel curiosity-driven black-box fuzz
testing approach for SDMs. CureFuzz proposes a curiosity mechanism that allows
a fuzzer to effectively explore novel and diverse scenarios, leading to
improved detection of crashtriggering scenarios. Additionally, we introduce a
multi-objective seed selection technique to balance the exploration of novel
scenarios and the generation of crash-triggering scenarios, thereby optimizing
the fuzzing process. We evaluate CureFuzz on various SDMs and experimental
results demonstrate that CureFuzz outperforms the state-of-the-art method by a
substantial margin in the total number of faults and distinct types of
crash-triggering scenarios. We also demonstrate that the crash-triggering
scenarios found by CureFuzz can repair SDMs, highlighting CureFuzz as a
valuable tool for testing SDMs and optimizing their performance.

### [789] [Txt2Sce: Scenario Generation for Autonomous Driving System Testing Based on Textual Reports](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02150)
*Pin Ji,Yang Feng,Zongtai Li,Xiangchi Zhou,Jia Liu,Jun Sun,Zhihong Zhao*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper presents Txt2Sce, a framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to convert textual accident reports into OpenSCENARIO-compatible test scenarios for autonomous driving systems (ADSs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous Driving Systems (ADSs) still face challenges in complex situations despite technological advancements, leading to scenario-based testing becoming critical. A need exists to utilize real-world accident reports for testing, while addressing issues such as reliance on visual data, high manual workload, and lack of standardization in scenario generation.

Method: Txt2Sce generates test scenarios in OpenSCENARIO format from textual accident reports. It uses a Large Language Model (LLM) for text-to-scenario conversion and employs steps like disassembly, block mutation, and assembly to create scenario trees. These methods ensure derivation-based scenario variety and help identify conditions causing issues.

Result: Txt2Sce was tested by creating 33 scenario trees, leading to 4,373 scenarios to test an open-source ADS called Autoware. The system effectively transformed textual reports into valid OpenSCENARIO scenarios, improved scenario diversity through mutations, and detected safety and performance vulnerabilities in Autoware.

Conclusion: Txt2Sce successfully addresses the efficiency and portability challenges of scenario generation by converting accident reports into standardized OpenSCENARIO files. It enhances diversity in test scenarios and serves as a reliable tool for detecting issues in autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of deep learning and related technologies,
Autonomous Driving Systems (ADSs) have made significant progress and are
gradually being widely applied in safety-critical fields. However, numerous
accident reports show that ADSs still encounter challenges in complex
scenarios. As a result, scenario-based testing has become essential for
identifying defects and ensuring reliable performance. In particular,
real-world accident reports offer valuable high-risk scenarios for more
targeted ADS testing. Despite their potential, existing methods often rely on
visual data, which demands large memory and manual annotation. Additionally,
since existing methods do not adopt standardized scenario formats (e.g.,
OpenSCENARIO), the generated scenarios are often tied to specific platforms and
ADS implementations, limiting their scalability and portability. To address
these challenges, we propose Txt2Sce, a method for generating test scenarios in
OpenSCENARIO format based on textual accident reports. Txt2Sce first uses a LLM
to convert textual accident reports into corresponding OpenSCENARIO scenario
files. It then generates a derivation-based scenario file tree through scenario
disassembly, scenario block mutation, and scenario assembly. By utilizing the
derivation relationships between nodes in the scenario tree, Txt2Sce helps
developers identify the scenario conditions that trigger unexpected behaviors
of ADSs. In the experiments, we employ Txt2Sce to generate 33 scenario file
trees, resulting in a total of 4,373 scenario files for testing the open-source
ADS, Autoware. The experimental results show that Txt2Sce successfully converts
textual reports into valid OpenSCENARIO files, enhances scenario diversity
through mutation, and effectively detects unexpected behaviors of Autoware in
terms of safety, smartness, and smoothness.

*Martin Skoglund,Fredrik Warg,Anders Thorsén,Sasikumar Punnekkat,Hans Hansson*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a formal approach to define an Operational Design Domain (ODD) using the Pkl language, ensuring safety for automated functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of safety evaluations in autonomous systems that operate without human supervision by formalizing the ODD context.

Method: The authors propose using the Pkl language to specify ODDs, ensuring flexibility, consistency, and integration into development and assessment processes.

Result: The proposed approach addresses central challenges in ODD specification and improves usability.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates how formalizing ODDs with the Pkl language can help perform rigorous safety assessments, applicable across domains with an automotive use case as an example.

Abstract: The deployment of automated functions that can operate without direct human
supervision has changed safety evaluation in domains seeking higher levels of
automation. Unlike conventional systems that rely on human operators, these
functions require new assessment frameworks to demonstrate that they do not
introduce unacceptable risks under real-world conditions. To make a convincing
safety claim, the developer must present a thorough justification argument,
supported by evidence, that a function is free from unreasonable risk when
operated in its intended context. The key concept relevant to the presented
work is the intended context, often captured by an Operational Design Domain
specification (ODD). ODD formalization is challenging due to the need to
maintain flexibility in adopting diverse specification formats while preserving
consistency and traceability and integrating seamlessly into the development,
validation, and assessment. This paper presents a way to formalize an ODD in
the Pkl language, addressing central challenges in specifying ODDs while
improving usability through specialized configuration language features. The
approach is illustrated with an automotive example but can be broadly applied
to ensure rigorous assessments of operational contexts.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to evaluate test case suitability for CCAM system safety by extending ODD formalization and analyzing testing attributes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CCAM systems reshape safety assessment, needing new methods to evaluate automated functions beyond human-managed tasks.

Method: The paper extends an existing ODD framework with key testing attributes to integrate test environments' capabilities and supports automatic test-case suitability evaluation.

Result: Demonstrated with an automated truck reversing function, the system evaluates test environments based on object-detection sensors' capabilities.

Conclusion: The method facilitates automated allocation of safety tests, streamlining CCAM system evaluations and aligning requirements to testing capacities.

Abstract: The emergence of Connected, Cooperative, and Automated Mobility (CCAM)
systems has significantly transformed the safety assessment landscape. Because
they integrate automated vehicle functions beyond those managed by a human
driver, new methods are required to evaluate their safety. Approaches that
compile evidence from multiple test environments have been proposed for
type-approval and similar evaluations, emphasizing scenario coverage within the
systems Operational Design Domain (ODD). However, aligning diverse test
environment requirements with distinct testing capabilities remains
challenging. This paper presents a method for evaluating the suitability of
test case allocation to various test environments by drawing on and extending
an existing ODD formalization with key testing attributes. The resulting
construct integrates ODD parameters and additional test attributes to capture a
given test environments relevant capabilities. This approach supports automatic
suitability evaluation and is demonstrated through a case study on an automated
reversing truck function. The system's implementation fidelity is tied to ODD
parameters, facilitating automated test case allocation based on each
environments capacity for object-detection sensor assessment.

*Yicong Zhao,Shisong Chen,Jiacheng Zhang,Zhixu Li*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: ReCode is a framework for efficient and accurate code repair, using a modular dual-encoder and a new retrieval strategy, which outperforms traditional methods in accuracy and inference costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for code repair with LLMs have high computational costs and fail to efficiently utilize structural intricacies of code.

Method: ReCode combines an algorithm-aware retrieval strategy and a modular dual-encoder architecture for fine-grained semantic matching between code and retrieval contexts.

Result: ReCode achieves higher repair accuracy at lower inference cost compared to traditional approaches, validated on RACodeBench and programming datasets.

Conclusion: ReCode provides a scalable, realistic, and efficient solution for code repair, demonstrating practical applications in handling real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in code-related tasks, such as code generation and automated
program repair. Despite their promising performance, most existing approaches
for code repair suffer from high training costs or computationally expensive
inference. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), with its efficient in-context
learning paradigm, offers a more scalable alternative. However, conventional
retrieval strategies, which are often based on holistic code-text embeddings,
fail to capture the structural intricacies of code, resulting in suboptimal
retrieval quality. To address the above limitations, we propose ReCode, a
fine-grained retrieval-augmented in-context learning framework designed for
accurate and efficient code repair. Specifically, ReCode introduces two key
innovations: (1) an algorithm-aware retrieval strategy that narrows the search
space using preliminary algorithm type predictions; and (2) a modular
dual-encoder architecture that separately processes code and textual inputs,
enabling fine-grained semantic matching between input and retrieved contexts.
Furthermore, we propose RACodeBench, a new benchmark constructed from
real-world user-submitted buggy code, which addresses the limitations of
synthetic benchmarks and supports realistic evaluation. Experimental results on
RACodeBench and competitive programming datasets demonstrate that ReCode
achieves higher repair accuracy with significantly reduced inference cost,
highlighting its practical value for real-world code repair scenarios.

*Akshay K. Jagadish,Mirko Thalmann,Julian Coda-Forno,Marcel Binz,Eric Schulz*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper presents a computational framework called Ecologically Rational Meta-learned Inference (ERMI) that aligns human cognition with ecological structures and achieves superior predictive performance across various cognitive tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to understand whether human learning and decision-making are principled adaptations to real-world statistical environments and to ground cognitive models in ecological reality.

Method: The authors developed ERMI by integrating rational analysis with ecological grounding, leveraging large language models to generate tasks and using meta-learning algorithms for deriving optimal rational models.

Result: ERMI successfully predicts human behavior in 15 experiments involving function learning, category learning, and decision-making, outperforming established cognitive models in trial-by-trial predictions.

Conclusion: Human cognition may largely reflect adaptive alignment to the statistical and ecological structures of real-world problems, as demonstrated by ERMI.

Abstract: Human cognition is profoundly shaped by the environments in which it unfolds.
Yet, it remains an open question whether learning and decision making can be
explained as a principled adaptation to the statistical structure of real-world
tasks. We introduce ecologically rational analysis, a computational framework
that unifies the normative foundations of rational analysis with ecological
grounding. Leveraging large language models to generate ecologically valid
cognitive tasks at scale, and using meta-learning to derive rational models
optimized for these environments, we develop a new class of learning
algorithms: Ecologically Rational Meta-learned Inference (ERMI). ERMI
internalizes the statistical regularities of naturalistic problem spaces and
adapts flexibly to novel situations, without requiring hand-crafted heuristics
or explicit parameter updates. We show that ERMI captures human behavior across
15 experiments spanning function learning, category learning, and decision
making, outperforming several established cognitive models in trial-by-trial
prediction. Our results suggest that much of human cognition may reflect
adaptive alignment to the ecological structure of the problems we encounter in
everyday life.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: Analyzed EEG data with LSTM networks, achieving 93.3%-95% accuracy in diagnosing sleep disorders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the diagnosis of sleep disorders by leveraging brain signal analysis methods, particularly focusing on EEG.

Method: Utilized LSTM neural networks to analyze preprocessed EEG data extracted from a public dataset of 197 full-night sleep recordings.

Result: The LSTM models reached 93.3% accuracy in distinguishing healthy vs. disordered sleep, which increased to 95% with fusion techniques.

Conclusion: Deep learning models, especially LSTM and fusion methods, show strong potential for accurate and computationally efficient diagnosis of sleep disorders in clinical settings.

Abstract: Diagnosing sleep disorders is an important focus in neuroscience and
engineering, as these conditions involve issues such as insufficient sleep,
frequent awakenings, and difficulty reaching deep sleep. Accurate detection
based on brain signals, particularly electroencephalography (EEG), enables
development of personalized treatments. While statistical pattern recognition
was once the standard for analyzing EEG, deep learning has become the dominant
approach. In this study, we analyzed a public database of 197 full night sleep
recordings from participants aged 25-101 years. After preprocessing and feature
extraction, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks achieved 93.3%
accuracy in distinguishing healthy from disordered sleep, which improved to 95%
with fusion techniques. The models were also computationally efficient,
suggesting strong clinical potential for rapid and precise sleep disorder
diagnosis.

TL;DR: The paper reviews Integrated Information Theory, Neurorepresentationalism, and Active Inference, analyzing their claims, explanatory approaches, and testing methodologies, while emphasizing adversarial collaboration for theory comparison in consciousness research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neuroscientific theories of consciousness are rapidly emerging, creating the need to evaluate their similarities, discrepancies, and explanatory capacities.

Method: The authors compare three theories' explanatory scope and strategies, explore adversarial collaboration as a testing framework, and outline hypotheses and empirical testing protocols.

Result: Structured adversarial collaboration reveals differences in empirical predictions and facilitates the integration of experimental data to quantitatively measure support for each theory.

Conclusion: Adversarial collaboration provides a quantitative metric for assessing scientific progress and refining consciousness theories.

Abstract: As neuroscientific theories of consciousness continue to proliferate, the
need to assess their similarities and differences -- as well as their
predictive and explanatory power -- becomes ever more pressing. Recently, a
number of structured adversarial collaborations have been devised to test the
competing predictions of several candidate theories of consciousness. In this
review, we compare and contrast three theories being investigated in one such
adversarial collaboration: Integrated Information Theory,
Neurorepresentationalism, and Active Inference. We begin by presenting the core
claims of each theory, before comparing them in terms of (1) the phenomena they
seek to explain, (2) the sorts of explanations they avail, and (3) the
methodological strategies they endorse. We then consider some of the inherent
challenges of theory testing, and how adversarial collaboration addresses some
of these difficulties. More specifically, we outline the key hypotheses that
will be tested in this adversarial collaboration, and exemplify how contrasting
empirical predictions may pertain to core and auxiliary components of each
theory. Finally, we discuss how the data harvested across disparate experiments
(and their replicates) may be formally integrated to provide a quantitative
measure of the evidential support accrued under each theory. We suggest this
approach to theory comparison may afford a useful metric for tracking the
amount of scientific progress being made in consciousness research.

TL;DR: The paper studies the relationship between neural responsiveness and consciousness by analyzing ECoG recordings across wakefulness, anesthesia, and recovery in primates, using a recurrent neural network (RNN) to characterize cortical dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge in neuroscience of identifying neural correlates of consciousness by exploring a dynamical framework for understanding varying states of consciousness.

Method: The study analyzes intracranial ECoG recordings in primates during different states and fits cortical dynamics using a nonequilibrium recurrent neural network (RNN) to extract a neural response function as an indicator of dynamical complexity.

Result: The amplitude of the neural response function distinctly correlates with conscious states: strong responsiveness during wakefulness, suppressed during anesthesia, and gradual recovery indicating restoration of neural dynamics.

Conclusion: A brain-state-dependent neural response function is proposed as a necessary dynamical condition for consciousness, offering a framework to quantify consciousness using nonequilibrium brain responsiveness.

Abstract: Understanding the neural correlates of consciousness remains a central
challenge in neuroscience. In this study, we investigate the relationship
between consciousness and neural responsiveness by analyzing intracranial ECoG
recordings from non-human primates across three distinct states: wakefulness,
anesthesia, and recovery. Using a nonequilibrium recurrent neural network (RNN)
model, we fit state-dependent cortical dynamics to extract the neural response
function as a dynamics complexity indicator. Our findings demonstrate that the
amplitude of the neural response function serves as a robust dynamical
indicator of conscious state, consistent with the role of a linear response
function in statistical physics. Notably, this aligns with our previous
theoretical results showing that the response function in RNNs peaks near the
transition between ordered and chaotic regimes -- highlighting criticality as a
potential principle for sustaining flexible and responsive cortical dynamics.
Empirically, we find that during wakefulness, neural responsiveness is strong,
widely distributed, and consistent with rich nonequilibrium fluctuations. Under
anesthesia, response amplitudes are significantly suppressed, and the network
dynamics become more chaotic, indicating a loss of dynamical sensitivity.
During recovery, the neural response function is elevated, supporting the
gradual re-establishment of flexible and responsive activity that parallels the
restoration of conscious processing. Our work suggests that a robust,
brain-state-dependent neural response function may be a necessary dynamical
condition for consciousness, providing a principled framework for quantifying
levels of consciousness in terms of nonequilibrium responsiveness in the brain.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper discusses current limitations in understanding how the retina processes natural stimuli and suggests new strategies to enhance research in this area.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited understanding of retinal processing under complex, natural visual stimuli, and to explore methods to overcome challenges in modeling and interpreting these processes.

Method: The paper reviews challenges in modeling retinal responses to natural stimuli, proposes a novel approach of dividing complex visual scenes into visual tasks, and integrates biological constraints from connectomic studies into models.

Result: Emerging techniques like 'divide and conquer' strategies and biologically constrained models offer promising ways to tackle the complexity of retinal computations for natural stimuli.

Conclusion: Applying task-specific visual analysis and biologically informed modeling could revolutionize our ability to understand retinal processing in natural environments, with potential implications for other sensory areas.

Abstract: While a great deal is known about the way the retina processes simple
stimuli, our understanding of how the retina processes natural stimuli is still
limited. Here we highlight some of the challenges that remain to be addressed
to understand retinal processing of natural stimuli and describe emerging
research avenues to overcome them.
  A key issue is model complexity. When complexifying the probing stimuli
towards natural stimuli, the number of parameters required in models of retinal
computations increases, raising issues of overfitting, generalization, and
interpretability. This increase in complexity is also a challenge for normative
approaches as it makes it difficult to derive non-linear retinal computations
from simple principles.
  We describe two types of approaches that may help circumvent this issue in
the future. First, we propose that a new form of reductionism is emerging:
instead of breaking down natural stimuli into sums of simpler stimuli, it
becomes possible to 'divide and conquer' natural scenes into different visual
inputs corresponding to different visual tasks, in order to study retinal
computations separately for each of these visual tasks. Second, several studies
suggest that it will soon be possible to mitigate the issue of complexity, by
'embodying' the models with more biological constraints, in particularly those
derived from connectomic studies. Together, these approaches may offer a
powerful strategy to move beyond current limitations and advance our
understanding of how the retina processes natural visual environments, and
suggest approaches that could be used beyond, for other sensory areas.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diagnosing Parkinson's Disease (PD) early is critical, and eye movements may serve as an accessible and non-invasive indicator of neurodegeneration.

Method: A combination of fixation/saccade oculomotor features and gaze cluster-derived features from six visual tests is analyzed using machine learning classifiers and a Mixture of Experts ensemble model.

Result: Ensemble models outperform individual classifiers, achieving high predictive accuracy with an AUC of 0.95.

Conclusion: Visual exploration tasks offer a promising non-invasive method for early automated screening of Parkinson's Disease using gaze-based machine learning models.

Abstract: Eye movements can reveal early signs of neurodegeneration, including those
associated with Parkinson's Disease (PD). This work investigates the utility of
a set of gaze-based features for the automatic screening of PD from different
visual exploration tasks. For this purpose, a novel methodology is introduced,
combining classic fixation/saccade oculomotor features (e.g., saccade count,
fixation duration, scanned area) with features derived from gaze clusters
(i.e., regions with a considerable accumulation of fixations). These features
are automatically extracted from six exploration tests and evaluated using
different machine learning classifiers. A Mixture of Experts ensemble is used
to integrate outputs across tests and both eyes. Results show that ensemble
models outperform individual classifiers, achieving an Area Under the Receiving
Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.95 on a held-out test set. The
findings support visual exploration as a non-invasive tool for early automatic
screening of PD.

Conclusion: DCA offers individualized, functionally coherent, and spatially contiguous brain parcellations, marking an advancement in neuroimaging analysis and showing promise for diverse applications.

Abstract: Brain atlases are essential for reducing the dimensionality of neuroimaging

predefined, group-level templates with limited flexibility and resolution. We
present Deep Cluster Atlas (DCA), a graph-guided deep embedding clustering
framework for generating individualized, voxel-wise brain parcellations. DCA
combines a pretrained autoencoder with spatially regularized deep clustering to
produce functionally coherent and spatially contiguous regions. Our method
supports flexible control over resolution and anatomical scope, and generalizes
to arbitrary brain structures. We further introduce a standardized benchmarking
platform for atlas evaluation, using multiple large-scale fMRI datasets. Across
multiple datasets and scales, DCA outperforms state-of-the-art atlases,
improving functional homogeneity by 98.8\% and silhouette coefficient by 29\%,

*Charles J. Edelson,Sima Setayeshgar,William Bialek,Rob R. de Ruyter van Steveninck*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The study explores adaptation in a fly's motion-sensitive neuron to match its response rate to stimulus conditions, reducing redundancy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how the brain adapts to varying statistical structures in visual inputs and how neural responses adjust to different contrast dynamics.

Method: The researchers studied a motion-sensitive neuron in flies, presenting naturalistic stimuli with separated time scales, and measured responses using spike-triggered average velocity trajectories.

Result: The study found that neural responses depend on contrast, with context dependence occurring in a low-dimensional space governed by a single dominant dimension.

Conclusion: Adaptation in the neuron aligns its integration time with the mean interval between spikes, optimizing for reduced redundancy in neural response.

Abstract: Brains adapt to the statistical structure of their input. In the visual
system, local light intensities change rapidly, the variance of the intensity
changes more slowly, and the dynamic range of contrast itself changes more
slowly still. We use a motion-sensitive neuron in the fly visual system to
probe this hierarchy of adaptation phenomena, delivering naturalistic stimuli
that have been simplified to have a clear separation of time scales. We show
that the neural response to visual motion depends on contrast, and this
dependence itself varies with context. Using the spike-triggered average
velocity trajectory as a response measure, we find that context dependence is
confined to a low-dimensional space, with a single dominant dimension. Across a
wide range of conditions this adaptation serves to match the integration time
to the mean interval between spikes, reducing redundancy.

### [802] [On sources to variabilities of simple cells in the primary visual cortex: A principled theory for the interaction between geometric image transformations and receptive field responses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02139)
*Tony Lindeberg*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper explores a theory linking geometric image transformations with receptive field responses in a visual observer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how geometric transformations influence visual processing and align receptive field responses across varying viewing conditions.

Method: The paper develops theory based on uniform spatial scaling, spatial affine, Galilean, and temporal scaling transformations.

Result: The study shows receptive fields should be covariant and adaptable to geometric transformations to ensure consistent responses.

Conclusion: Receptive fields in the primary visual cortex may function in expanded shapes to align with varying geometric image transformations.

Abstract: This paper gives an overview of a theory for modelling the interaction
between geometric image transformations and receptive field responses for a
visual observer that views objects and spatio-temporal events in the
environment. This treatment is developed over combinations of (i) uniform
spatial scaling transformations, (ii) spatial affine transformations, (iii)
Galilean transformations and (iv) temporal scaling transformations.
  By postulating that the family of receptive fields should be covariant under
these classes of geometric image transformations, it follows that the receptive
field shapes should be expanded over the degrees of freedom of the
corresponding image transformations, to enable a formal matching between the
receptive field responses computed under different viewing conditions for the
same scene or for a structurally similar spatio-temporal event.
  We conclude the treatment by discussing and providing potential support for a
working hypothesis that the receptive fields of simple cells in the primary
visual cortex ought to be covariant under these classes of geometric image
transformations, and thus have the shapes of their receptive fields expanded
over the degrees of freedom of the corresponding geometric image
transformations.

### [803] [Improving Electroencephalogram-Based Deception Detection in Concealed Information Test under Low Stimulus Heterogeneity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02234)
*Suhye Kim,Jaehoon Cheon,Taehee Kim,Seok Chan Kim,Chang-Hwan Im*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper explores improving the concealed information test (CIT) for detecting deception using deep learning methods, showing that EEGNet achieves the highest accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The conventional BAD method struggles in real-world scenarios with low stimulus heterogeneity, limiting its applicability in deception detection.

Method: The study employed EEG data from realistic mock-crime investigations and compared traditional BAD analysis, machine learning algorithms, and deep learning methods like ShallowNet and EEGNet.

Result: EEGNet achieved the highest detection accuracy of 86.67% using a data augmentation approach, outperforming other methods.

Conclusion: Deep learning methods, particularly EEGNet, enhance deception detection capabilities in CIT, making it more effective for real-world applications.

Abstract: The concealed information test (CIT) is widely used for detecting deception
in criminal investigations, primarily leveraging the P300 component of
electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. However, the traditional bootstrapped
amplitude difference (BAD) method struggles to accurately differentiate
deceptive individuals from innocent ones when irrelevant stimuli carry
familiarity or inherent meaning, thus limiting its practical applicability in
real-world investigations. This study aimed to enhance the deception detection
capability of the P300-based CIT, particularly under conditions of low stimulus
heterogeneity. To closely simulate realistic investigative scenarios, we
designed a realistic mock-crime setup in which participants were familiarized
with all CIT stimuli except the target stimulus. EEG data acquired during CIT
sessions were analyzed using the BAD method, machine learning algorithms, and
deep learning (DL) methods (ShallowNet and EEGNet). Among these techniques,
EEGNet demonstrated the highest deception detection accuracy at 86.67%, when
employing our proposed data augmentation approach. Overall, DL methods could
significantly improve the accuracy of deception detection under challenging
conditions of low stimulus heterogeneity by effectively capturing subtle
cognitive responses not accessible through handcrafted features. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first study that employed DL approaches for
subject-independent deception classification using the CIT paradigm.

*Eloïse Touron,Pedro L. C. Rodrigues,Julyan Arbel,Nelle Varoquaux,Michael Arbel*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper presents a stochastic method to infer centromere locations in budding yeast using Hi-C data and simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Centromere locations in yeast remain largely unknown, despite their essential role in chromosome segregation and folding, and difficulty persists in pinpointing them using conventional methods.

Method: The authors propose a novel stochastic approach leveraging both experimental Hi-C contact maps and simulated data to infer centromere locations.

Result: The method offers a way to overcome the reliance on pre-localization steps and provides inferred centromere locations in budding yeast.

Conclusion: A stochastic framework can effectively utilize Hi-C data for accurate centromere detection, potentially advancing chromosome structure studies in yeasts.

Abstract: The chromatin folding and the spatial arrangement of chromosomes in the cell
play a crucial role in DNA replication and genes expression. An improper
chromatin folding could lead to malfunctions and, over time, diseases. For
eukaryotes, centromeres are essential for proper chromosome segregation and
folding. Despite extensive research using de novo sequencing of genomes and
annotation analysis, centromere locations in yeasts remain difficult to infer
and are still unknown in most species. Recently, genome-wide chromosome
conformation capture coupled with next-generation sequencing (Hi-C) has become
one of the leading methods to investigate chromosome structures. Some recent
studies have used Hi-C data to give a point estimate of each centromere, but
those approaches highly rely on a good pre-localization. Here, we present a
novel approach that infers in a stochastic manner the locations of all
centromeres in budding yeast based on both the experimental Hi-C map and
simulated contact maps.

*Erwan Dereure,Emmanuel Akame Mfoumou,David Holcman*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces a probabilistic method using diameter-shrinkage ratios to assess tail behavior and geometric stability in data, offering better performance in noisy or small-sample environments compared to classical approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a tool for robust distributional inference and cluster validation that works effectively in small-sample or noisy conditions.

Method: The paper derives analytical expressions for diameter-shrinkage ratios based on the uniform and Gaussian hypotheses and introduces a decision rule that uses these ratios for sample classification. The method is integrated into clustering frameworks like DBSCAN.

Result: The proposed method outperforms the classical likelihood-ratio test in classification tasks within noisy or small-sample regimes, while maintaining consistency with larger datasets. It also validates clusters without requiring density estimation or parameter tuning.

Conclusion: The method provides theoretical and practical advancements, improving classification accuracy and cluster stability analysis in one-dimensional data scenarios.

Abstract: We develop a probabilistic method for assessing the tail behavior and
geometric stability of one-dimensional n i.i.d. samples by tracking how their
span contracts when the most extreme points are trimmed. Central to our
approach is the diameter-shrinkage ratio, that quantifies the relative
reduction in data range as extreme points are successively removed. We derive
analytical expressions, including finite-sample corrections, for the expected
shrinkage under both the uniform and Gaussian hypotheses, and establish that
these curves remain distinct even for moderate number of removal. We construct
an elementary decision rule that assigns a sample to whichever theoretical
shrinkage profile it most closely follows. This test achieves higher
classification accuracy than the classical likelihood-ratio test in
small-sample or noisy regimes, while preserving asymptotic consistency for
large n. We further integrate our criterion into a clustering pipeline (e.g.
DBSCAN), demonstrating its ability to validate one-dimensional clusters without
any density estimation or parameter tuning. This work thus provides both
theoretical insight and practical tools for robust distributional inference and
cluster stability analysis.

### [806] [Beyond Universal Approximation Theorems: Algorithmic Uniform Approximation by Neural Networks Trained with Noisy Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00924)
*Anastasis Kratsios,Tin Sum Cheng,Daniel Roy*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a randomized training framework for neural networks to achieve optimal generalization while accounting for noisy data, bridging theory with real-world practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current universal approximation theorems lack practical relevancy, as they assume noiseless data and neglect algorithmic realism.

Method: The approach involves an architecture-specific randomized training algorithm ensuring uniform approximation with noisy data, achieving minimax-optimality in trainable parameters.

Result: Trained models replicate key practical behaviors such as sub-linear parametric complexity in fine-tuning, exact interpolation of training data, and reasonable Lipschitz regularity.

Conclusion: The framework narrows the gap between theoretical universal approximation theorems and practical neural network behaviors, urging exploration of stochastic gradient descent for similar guarantees.

Abstract: At its core, machine learning seeks to train models that reliably generalize
beyond noisy observations; however, the theoretical vacuum in which
state-of-the-art universal approximation theorems (UATs) operate isolates them
from this goal, as they assume noiseless data and allow network parameters to
be chosen freely, independent of algorithmic realism. This paper bridges that
gap by introducing an architecture-specific randomized training algorithm that
constructs a uniform approximator from $N$ noisy training samples on the
$d$-dimensional cube $[0,1]^d$. Our trained neural networks attain the
minimax-optimal quantity of \textit{trainable} (non-random) parameters, subject
to logarithmic factors which vanish under the idealized noiseless sampling
assumed in classical UATs.
  Additionally, our trained models replicate key behaviours of real-world
neural networks, absent in standard UAT constructions, by: (1) exhibiting
sub-linear parametric complexity when fine-tuning on structurally related and
favourable out-of-distribution tasks, (2) exactly interpolating the training
data, and (3) maintaining reasonable Lipschitz regularity (after the initial
clustering attention layer). These properties bring state-of-the-art UATs
closer to practical machine learning, shifting the central open question from
algorithmic implementability with noisy samples to whether stochastic gradient
descent can achieve comparable guarantees.

*Jared D. Fisher*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces probit monotone Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) for modeling conditional mean functions for binary outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the capabilities of monotone BART in addressing binary outcome variable prediction by adapting the method.

Method: Developed a probit monotone BART that extends monotone BART to handle binary outcome variables.

Result: Demonstrated a novel approach that builds upon monotone BART, adapting it for binary data modeling.

Conclusion: Probit monotone BART provides a more specialized and accurate framework for estimating conditional mean functions in binary settings.

Abstract: Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) of Chipman et al. (2010) has proven
to be a powerful tool for nonparametric modeling and prediction. Monotone BART
(Chipman et al., 2022) is a recent development that allows BART to be more
precise in estimating monotonic functions. We further these developments by
proposing probit monotone BART, which allows the monotone BART framework to
estimate conditional mean functions when the outcome variable is binary.

### [808] [The Nondecreasing Rank](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00265)
*Andrew McCormack*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces the concept of Nondecreasing (ND) rank for matrices and tensors, explores its theoretical properties, and applies it to datasets using modified algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in representing matrices and tensors in ways that satisfy monotonicity constraints, a need evident in various real-world datasets.

Method: The authors propose defining ND rank for matrices and tensors, develop theoretical concepts for its characterization, and introduce a modified hierarchical alternating least squares algorithm to compute low ND rank approximations.

Result: Key findings include the equivalence between ND rank and transformed tensor nonnegative rank for certain poset orderings, properties like typical and maximum ND ranks, and constructing ND rank factorizations for specific datasets.

Conclusion: The presented ND rank framework extends the understanding of tensor representations under monotonicity constraints, with promising applications demonstrated in real-world data analysis.

Abstract: In this article the notion of the nondecreasing (ND) rank of a matrix or
tensor is introduced. A tensor has an ND rank of r if it can be represented as
a sum of r outer products of vectors, with each vector satisfying a
monotonicity constraint. It is shown that for certain poset orderings finding
an ND factorization of rank $r$ is equivalent to finding a nonnegative rank-r
factorization of a transformed tensor. However, not every tensor that is
monotonic has a finite ND rank. Theory is developed describing the properties
of the ND rank, including typical, maximum, and border ND ranks. Highlighted
also are the special settings where a matrix or tensor has an ND rank of one or
two. As a means of finding low ND rank approximations to a data tensor we
introduce a variant of the hierarchical alternating least squares algorithm.
Low ND rank factorizations are found and interpreted for two datasets
concerning the weight of pigs and a mental health survey during the COVID-19
pandemic.

*Xinwen Liu,Lei Qian,Song Xi Chen,Niansheng Tang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces PFD-BDCM, a framework devised for causal inference considering unmeasured confounders with both spatial and temporal variations. It blends spatio-temporal dynamics modeling with multi-resolution variables analysis, showing superior performance in evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for causal inference struggle with unmeasured confounders that exhibit spatial and temporal dynamics. Additionally, challenges arise from analyzing variables observed at different resolutions.

Method: The PFD-BDCM integrates valid backdoor adjustment sets into a diffusion-based mechanism, employs region-specific structural equations and autoregressive processes, and uses functional data expansions for heterogeneous resolutions. Error bounds for counterfactual estimates are theoretically established under certain assumptions.

Result: Empirical tests on synthetic and real-world air pollution datasets showed that PFD-BDCM outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in addressing spatio-temporal causal inference challenges.

Conclusion: The proposed PFD-BDCM framework effectively handles limitations in current causal inference approaches, ensuring high accuracy in counterfactual estimates and addressing biases arising from unmeasured confounders.

Abstract: We introduce a Partial Functional Dynamic Backdoor Diffusion-based Causal
Model (PFD-BDCM), specifically designed for causal inference in the presence of
unmeasured confounders with spatial heterogeneity and temporal dependency. The
proposed PFD-BDCM framework addresses the restrictions of the existing
approaches by uniquely integrating models for complex spatio-temporal dynamics
with the analysis of multi-resolution variables. Specifically, the framework
systematically mitigates confounding bias by integrating valid backdoor
adjustment sets into a diffusion-based sampling mechanism. Moreover, it
accounts for the intricate dynamics of unmeasured confounders through the
deployment of region-specific structural equations and conditional
autoregressive processes, and accommodates variables observed at heterogeneous
resolutions via basis expansions for functional data. Our theoretical analysis
establishes error bounds for counterfactual estimates of PFD-BDCM, formally
linking reconstruction accuracy to counterfactual fidelity under monotonicity
assumptions of structural equation and invertibility assumptions of encoding
function. Empirical evaluations on synthetic datasets and real-world air
pollution data demonstrate PFD-BDCM's superiority over existing methods.

### [810] [Identifying Causal Direction via Dense Functional Classes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00538)
*Katerina Hlavackova-Schindler,Suzana Marsela*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces LCUBE, a causal inference method based on the Minimum Description Length principle using cubic regression splines, to determine the causal direction between two variables and demonstrates superior precision compared to multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding causal relationships is crucial for scientific investigations, but determining causality between two continuous variables often relies on strong assumptions. The motivation is to develop a reliable and interpretable method under relaxed assumptions, without needing Gaussian noise.

Method: The authors propose a Minimum Description Length (MDL)-based score system using cubic regression splines with a density property, enabling evaluations of causal direction. They introduce LCUBE, a fast and interpretable approach with only one hyperparameter.

Result: Empirical evaluations show that LCUBE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of AUDRC and average precision across multiple datasets, including the Tuebingen cause-effect pairs dataset and other benchmarks.

Conclusion: LCUBE is a reliable, interpretable, and efficient method for causal inference with broad applicability and superior precision across diverse datasets.

Abstract: We address the problem of determining the causal direction between two
univariate, continuous-valued variables, X and Y, under the assumption of no
hidden confounders. In general, it is not possible to make definitive
statements about causality without some assumptions on the underlying model. To
distinguish between cause and effect, we propose a bivariate causal score based
on the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle, using functions that possess
the density property on a compact real interval. We prove the identifiability
of these causal scores under specific conditions. These conditions can be
easily tested. Gaussianity of the noise in the causal model equations is not
assumed, only that the noise is low. The well-studied class of cubic splines
possesses the density property on a compact real interval. We propose LCUBE as
an instantiation of the MDL-based causal score utilizing cubic regression
splines. LCUBE is an identifiable method that is also interpretable, simple,
and very fast. It has only one hyperparameter. Empirical evaluations compared
to state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that LCUBE achieves superior precision
in terms of AUDRC on the real-world Tuebingen cause-effect pairs dataset. It
also shows superior average precision across common 10 benchmark datasets and
achieves above average precision on 13 datasets.

*David Hirnschall*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces a deep generative semi-supervised learning framework using GANs for detecting credit card fraud in time series data, tackling challenges like irregular sampling, limited labeled data, and varying sequence lengths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of traditional fraud detection methods that require extensive labeled data and struggle with time series data complexities like irregular sampling frequencies and varying sequence lengths.

Method: The method uses conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for data augmentation, incorporates Bayesian inference for uncertainty quantification, and employs log-signatures for robust feature encoding. It introduces a Wasserstein distance-based loss to align generated and real data while maximizing classification accuracy.

Result: The framework was tested on the BankSim dataset, demonstrating consistent performance improvements under varying proportions of labeled data compared to benchmark methods, using both statistical and domain-specific metrics.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the value of GAN-driven semi-supervised models with log-signatures for handling irregular time series data, emphasizing their ability to make uncertainty-informed and accurate predictions in credit card fraud detection.

Abstract: We present a novel deep generative semi-supervised framework for credit card
fraud detection, formulated as time series classification task. As financial
transaction data streams grow in scale and complexity, traditional methods
often require large labeled datasets, struggle with time series of irregular
sampling frequencies and varying sequence lengths. To address these challenges,
we extend conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for targeted data
augmentation, integrate Bayesian inference to obtain predictive distributions
and quantify uncertainty, and leverage log-signatures for robust feature
encoding of transaction histories. We introduce a novel Wasserstein
distance-based loss to align generated and real unlabeled samples while
simultaneously maximizing classification accuracy on labeled data. Our approach
is evaluated on the BankSim dataset, a widely used simulator for credit card
transaction data, under varying proportions of labeled samples, demonstrating
consistent improvements over benchmarks in both global statistical and
domain-specific metrics. These findings highlight the effectiveness of
GAN-driven semi-supervised learning with log-signatures for irregularly sampled
time series and emphasize the importance of uncertainty-aware predictions.

*Deepak Bastola,Woohyeok Choi*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper proposes a hybrid text classification method for legal documents combining Top2Vec for semantic embeddings and Node2Vec for graph embeddings, outperforming traditional models like LDA and NMF.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Legal texts are difficult to classify due to unique language structures and limited labeled datasets.

Method: Combining Top2Vec for semantic embeddings, Node2Vec for graph embeddings, and KMeans clustering, followed by evaluations on clustering quality and sensitivity analyses.

Result: The hybrid approach (Top2Vec+Node2Vec) improves clustering quality, showing better performance compared to text-only or graph-only baselines.

Conclusion: The method is promising for legal data analysis, but further domain-specific adaptations and validations are needed for practical legal applications.

Abstract: Legal documents pose unique challenges for text classification due to their
domain-specific language and often limited labeled data. This paper proposes a
hybrid approach for classifying legal texts by combining unsupervised topic and
graph embeddings with a supervised model. We employ Top2Vec to learn semantic
document embeddings and automatically discover latent topics, and Node2Vec to
capture structural relationships via a bipartite graph of legal documents. The
embeddings are combined and clustered using KMeans, yielding coherent groupings
of documents. Our computations on a legal document dataset demonstrate that the
combined Top2Vec+Node2Vec approach improves clustering quality over text-only
or graph-only embeddings. We conduct a sensitivity analysis of hyperparameters,
such as the number of clusters and the dimensionality of the embeddings, and
demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance against baseline
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
models. Key findings indicate that while the pipeline presents an innovative
approach to unsupervised legal document analysis by combining semantic topic
modeling with graph embedding techniques, its efficacy is contingent upon the
quality of initial topic generation and the representational power of the
chosen embedding models for specialized legal language. Strategic
recommendations include the exploration of domain-specific embeddings, more
comprehensive hyperparameter tuning for Node2Vec, dynamic determination of
cluster numbers, and robust human-in-the-loop validation processes to enhance
legal relevance and trustworthiness. The pipeline demonstrates potential for
exploratory legal data analysis and as a precursor to supervised learning tasks
but requires further refinement and domain-specific adaptation for practical
legal applications.

*Yifan Chen,Eric Vanden-Eijnden,Jiawei Xu*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper investigates interpolation schedules in stochastic interpolants for generative models, focusing on numerical efficiency rather than statistical criteria. A method to optimize numerical properties is proposed, yielding substantial improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the numerical efficiency of flow and diffusion-based generative models by focusing on better drift field design, rather than relying purely on statistical optimization criteria.

Method: The authors design a criterion based on minimizing averaged squared Lipschitzness for drift fields. Additionally, they derive a formula to transfer between interpolation schedules without the need for neural network retraining.

Result: For Gaussian distributions, optimized schedules significantly improve Lipschitz constants compared to linear schedules. For Gaussian mixtures, they reduce mode collapse in few-step sampling. Validation on high-dimensional equations, like stochastic Allen-Cahn and Navier-Stokes, shows good performance.

Conclusion: Optimizing interpolation schedules based on numerical properties (e.g., Lipschitzness) leads to robust performance improvements and provides a generalizable strategy for generative model design.

Abstract: We study the design of interpolation schedules in the stochastic interpolants
framework for flow and diffusion-based generative models. We show that while
all scalar interpolation schedules achieve identical statistical efficiency
under Kullback-Leibler divergence in path space after optimal diffusion
coefficient tuning, their numerical efficiency can differ substantially. This
observation motivates focusing on numerical properties of the resulting drift
fields rather than statistical criteria for schedule design. We propose
averaged squared Lipschitzness minimization as a principled criterion for
numerical optimization, providing an alternative to kinetic energy minimization
used in optimal transport approaches. A transfer formula is derived that
enables conversion between different schedules at inference time without
retraining neural networks. For Gaussian distributions, our optimized schedules
achieve exponential improvements in Lipschitz constants over standard linear
schedules, while for Gaussian mixtures, they reduce mode collapse in few-step
sampling. We also validate our approach on high-dimensional invariant
distributions from stochastic Allen-Cahn equations and Navier-Stokes equations,
demonstrating robust performance improvements across resolutions.

*Hong Ye Tan,Stanley Osher,Wuchen Li*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes a noise-free sampling method governed by preconditioning and score function approximations, applied to diverse tasks and showing competitive results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance particle-based sampling methods by introducing noise-free mechanisms and addressing challenges in stability and convergence.

Method: The approach involves using a preconditioned regularized Wasserstein proximal operator, coupled with kernel formulation and a Cole-Hopf transformation for score function approximation. The method finds links with transformer architectures and introduces a discrete-time analysis for certain cases.

Result: The method exhibits stable, accelerated performance in both log-concave and non-log-concave distributions, and shows competitive results in tasks like Bayesian regularized image deconvolution and Bayesian neural network training.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates improvement in sampling efficiency and stability through preconditioning, offering potential for broader applications in computational and Bayesian problems.

Abstract: We consider sampling from a Gibbs distribution by evolving finitely many
particles. We propose a preconditioned version of a recently proposed
noise-free sampling method, governed by approximating the score function with
the numerically tractable score of a regularized Wasserstein proximal operator.
This is derived by a Cole--Hopf transformation on coupled anisotropic heat
equations, yielding a kernel formulation for the preconditioned regularized
Wasserstein proximal. The diffusion component of the proposed method is also
interpreted as a modified self-attention block, as in transformer
architectures. For quadratic potentials, we provide a discrete-time
non-asymptotic convergence analysis and explicitly characterize the bias, which
is dependent on regularization and independent of step-size. Experiments
demonstrate acceleration and particle-level stability on various log-concave
and non-log-concave toy examples to Bayesian total-variation regularized image
deconvolution, and competitive/better performance on non-convex Bayesian neural
network training when utilizing variable preconditioning matrices.

*Youssef Chaabouni,David Gamarnik*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper explores sparse signal recovery using noisy and sparse measurement matrices, presenting a phase transition threshold and examining measurement sparsity's trade-offs in sampling complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To fill the gap in understanding support recovery of sparse signals under sparse measurement conditions rather than dense matrices.

Method: The paper derives information-theoretic thresholds for successful sparse recovery and analyzes the trade-offs in sampling complexity influenced by measurement sparsity.

Result: The study establishes critical thresholds for sparse recovery based on factors like sparsity, signal dimension, and measurement sparsity, while highlighting sample size inflation due to sparsity constraints.

Conclusion: Sparse recovery requires careful balance between measurement sparsity and sampling complexity, offering theoretical insights but pending validation of integrability conjecture for extreme cases.

Abstract: We consider the problem of recovering the support of a sparse signal using
noisy projections. While extensive work has been done on the dense measurement
matrix setting, the sparse setting remains less explored. In this work, we
establish sufficient conditions on the sample size for successful sparse
recovery using sparse measurement matrices. Bringing together our result with
previously known necessary conditions, we discover that, in the regime where
$ds/p \rightarrow +\infty$, sparse recovery in the sparse setting exhibits a
phase transition at an information-theoretic threshold of
$n_{\text{INF}}^{\text{SP}} =
\Theta\left(s\log\left(p/s\right)/\log\left(ds/p\right)\right)$, where $p$
denotes the signal dimension, $s$ the number of non-zero components of the
signal, and $d$ the expected number of non-zero components per row of
measurement. This expression makes the price of sparsity explicit: restricting
each measurement to $d$ non-zeros inflates the required sample size by a factor
of $\log{s}/\log\left(ds/p\right)$, revealing a precise trade-off between
sampling complexity and measurement sparsity. Additionally, we examine the
effect of sparsifying an originally dense measurement matrix on sparse signal
recovery. We prove in the regime of $s = \alpha p$ and $d = \psi p$ with
$\alpha, \psi \in \left(0,1\right)$ and $\psi$ small that a sample of size
$n^{\text{Sp-ified}}_{\text{INF}} = \Theta\left(p / \psi^2\right)$ is
sufficient for recovery, subject to a certain uniform integrability conjecture,
the proof of which is work in progress.

*Haijie Xu,Chen Zhang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper focuses on designing experimental strategies to identify causal graph structures with cycles and bidirected edges, addressing challenges from latent confounders and observational data limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in identifying causal graphs when cycles and latent confounders are present, as observational methods alone or traditional CI tests may fail.

Method: The paper derives lower bounds for the number of interventions and experiments needed, and proposes two classes of algorithms (bounded and unbounded) using CI tests, do-see tests, and separation measures.

Result: The proposed algorithms can accurately identify all causal edges except for double-adjacent bidirected edges and are proven to align well with theoretical lower bounds.

Conclusion: The study offers efficient and theoretically sound methods for causal graph recovery under challenging conditions, filling gaps in the existing methods.

Abstract: We study the problem of experimental design for accurately identifying the
causal graph structure of a simple structural causal model (SCM), where the
underlying graph may include both cycles and bidirected edges induced by latent
confounders. The presence of cycles renders it impossible to recover the graph
skeleton using observational data alone, while confounding can further
invalidate traditional conditional independence (CI) tests in certain
scenarios. To address these challenges, we establish lower bounds on both the
maximum number of variables that can be intervened upon in a single experiment
and the total number of experiments required to identify all directed edges and
non-adjacent bidirected edges. Leveraging both CI tests and do see tests, and
accounting for $d$ separation and $\sigma$ separation, we develop two classes
of algorithms, i.e., bounded and unbounded, that can recover all causal edges
except for double adjacent bidirected edges. We further show that, up to
logarithmic factors, the proposed algorithms are tight with respect to the
derived lower bounds.

*Sakshi Arya,Wentao Lin*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces bandit algorithms that integrate domain-specific knowledge for better decision-making in agriculture under uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimize agricultural resource input decisions under uncertainty and limited data without relying solely on standard models.

Method: Develop nonlinear, model-based bandit algorithms embedding domain-specific response curves, combining uncertainty quantification and profit optimization.

Result: Algorithms improved decision-making vs. linear and nonparametric baselines in simulations with sublinear regret and low sample complexity.

Conclusion: This method supports sustainable, resource-efficient practices in agriculture by embedding mechanistic insights over data-heavy approaches, aligning with SDG 2 and SDG 12.

Abstract: Sequential decision-making is central to sustainable agricultural management
and precision agriculture, where resource inputs must be optimized under
uncertainty and over time. However, such decisions must often be made with
limited observations, whereas classical bandit and reinforcement learning
approaches typically rely on either linear or black-box reward models that may
misrepresent domain knowledge or require large amounts of data. We propose a
family of nonlinear, model-based bandit algorithms that embed domain-specific
response curves directly into the exploration-exploitation loop. By coupling
(i) principled uncertainty quantification with (ii) closed-form or rapidly
computable profit optima, these algorithms achieve sublinear regret and
near-optimal sample complexity while preserving interpretability. Theoretical
analysis establishes regret and sample complexity bounds, and extensive
simulations emulating real-world fertilizer-rate decisions show consistent
improvements over both linear and nonparametric baselines (such as linear UCB
and $k$-NN UCB) in the low-sample regime, under both well-specified and
shape-compatible misspecified models. Because our approach leverages
mechanistic insight rather than large data volumes, it is especially suited to
resource-constrained settings, supporting sustainable, inclusive, and
transparent sequential decision-making across agriculture, environmental
management, and allied applications. This methodology directly contributes to
SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) and SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) by
enabling data-driven, less wasteful agricultural practices.

### [818] [Inference in Spreading Processes with Neural-Network Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02073)
*Davide Ghio,Fabrizio Boncoraglio,Lenka Zdeborová*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper uses neural networks to model initial node states in stochastic graph processes, proposing a hybrid BP-AMP algorithm to improve state and trajectory recovery by integrating node covariate information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods assume random i.i.d. initial states for nodes in stochastic processes, which is often unrealistic. This paper seeks to model initial states as functions of covariate variables to better align with practical scenarios.

Method: The initial state of nodes is modeled using a single-layer perceptron based on their covariate variables. A Bayesian framework is developed, combining belief propagation and approximate message passing (BP-AMP) to integrate both spreading dynamics and covariate information.

Result: The proposed model enhances recovery of initial states and spreading trajectories. It also reveals first-order phase transitions under certain conditions, showing a statistical-to-computational gap where perfect recovery proves computationally infeasible despite theoretical possibilities.

Conclusion: Incorporating node covariate information into stochastic process modeling improves inference accuracy but faces computational limitations in some regimes, highlighting the trade-offs in realistic applications.

Abstract: Stochastic processes on graphs are a powerful tool for modelling complex
dynamical systems such as epidemics. A recent line of work focused on the
inference problem where one aims to estimate the state of every node at every
time, starting from partial observation of a subset of nodes at a subset of
times. In these works, the initial state of the process was assumed to be
random i.i.d. over nodes. Such an assumption may not be realistic in practice,
where one may have access to a set of covariate variables for every node that
influence the initial state of the system. In this work, we will assume that
the initial state of a node is an unknown function of such covariate variables.
Given that functions can be represented by neural networks, we will study a
model where the initial state is given by a simple neural network -- notably
the single-layer perceptron acting on the known node-wise covariate variables.
  Within a Bayesian framework, we study how such neural-network prior
information enhances the recovery of initial states and spreading trajectories.
We derive a hybrid belief propagation and approximate message passing (BP-AMP)
algorithm that handles both the spreading dynamics and the information included
in the node covariates, and we assess its performance against the estimators
that either use only the spreading information or use only the information from
the covariate variables.
  We show that in some regimes, the model can exhibit first-order phase
transitions when using a Rademacher distribution for the neural-network
weights. These transitions create a statistical-to-computational gap where even
the BP-AMP algorithm, despite the theoretical possibility of perfect recovery,
fails to achieve it.

*Yevhen Havrylenko,Meelis Käärik,Artur Tuttar*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper evaluates synthetic-data generation methods for actuarial ratemaking using Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) and compares it to other generative models. Findings show MICE creates high-quality and user-friendly synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Access to high-quality data for actuarial ratemaking is often restricted due to issues like cost and privacy. This paper aims to address these limitations by exploring synthetic-data generation.

Method: The study evaluates the MICE approach alongside Variational Autoencoders and Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks, using an open-source dataset to assess the preservation of variable distributions, relationships, and GLM performance.

Result: MICE-based methods are shown to generate high-quality synthetic tabular data and outperform other generative approaches in user-friendliness. Synthetic data also helps improve GLM prediction when augmenting the original dataset.

Conclusion: MICE is a promising method for generating synthetic data in actuarial contexts, preserving statistical properties and being more practical for users than other generative models.

Abstract: Actuarial ratemaking depends on high-quality data, yet access to such data is
often limited by the cost of obtaining new data, privacy concerns, etc. In this
paper, we explore synthetic-data generation as a potential solution to these
issues. In addition to discussing generative methods previously studied in the
actuarial literature, we introduce to the insurance community another approach
based on Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE). We present a
comparative study using an open-source dataset and evaluating MICE-based models
against other generative models like Variational Autoencoders and Conditional
Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks. We assess how well synthetic data
preserves the original marginal distributions of variables as well as the
multivariate relationships among covariates. We also investigate the
consistency between Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) trained on synthetic data
with GLMs trained on the original data. Furthermore, we assess the ease of use
of each generative approach and study the impact of augmenting original data
with synthetic data on the performance of GLMs for predicting claim counts. Our
results highlight the potential of MICE-based methods in creating high-quality
tabular data while being more user-friendly than the other methods.

### [820] [Variational Uncertainty Decomposition for In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02327)
*I. Shavindra Jayasekera,Jacob Si,Wenlong Chen,Filippo Valdettaro,A. Aldo Faisal,Yingzhen Li*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper proposes a variational framework for decomposing uncertainties in in-context learning using large language models (LLMs), addressing both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to better understand and address the uncertainties in in-context learning by LLMs, particularly by differentiating epistemic uncertainty (due to lack of in-context data) and aleatoric uncertainty (inherent to the prediction task).

Method: The authors introduce a variational uncertainty decomposition framework that avoids explicit sampling from the latent parameter posterior, instead optimizing auxiliary queries to estimate upper and lower bounds on aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties respectively.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world tasks demonstrate that the framework provides meaningful and interpretable decompositions of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully decomposes uncertainties in LLM in-context learning, enhancing understanding of predictive reliability and potentially contributing to improved applications.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) gain popularity in conducting prediction
tasks in-context, understanding the sources of uncertainty in in-context
learning becomes essential to ensuring reliability. The recent hypothesis of
in-context learning performing predictive Bayesian inference opens the avenue
for Bayesian uncertainty estimation, particularly for decomposing uncertainty
into epistemic uncertainty due to lack of in-context data and aleatoric
uncertainty inherent in the in-context prediction task. However, the
decomposition idea remains under-explored due to the intractability of the
latent parameter posterior from the underlying Bayesian model. In this work, we
introduce a variational uncertainty decomposition framework for in-context
learning without explicitly sampling from the latent parameter posterior, by
optimising auxiliary queries as probes to obtain an upper bound to the
aleatoric uncertainty of an LLM's in-context learning procedure, which also
induces a lower bound to the epistemic uncertainty. Through experiments on
synthetic and real-world tasks, we show quantitatively and qualitatively that
the decomposed uncertainties obtained from our method exhibit desirable
properties of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty.

### [821] [Distribution estimation via Flow Matching with Lipschitz guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02337)
*Lea Kunkel*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper delves into flow matching in generative modeling, improving theoretical convergence rates in high-dimensional scenarios without requiring log-concavity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of mathematical understanding of the statistical power of flow matching, particularly with the sensitivity of theoretical bounds to the Lipschitz constant.

Method: The study analyzes the assumptions for controlling the dependency on the vector field's Lipschitz constant and derives an improved convergence rate for the Wasserstein-1 distance.

Result: Authors present a high-dimensional convergence rate for the Wasserstein-1 distance, applicable to certain unbounded distributions without the need for log-concavity.

Conclusion: The findings advance the theoretical understanding of flow matching in generative modeling, expanding its applicability to broader distribution classes.

Abstract: Flow Matching, a promising approach in generative modeling, has recently
gained popularity. Relying on ordinary differential equations, it offers a
simple and flexible alternative to diffusion models, which are currently the
state-of-the-art. Despite its empirical success, the mathematical understanding
of its statistical power so far is very limited. This is largely due to the
sensitivity of theoretical bounds to the Lipschitz constant of the vector field
which drives the ODE. In this work, we study the assumptions that lead to
controlling this dependency. Based on these results, we derive a convergence
rate for the Wasserstein $1$ distance between the estimated distribution and
the target distribution which improves previous results in high dimensional
setting. This rate applies to certain classes of unbounded distributions and
particularly does not require $\log$-concavity.

### [822] [Wild Refitting for Model-Free Excess Risk Evaluation of Opaque ML/AI Models under Bregman Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02476)
*Haichen Hu,David Simchi-Levi*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new approach to evaluate the excess risk of penalized ERM with Bregman losses, leveraging the wild refitting procedure without requiring global structure knowledge of the function class.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating excess risk remains challenging for complex models such as neural networks and language models, as traditional methods rely heavily on understanding the global function class structure.

Method: The method employs randomized vector-valued symmetrization, modifies prediction residues, and retrains a second predictor using wild refitting under Bregman losses. It requires access to a single dataset and the training mechanism.

Result: The proposed framework provides high-probability performance guarantees in both fixed and random design settings, delivering effective upper bounds on excess risk.

Conclusion: The study presents a model-free, theoretically valid framework for excess risk evaluation in complex and opaque ML models, extending the scope of modern learning theory.

Abstract: We study the problem of evaluating the excess risk of classical penalized
empirical risk minimization (ERM) with Bregman losses. We show that by
leveraging the recently proposed wild refitting procedure (Wainwright, 2025),
one can efficiently upper bound the excess risk through the so-called "wild
optimism," without relying on the global structure of the underlying function
class. This property makes our approach inherently model-free. Unlike
conventional analyses, our framework operates with just one dataset and
black-box access to the training procedure. The method involves randomized
vector-valued symmetrization with an appropriate scaling of the prediction
residues and constructing artificially modified outcomes, upon which we retrain
a second predictor for excess risk estimation. We establish high-probability
performance guarantees both under the fixed design setting and the random
design setting, demonstrating that wild refitting under Bregman losses, with an
appropriately chosen wild noise scale, yields a valid upper bound on the excess
risk. This work thus is promising for theoretically evaluating modern opaque ML
and AI models such as deep neural networks and large language models, where the
model class is too complex for classical learning theory and empirical process
techniques to apply.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational challenges posed by partial identifiability and latent confounding in calculating probabilities of causation.

Method: Introduced algorithmic simplifications to reduce computational complexity and developed a methodological framework for ranking causal paths using causal metrics.

Result: Significantly tighter bounds for probabilities of causation were achieved, and a systematic approach for Root Cause Analysis was established.

Conclusion: The advancements enable more accurate and computationally efficient causal assessments, improving the analysis of causal relationships and root causes.

Abstract: Probabilities of causation provide principled ways to assess causal
relationships but face computational challenges due to partial identifiability
and latent confounding. This paper introduces both algorithmic simplifications,
significantly reducing the computational complexity of calculating tighter
bounds for these probabilities, and a novel methodological framework for Root
Cause Analysis that systematically employs these causal metrics to rank entire

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve DLP 3D printing by resolving issues like large overhangs and staircase artifacts while maintaining inherent advantages.

Method: Formulating slicing as an optimization problem where parametric curves are computed to define slicing layers, model partitioning, and motion trajectories.

Result: Optimized parametric curves successfully enable smooth, high-quality fabrication through physical experiments on a robotic multi-axis DLP printing setup.

Conclusion: This approach enhances DLP 3D printing by introducing a robust method to manufacture complex geometries while addressing key limitations of the technology.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel curve-based slicing method for generating
planar layers with dynamically varying orientations in digital light processing
(DLP) 3D printing. Our approach effectively addresses key challenges in DLP
printing, such as regions with large overhangs and staircase artifacts, while
preserving its intrinsic advantages of high resolution and fast printing
speeds. We formulate the slicing problem as an optimization task, in which
parametric curves are computed to define both the slicing layers and the model
partitioning through their tangent planes. These curves inherently define
motion trajectories for the build platform and can be optimized to meet
critical manufacturing objectives, including collision-free motion and
floating-free deposition. We validate our method through physical experiments
on a robotic multi-axis DLP printing setup, demonstrating that the optimized
curves can robustly guide smooth, high-quality fabrication of complex

*Jianzhi Long,Wenhao Sun,Rongcheng Tu,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This paper proposes LightningCP and DFA methods to accelerate talking head video generation by reducing redundancies and enhancing efficiency, while maintaining video quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Acceleration for diffusion-based talking head models is essential as they suffer from slow inference, which limits practical applications.

Method: Two key innovations: Lightning-fast Caching-based Parallel denoising (LightningCP) and Decoupled Foreground Attention (DFA). LightningCP introduces feature caching and parallel prediction, while DFA focuses on optimizing attention computations on dynamic regions and removing unnecessary features.

Result: Extensive experiments confirm significant improvements in inference speed without degrading video quality.

Conclusion: The proposed framework addresses inefficiencies in current talking head models, optimizing both speed and maintaining photorealistic video quality for practical applications.

Abstract: Diffusion-based talking head models generate high-quality, photorealistic
videos but suffer from slow inference, limiting practical applications.
Existing acceleration methods for general diffusion models fail to exploit the
temporal and spatial redundancies unique to talking head generation. In this
paper, we propose a task-specific framework addressing these inefficiencies
through two key innovations. First, we introduce Lightning-fast Caching-based
Parallel denoising prediction (LightningCP), caching static features to bypass
most model layers in inference time. We also enable parallel prediction using
cached features and estimated noisy latents as inputs, efficiently bypassing
sequential sampling. Second, we propose Decoupled Foreground Attention (DFA) to
further accelerate attention computations, exploiting the spatial decoupling in
talking head videos to restrict attention to dynamic foreground regions.
Additionally, we remove reference features in certain layers to bring extra
speedup. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly
improves inference speed while preserving video quality.

*Siyi Liu,Weiming Chen,Yushun Tang,Zhihai He*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces LatentEdit, a framework for high-quality image editing that preserves background similarity without compromising speed or memory efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of achieving high-quality image editing with fidelity and editability while maintaining computational efficiency.

Method: An adaptive latent fusion framework that dynamically combines latent codes from the source and target images without requiring model modifications or complex mechanisms.

Result: LatentEdit achieves an optimal balance between fidelity and editability, surpassing state-of-the-art methods, and features an efficient inversion-free variant for real-time deployment.

Conclusion: LatentEdit provides a lightweight and adaptable solution for fine-grained image editing, making it suitable for practical applications.

Abstract: Diffusion-based Image Editing has achieved significant success in recent
years. However, it remains challenging to achieve high-quality image editing
while maintaining the background similarity without sacrificing speed or memory
efficiency. In this work, we introduce LatentEdit, an adaptive latent fusion
framework that dynamically combines the current latent code with a reference
latent code inverted from the source image. By selectively preserving source
features in high-similarity, semantically important regions while generating
target content in other regions guided by the target prompt, LatentEdit enables
fine-grained, controllable editing. Critically, the method requires no internal
model modifications or complex attention mechanisms, offering a lightweight,
plug-and-play solution compatible with both UNet-based and DiT-based
architectures. Extensive experiments on the PIE-Bench dataset demonstrate that
our proposed LatentEdit achieves an optimal balance between fidelity and
editability, outperforming the state-of-the-art method even in 8-15 steps.
Additionally, its inversion-free variant further halves the number of neural
function evaluations and eliminates the need for storing any intermediate
variables, substantially enhancing real-time deployment efficiency.

*Maria Parelli,Michael Oechsle,Michael Niemeyer,Federico Tombari,Andreas Geiger*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for high-quality instruction-based editing of 3D assets using the latent space of native 3D diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Instruction-based editing of 3D assets has lagged due to issues with view inconsistency in existing 2D prior-based methods.

Method: The proposed method operates in the latent space of 3D diffusion models, using 3D attention map blending, geometry-aware regularization guidance, Fourier domain spectral modulation, and refinement for precise 3D editing.

Result: The method achieves superior performance in high-fidelity and robust editing of 3D shapes across a variety of shapes and semantic manipulations.

Conclusion: This approach advances the field of 3D asset editing by overcoming challenges in view inconsistency and enabling high-quality edits without the need for additional training.

Abstract: Despite the recent success of multi-view diffusion models for
text/image-based 3D asset generation, instruction-based editing of 3D assets
lacks surprisingly far behind the quality of generation models. The main reason
is that recent approaches using 2D priors suffer from view-inconsistent editing
signals. Going beyond 2D prior distillation methods and multi-view editing
strategies, we propose a training-free editing method that operates within the
latent space of a native 3D diffusion model, allowing us to directly manipulate
3D geometry. We guide the edit synthesis by blending 3D attention maps from the
generation with the source object. Coupled with geometry-aware regularization
guidance, a spectral modulation strategy in the Fourier domain and a refinement
step for 3D enhancement, our method outperforms previous 3D editing methods
enabling high-fidelity, precise, and robust edits across a wide range of shapes
and semantic manipulations.

*Xiaokang Wei,Zizheng Yan,Zhangyang Xiong,Yiming Hao,Yipeng Qin,Xiaoguang Han*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: IntrinsicReal introduces a domain adaptation framework, leveraging pseudo-labeling strategies to improve intrinsic image decomposition for real-world RGB images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current intrinsic decomposition methods rely on synthetic datasets, resulting in poor generalization to real-world RGB images.

Method: IntrinsicReal uses a dual pseudo-labeling strategy inspired by human evaluation to fine-tune a diffusion prior-based model for the real domain. It filters outputs via absolute confidence thresholds and relative preference rankings.

Result: Experimental evaluations demonstrate that IntrinsicReal surpasses existing methodologies in albedo estimation for both synthetic and real-world imagery.

Conclusion: The framework effectively bridges the domain gap, offering significant advancements in intrinsic decomposition for challenging real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Estimating albedo (a.k.a., intrinsic image decomposition) from single RGB
images captured in real-world environments (e.g., the MVImgNet dataset)
presents a significant challenge due to the absence of paired images and their
ground truth albedos. Therefore, while recent methods (e.g., IntrinsicAnything)
have achieved breakthroughs by harnessing powerful diffusion priors, they
remain predominantly trained on large-scale synthetic datasets (e.g.,
Objaverse) and applied directly to real-world RGB images, which ignores the
large domain gap between synthetic and real-world data and leads to suboptimal
generalization performance. In this work, we address this gap by proposing
IntrinsicReal, a novel domain adaptation framework that bridges the
above-mentioned domain gap for real-world intrinsic image decomposition.
Specifically, our IntrinsicReal adapts IntrinsicAnything to the real domain by
fine-tuning it using its high-quality output albedos selected by a novel dual
pseudo-labeling strategy: i) pseudo-labeling with an absolute confidence
threshold on classifier predictions, and ii) pseudo-labeling using the relative
preference ranking of classifier predictions for individual input objects. This
strategy is inspired by human evaluation, where identifying the highest-quality
outputs is straightforward, but absolute scores become less reliable for
sub-optimal cases. In these situations, relative comparisons of outputs become
more accurate. To implement this, we propose a novel two-phase pipeline that
sequentially applies these pseudo-labeling techniques to effectively adapt
IntrinsicAnything to the real domain. Experimental results show that our
IntrinsicReal significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving
state-of-the-art results for albedo estimation on both synthetic and real-world
datasets.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: RealMat, a material generator model, enhances realism in 3D material creation by leveraging a pretrained text-to-image model and a dataset of realistic material photos through fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To make 3D content authoring more accessible by addressing the realism gap in material generation created by relying on synthetic datasets.

Method: The authors developed RealMat by first fine-tuning a pre-trained Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) model with synthetic material data and then refining it with reinforcement learning using a realism reward function based on a dataset of realistic material images.

Result: RealMat achieves enhanced realism in generated materials compared to its initial version and other related methods.

Conclusion: Combining synthetic data fine-tuning with reinforcement learning and realistic priors effectively bridges the realism gap in generating 3D materials.

Abstract: Generative models for high-quality materials are particularly desirable to
make 3D content authoring more accessible. However, the majority of material
generation methods are trained on synthetic data. Synthetic data provides
precise supervision for material maps, which is convenient but also tends to
create a significant visual gap with real-world materials. Alternatively,
recent work used a small dataset of real flash photographs to guarantee
realism, however such data is limited in scale and diversity. To address these
limitations, we propose RealMat, a diffusion-based material generator that
leverages realistic priors, including a text-to-image model and a dataset of
realistic material photos under natural lighting. In RealMat, we first finetune
a pretrained Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) with synthetic material maps arranged
in $2 \times 2$ grids. This way, our model inherits some realism of SDXL while
learning the data distribution of the synthetic material grids. Still, this
creates a realism gap, with some generated materials appearing synthetic. We
propose to further finetune our model through reinforcement learning (RL),
encouraging the generation of realistic materials. We develop a realism reward
function for any material image under natural lighting, by collecting a
large-scale dataset of realistic material images. We show that this approach
increases generated materials' realism compared to our base model and related
work.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel Transformer architecture for shape analysis tasks on graphs and meshes that avoids costly eigenvalue decomposition by utilizing Hodge Laplacian operators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for shape analysis using Transformer architectures rely heavily on eigenvalue decomposition for positional embeddings, which are computationally expensive.

Method: The authors propose a new deep learning layer within the Transformer architecture that uses multi-head attention mechanisms to approximate Hodge matrices, enabling efficient learning of operators that act on mesh vertices, edges, and faces.

Result: The proposed architecture achieves computational efficiency and comparable performance in mesh segmentation and classification tasks, without requiring complex preprocessing or eigenvalue decomposition methods.

Conclusion: The paper offers a significant advancement in shape analysis by leveraging Hodge Laplacian operators, leading to a more efficient architecture while maintaining strong performance.

Abstract: Currently, prominent Transformer architectures applied on graphs and meshes
for shape analysis tasks employ traditional attention layers that heavily
utilize spectral features requiring costly eigenvalue decomposition-based
methods. To encode the mesh structure, these methods derive positional
embeddings, that heavily rely on eigenvalue decomposition based operations,
e.g. on the Laplacian matrix, or on heat-kernel signatures, which are then
concatenated to the input features. This paper proposes a novel approach
inspired by the explicit construction of the Hodge Laplacian operator in
Discrete Exterior Calculus as a product of discrete Hodge operators and
exterior derivatives, i.e. $(L := \star_0^{-1} d_0^T \star_1 d_0)$. We adjust
the Transformer architecture in a novel deep learning layer that utilizes the
multi-head attention mechanism to approximate Hodge matrices $\star_0$,
$\star_1$ and $\star_2$ and learn families of discrete operators $L$ that act
on mesh vertices, edges and faces. Our approach results in a
computationally-efficient architecture that achieves comparable performance in
mesh segmentation and classification tasks, through a direct learning
framework, while eliminating the need for costly eigenvalue decomposition
operations or complex preprocessing operations.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: GRMM introduces a full-head Gaussian 3D morphable model, offering high-detail real-time facial rendering by augmenting traditional methods with residual geometry and appearance components, bypassing limitations of previous models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3D morphable models using PCA-based methods struggle with resolution and realism, while neural volumetric approaches improve realism but are too slow for interactive applications.

Method: GRMM combines a base 3DMM with residual components for high-frequency details, employs coarse decoders for mesh deformation, fine decoders for per-Gaussian appearance, and a lightweight CNN for refining rasterized images. It utilizes the EXPRESS-50 dataset for training and disentanglement.

Result: GRMM achieves high fidelity, expression accuracy, and interactive real-time performance across 3D face reconstruction, novel view synthesis, and expression transfer tasks.

Conclusion: GRMM advances the field of 3D facial modeling by overcoming resolution and realism limitations, offering a practical real-time solution with enhanced detail and expression control.

Abstract: 3D Morphable Models (3DMMs) enable controllable facial geometry and
expression editing for reconstruction, animation, and AR/VR, but traditional
PCA-based mesh models are limited in resolution, detail, and photorealism.
Neural volumetric methods improve realism but remain too slow for interactive
use. Recent Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based facial models achieve fast,
high-quality rendering but still depend solely on a mesh-based 3DMM prior for
expression control, limiting their ability to capture fine-grained geometry,
expressions, and full-head coverage. We introduce GRMM, the first full-head
Gaussian 3D morphable model that augments a base 3DMM with residual geometry
and appearance components, additive refinements that recover high-frequency
details such as wrinkles, fine skin texture, and hairline variations. GRMM
provides disentangled control through low-dimensional, interpretable parameters
(e.g., identity shape, facial expressions) while separately modelling residuals
that capture subject- and expression-specific detail beyond the base model's
capacity. Coarse decoders produce vertex-level mesh deformations, fine decoders
represent per-Gaussian appearance, and a lightweight CNN refines rasterised
images for enhanced realism, all while maintaining 75 FPS real-time rendering.
To learn consistent, high-fidelity residuals, we present EXPRESS-50, the first
dataset with 60 aligned expressions across 50 identities, enabling robust
disentanglement of identity and expression in Gaussian-based 3DMMs. Across
monocular 3D face reconstruction, novel-view synthesis, and expression
transfer, GRMM surpasses state-of-the-art methods in fidelity and expression
accuracy while delivering interactive real-time performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fragmented and diverse nature of 3D representations by creating a framework for evaluating and comparing different methods for 3D reconstruction and generation.

Method: The authors propose a unified evaluation framework considering multiple criteria and benchmark all steps in the 3D pipeline, including preprocessing, reconstruction, compression, and generation.

Result: The framework highlights the importance of jointly evaluating generation and reconstruction due to the significant impact of reconstruction errors on overall performance.

Conclusion: The findings help guide the selection of suitable 3D models for diverse applications and improve robust and application-specific 3D generation solutions.

Abstract: Following rapid advancements in text and image generation, research has
increasingly shifted towards 3D generation. Unlike the well-established
pixel-based representation in images, 3D representations remain diverse and
fragmented, encompassing a wide variety of approaches such as voxel grids,
neural radiance fields, signed distance functions, point clouds, or octrees,
each offering distinct advantages and limitations. In this work, we present a
unified evaluation framework designed to assess the performance of 3D
representations in reconstruction and generation. We compare these
representations based on multiple criteria: quality, computational efficiency,
and generalization performance. Beyond standard model benchmarking, our
experiments aim to derive best practices over all steps involved in the 3D
generation pipeline, including preprocessing, mesh reconstruction, compression
with autoencoders, and generation. Our findings highlight that reconstruction
errors significantly impact overall performance, underscoring the need to
evaluate generation and reconstruction jointly. We provide insights that can

*Zikai Huang,Yihan Zhou,Xuemiao Xu,Cheng Xu,Xiaofen Xing,Jing Qin,Shengfeng He*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Think2Sing introduces a novel diffusion-based framework for generating expressive and realistic 3D head animations for singing, overcoming limitations in existing speech-driven approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the challenges of generating expressive, emotionally rich, and semantically coherent 3D head animations for singing, a task with uses in areas like virtual avatars and entertainment.

Method: The authors propose a framework called Think2Sing, which integrates large language models, motion subtitles derived from Singing Chain-of-Thought reasoning, and acoustic-guided retrieval for semantically coherent motion synthesis.

Result: Experimental comparisons demonstrate that Think2Sing achieves superior realism, expressiveness, and emotional fidelity in singing animations compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The study concludes that Think2Sing offers a significant advancement in singing-driven 3D animation, enabling improved expressiveness and user control, highlighting its potential applications in various domains.

Abstract: Singing-driven 3D head animation is a challenging yet promising task with
applications in virtual avatars, entertainment, and education. Unlike speech,
singing involves richer emotional nuance, dynamic prosody, and lyric-based
semantics, requiring the synthesis of fine-grained, temporally coherent facial
motion. Existing speech-driven approaches often produce oversimplified,
emotionally flat, and semantically inconsistent results, which are insufficient
for singing animation. To address this, we propose Think2Sing, a
diffusion-based framework that leverages pretrained large language models to
generate semantically coherent and temporally consistent 3D head animations,
conditioned on both lyrics and acoustics. A key innovation is the introduction
of motion subtitles, an auxiliary semantic representation derived through a
novel Singing Chain-of-Thought reasoning process combined with acoustic-guided
retrieval. These subtitles contain precise timestamps and region-specific
motion descriptions, serving as interpretable motion priors. We frame the task
as a motion intensity prediction problem, enabling finer control over facial
regions and improving the modeling of expressive motion. To support this, we
create a multimodal singing dataset with synchronized video, acoustic
descriptors, and motion subtitles, enabling diverse and expressive motion
learning. Extensive experiments show that Think2Sing outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in realism, expressiveness, and emotional fidelity,
while also offering flexible, user-controllable animation editing.

*Shuo Liu,Di Yao,Yan Lin,Gao Cong,Jingping Bi*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: The paper introduces Traj-MLLM, a general framework that applies multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to human trajectory analysis, showing improved performance without requiring additional training or fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of creating a generalized model capable of analyzing human trajectories across varying geographic regions and tasks, given the limitations of existing methods in terms of generalization.

Method: Transform raw trajectories into interleaved image-text sequences using multiview context integration to leverage MLLMs. Also, employ prompt optimization to adapt to various tasks without training or fine-tuning.

Result: Traj-MLLM achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods across four tasks, outperforming them by 48.05% in travel time estimation, 15.52% in mobility prediction, 51.52% in anomaly detection, and 1.83% in transportation mode identification.

Conclusion: Traj-MLLM demonstrates the potential of using MLLMs for general trajectory data mining, providing versatile and superior performance across multiple tasks without requiring fine-tuning, thus addressing foundational challenges in the field.

Abstract: Building a general model capable of analyzing human trajectories across
different geographic regions and different tasks becomes an emergent yet
important problem for various applications. However, existing works suffer from
the generalization problem, \ie, they are either restricted to train for
specific regions or only suitable for a few tasks. Given the recent advances of
multimodal large language models (MLLMs), we raise the question: can MLLMs
reform current trajectory data mining and solve the problem? Nevertheless, due
to the modality gap of trajectory, how to generate task-independent multimodal
trajectory representations and how to adapt flexibly to different tasks remain
the foundational challenges. In this paper, we propose \texttt{Traj-MLLM}},
which is the first general framework using MLLMs for trajectory data mining. By
integrating multiview contexts, \texttt{Traj-MLLM}} transforms raw trajectories
into interleaved image-text sequences while preserving key spatial-temporal
characteristics, and directly utilizes the reasoning ability of MLLMs for
trajectory analysis. Additionally, a prompt optimization method is proposed to
finalize data-invariant prompts for task adaptation. Extensive experiments on
four publicly available datasets show that \texttt{Traj-MLLM}} outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines by $48.05\%$, $15.52\%$, $51.52\%$, $1.83\%$ on
travel time estimation, mobility prediction, anomaly detection and
transportation mode identification, respectively. \texttt{Traj-MLLM}} achieves
these superior performances without requiring any training data or fine-tuning
the MLLM backbones.

### [835] [LLM-Guided Semantic Relational Reasoning for Multimodal Intent Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01337)
*Qianrui Zhou,Hua Xu,Yifan Wang,Xinzhi Dong,Hanlei Zhang*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: This paper introduces LGSRR, a method leveraging LLM-guided semantic reasoning to improve multimodal intent understanding, showcasing superior performance on related tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study targets the limitations of existing multimodal intent understanding methods, which struggle with fine-grained semantic relational reasoning essential for complex intent analysis.

Method: The proposed LGSRR harnesses knowledge from large language models (LLMs) to generate fine-grained semantic guidance utilized for relational reasoning. It employs a shallow-to-deep Chain-of-Thought (CoT) mechanism to rank semantic cues and formalizes relational reasoning via three logical semantic relations.

Result: LGSRR outperformed state-of-the-art methods in extensive tests on multimodal intent and dialogue act recognition tasks, demonstrating its robust capabilities in diverse real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: LGSRR improves relational reasoning for complex semantic understanding by leveraging LLMs. It performs consistently well across different datasets and can be applied broadly to enhance human intent recognition systems.

Abstract: Understanding human intents from multimodal signals is critical for analyzing
human behaviors and enhancing human-machine interactions in real-world
scenarios. However, existing methods exhibit limitations in their
modality-level reliance, constraining relational reasoning over fine-grained
semantics for complex intent understanding. This paper proposes a novel
LLM-Guided Semantic Relational Reasoning (LGSRR) method, which harnesses the
expansive knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to establish semantic
foundations that boost smaller models' relational reasoning performance.
Specifically, an LLM-based strategy is proposed to extract fine-grained
semantics as guidance for subsequent reasoning, driven by a shallow-to-deep
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) that autonomously uncovers, describes, and ranks
semantic cues by their importance without relying on manually defined priors.
Besides, we formally model three fundamental types of semantic relations
grounded in logical principles and analyze their nuanced interplay to enable
more effective relational reasoning. Extensive experiments on multimodal intent
and dialogue act recognition tasks demonstrate LGSRR's superiority over
state-of-the-art methods, with consistent performance gains across diverse
semantic understanding scenarios. The complete data and code are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding whether bacteria compete or cooperate in different environments is critical for microbial ecology. Traditional experimental methods are infeasible at large scales.

Method: Genome-scale metabolic models were used to simulate bacterial interactions across diverse environmental conditions, creating a dataset curated for various machine learning tasks.

Result: The study benchmarks recent machine learning models and confirms their effectiveness in analyzing bacterial interactions using the 'Friend or Foe' datasets.

Conclusion: Machine learning, applied to the 'Friend or Foe' compendium, can uncover mechanisms of bacterial interactions and prompt new research directions in microbial ecology.

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in microbial ecology is determining whether bacteria
compete or cooperate in different environmental conditions. With recent
advances in genome-scale metabolic models, we are now capable of simulating
interactions between thousands of pairs of bacteria in thousands of different
environmental settings at a scale infeasible experimentally. These approaches
can generate tremendous amounts of data that can be exploited by
state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to uncover the mechanisms driving
interactions. Here, we present Friend or Foe, a compendium of 64 tabular
environmental datasets, consisting of more than 26M shared environments for
more than 10K pairs of bacteria sampled from two of the largest collections of
metabolic models. The Friend or Foe datasets are curated for a wide range of
machine learning tasks -- supervised, unsupervised, and generative -- to
address specific questions underlying bacterial interactions. We benchmarked a
selection of the most recent models for each of these tasks and our results
indicate that machine learning can be successful in this application to
microbial ecology. Going beyond, analyses of the Friend or Foe compendium can
shed light on the predictability of bacterial interactions and highlight novel
research directions into how bacteria infer and navigate their relationships.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fragmented data and analytical challenges in Down syndrome research and improve translational discoveries.

Method: A knowledge graph was built using data from nine studies, integrating genetic, phenotypic, and biospecimen information while enabling AI-driven analysis and user-friendly querying methods.

Result: The knowledge graph contains over 1.6 million semantic associations, extending data coverage substantially and facilitating advanced analyses.

Conclusion: This integrative framework turns static data into a dynamic resource for discovering patterns and relationships in Down syndrome research.

Abstract: Trisomy 21 results in Down syndrome, a multifaceted genetic disorder with
diverse clinical phenotypes, including heart defects, immune dysfunction,
neurodevelopmental differences, and early-onset dementia risk. Heterogeneity
and fragmented data across studies challenge comprehensive research and
translational discovery. The NIH INCLUDE (INvestigation of Co-occurring
conditions across the Lifespan to Understand Down syndromE) initiative has
assembled harmonized participant-level datasets, yet realizing their potential
requires integrative analytical frameworks. We developed a knowledge
graph-driven platform transforming nine INCLUDE studies, comprising 7,148
participants, 456 conditions, 501 phenotypes, and over 37,000 biospecimens,
into a unified semantic infrastructure. Cross-resource enrichment with Monarch
Initiative data expands coverage to 4,281 genes and 7,077 variants. The
resulting knowledge graph contains over 1.6 million semantic associations,
enabling AI-ready analysis with graph embeddings and path-based reasoning for
hypothesis generation. Researchers can query the graph via SPARQL or natural
language interfaces. This framework converts static data repositories into
dynamic discovery environments, supporting cross-study pattern recognition,
predictive modeling, and systematic exploration of genotype-phenotype

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method combining computer-based color analysis and machine learning to accurately predict total oxidant concentration in non-thermal plasma-treated aqueous systems, overcoming limitations of traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenges of accurately measuring total oxidant concentration ([Ox]_{tot}) in NTP-treated aqueous systems, as conventional titration methods are subjective and unreliable for transient reactive oxygen and nitrogen species.

Method: The CBCA method integrates high-resolution video capture, image processing (extracting RGB, HSV, and Lab color features from KI oxidation reactions), and machine learning models (linear regression, gradient boosting) for predicting [Ox]_{tot}.

Result: The CBCA system achieved predictive accuracy (R^2 > 0.998) for [Ox]_{tot} using color features, with a reduced feature set also delivering high accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: The introduced method provides an objective, efficient, and highly accurate alternative to conventional titration for determining [Ox]_{tot} in aqueous systems.

Abstract: Accurate determination of total oxidant concentration ([Ox]_{tot}) in
non-thermal plasma (NTP)-treated aqueous systems remains a critical challenge
due to the transient nature of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and the
subjectivity of conventional titration methods used for [Ox]_{tot}
determination. This study introduces a novel, color-based computer analysis
(CBCA) method that integrates advanced image processing with machine learning
(ML) to quantify colorimetric shifts in potassium iodide (KI) solutions during
oxidation. First, a custom-built visual data acquisition system captured
high-resolution video of the color transitions in a KI solution during
oxidation with an NTP system. The change in [Ox]_{tot} during the experiments
was monitored with a standard titrimetric method. Second, the captured frames
were processed using a robust image processing pipeline to extract RGB, HSV,
and Lab color features. The extracted features were statistically evaluated,
and the results revealed strong linear correlations with the measured
[Ox]_{tot} values, particularly in the saturation (HSV), a and b (Lab), and
blue (RGB) channels. Subsequently, the [Ox]_{tot} measurements and the
extracted color features were used to train and validate five ML models. Among
them, linear regression and gradient boosting models achieved the highest
predictive accuracy (R^2 > 0.990). It was also found that reducing the feature
set from nine to four resulted in comparable performance with improved
prediction efficiency, especially for gradient boosting. Finally, comparison of
the model predictions with real titration measurements revealed that the CBCA
system successfully predicts the [Ox]_{tot} in KI solution with high accuracy
(R^2 > 0.998) even with a reduced number of features.

*Yizhe Zhang,Qiang Chen,Tao Zhou*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether general-purpose omnimodels like Gemini 2.5 Pro can compete with domain-specific models for medical image segmentation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate if omnimodels, capable of handling diverse data modalities, can achieve performance comparable to specialized models in knowledge-intensive tasks.

Method: A comparative study on the zero-shot performance of an omnimodel against domain-specific models for polyp, retinal vessel, and breast tumor segmentation with curated 'easy' and 'hard' sample subsets.

Result: Specialized models outperform omnimodels on easy cases for polyp and breast tumor segmentation, while omnimodels show better robustness on hard cases. For retinal vessel segmentation, specialist models excel consistently.

Conclusion: Omnimodels are not a universal replacement for specialists but demonstrate unique strengths that can complement domain-specific models, especially for challenging edge cases.

Abstract: The emergence of powerful, general-purpose omnimodels capable of processing
diverse data modalities has raised a critical question: can these
``jack-of-all-trades'' systems perform on par with highly specialized models in
knowledge-intensive domains? This work investigates this question within the
high-stakes field of medical image segmentation. We conduct a comparative study
analyzing the zero-shot performance of a state-of-the-art omnimodel (Gemini 2.5
Pro, the ``Nano Banana'' model) against domain-specific deep learning models on
three distinct tasks: polyp (endoscopy), retinal vessel (fundus), and breast
tumor segmentation (ultrasound). Our study focuses on performance at the
extremes by curating subsets of the ``easiest'' and ``hardest'' cases based on
the specialist models' accuracy. Our findings reveal a nuanced and
task-dependent landscape. For polyp and breast tumor segmentation, specialist
models excel on easy samples, but the omnimodel demonstrates greater robustness
on hard samples where specialists fail catastrophically. Conversely, for the
fine-grained task of retinal vessel segmentation, the specialist model
maintains superior performance across both easy and hard cases. Intriguingly,
qualitative analysis suggests omnimodels may possess higher sensitivity,
identifying subtle anatomical features missed by human annotators. Our results
indicate that while current omnimodels are not yet a universal replacement for
specialists, their unique strengths suggest a potential complementary role with
specialist models, particularly in enhancing robustness on challenging edge
cases.

Motivation: To address the challenge of accurately tracking individual lesions over time in longitudinal whole-body CT for disease monitoring and treatment response.

Method: They extended the LongiSeg framework with promptable capabilities for lesion-specific tracking via point and mask interactions, leveraging large-scale pretraining on a synthetic dataset.

Result: Pretraining on the synthetic dataset improved longitudinal context exploitation, achieving up to 6 Dice points more compared to training from scratch.

Conclusion: Incorporating longitudinal context and interactive prompting enhances lesion tracking, demonstrating the approach's robust performance. Code is made available for further exploration.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of lesions in longitudinal whole-body CT is essential
for monitoring disease progression and treatment response. While automated
methods benefit from incorporating longitudinal information, they remain
limited in their ability to consistently track individual lesions across time.
Task 2 of the autoPET/CT IV Challenge addresses this by providing lesion
localizations and baseline delineations, framing the problem as longitudinal
promptable segmentation. In this work, we extend the recently proposed LongiSeg
framework with promptable capabilities, enabling lesion-specific tracking
through point and mask interactions. To address the limited size of the
provided training set, we leverage large-scale pretraining on a synthetic
longitudinal CT dataset. Our experiments show that pretraining substantially
improves the ability to exploit longitudinal context, yielding an improvement
of up to 6 Dice points compared to models trained from scratch. These findings
demonstrate the effectiveness of combining longitudinal context with
interactive prompting for robust lesion tracking. Code is publicly available at

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers accurate, reliable, and interpretable diabetic retinopathy detection, making it suitable for clinical adoption, especially in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness worldwide,
necessitating early detection to prevent vision loss. Current automated DR
detection systems often struggle with poor-quality images, lack
interpretability, and insufficient integration of domain-specific knowledge. To
address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework that integrates three
innovative contributions: (1) Adaptive Retinal Image Enhancement Using
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs): this technique dynamically enhances
retinal images by incorporating physical constraints, improving the visibility
of critical features such as microaneurysms, hemorrhages, and exudates; (2)
Hybrid Feature Fusion Network (HFFN): by combining deep learning embeddings
with handcrafted features, HFFN leverages both learned representations and
domain-specific knowledge to enhance generalization and accuracy; (3)
Multi-Stage Classifier with Uncertainty Quantification: this method breaks down
the classification process into logical stages, providing interpretable
predictions and confidence scores, thereby improving clinical trust. The
proposed framework achieves an accuracy of 92.7%, a precision of 92.5%, a
recall of 92.6%, an F1-score of 92.5%, an AUC of 97.8%, a mAP of 0.96, and an
MCC of 0.85. Ophthalmologists rated the framework's predictions as highly
clinically relevant (4.8/5), highlighting its alignment with real-world
diagnostic needs. Qualitative analyses, including Grad-CAM visualizations and
uncertainty heatmaps, further enhance the interpretability and trustworthiness
of the system. The framework demonstrates robust performance across diverse
conditions, including low-quality images, noisy data, and unseen datasets.
These features make the proposed framework a promising tool for clinical
adoption, enabling more accurate and reliable DR detection in resource-limited
settings.

TL;DR: The study develops a deep learning model to predict 5-year breast cancer risk using digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) imaging, achieving an AUROC of 0.80.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing breast cancer screening methods for earlier detection, particularly incorporating DBT imaging due to limitations in current models.

Method: A DL-based model was built using Meta AI DINOv2 image encoder and a cumulative hazard layer to process a dataset of 161,753 DBT exams and predict cancer risk.

Result: The model demonstrated a prediction performance with an AUROC of 0.80 on the test data.

Conclusion: The approach shows promising potential for enhancing risk assessment tools and warrants further investigation for validation and improvement.

Abstract: As early detection of breast cancer strongly favors successful therapeutic
outcomes, there is major commercial interest in optimizing breast cancer
screening. However, current risk prediction models achieve modest performance
and do not incorporate digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) imaging, which was
FDA-approved for breast cancer screening in 2011. To address this unmet need,
we present a deep learning (DL)-based framework capable of forecasting an
individual patient's 5-year breast cancer risk directly from screening DBT.
Using an unparalleled dataset of 161,753 DBT examinations from 50,590 patients,
we trained a risk predictor based on features extracted using the Meta AI
DINOv2 image encoder, combined with a cumulative hazard layer, to assess a
patient's likelihood of developing breast cancer over five years. On a held-out
test set, our best-performing model achieved an AUROC of 0.80 on predictions
within 5 years. These findings reveal the high potential of DBT-based DL
approaches to complement traditional risk assessment tools, and serve as a
promising basis for additional investigation to validate and enhance our work.

Motivation: To create an accurate, interpretable tool for assisting in biopsy recommendations and malignancy predictions for breast lesions, reducing unnecessary procedures and enhancing decision-making.

Method: 1747 patients with confirmed breast lesions underwent evaluation across multiple centers. Features were extracted and integrated into logistic regression-based nomograms. Performance was compared against radiologists and ChatGPT models for prediction accuracy.

Result: The fused nomogram demonstrated the highest accuracy (83.0% for biopsy recommendations and 83.8% for malignancy prediction) among all tested models, with robust external validation.

Conclusion: The integrated BIRADS morphometric nomogram outperforms other evaluated methods, including LLMs and radiologists, providing a reliable tool to improve breast lesion diagnostics and reduce unnecessary biopsies.

Abstract: To develop and externally validate integrated ultrasound nomograms combining
BIRADS features and quantitative morphometric characteristics, and to compare
their performance with expert radiologists and state of the art large language
models in biopsy recommendation and malignancy prediction for breast lesions.
In this retrospective multicenter, multinational study, 1747 women with
pathologically confirmed breast lesions underwent ultrasound across three
centers in Iran and Turkey. A total of 10 BIRADS and 26 morphological features
were extracted from each lesion. A BIRADS, morphometric, and fused nomogram
integrating both feature sets was constructed via logistic regression. Three
radiologists (one senior, two general) and two ChatGPT variants independently
interpreted deidentified breast lesion images. Diagnostic performance for
biopsy recommendation (BIRADS 4,5) and malignancy prediction was assessed in
internal and two external validation cohorts. In pooled analysis, the fused
nomogram achieved the highest accuracy for biopsy recommendation (83.0%) and
malignancy prediction (83.8%), outperforming the morphometric nomogram, three
radiologists and both ChatGPT models. Its AUCs were 0.901 and 0.853 for the two
tasks, respectively. In addition, the performance of the BIRADS nomogram was
significantly higher than the morphometric nomogram, three radiologists and
both ChatGPT models for biopsy recommendation and malignancy prediction.
External validation confirmed the robust generalizability across different
ultrasound platforms and populations. An integrated BIRADS morphometric
nomogram consistently outperforms standalone models, LLMs, and radiologists in
guiding biopsy decisions and predicting malignancy. These interpretable,
externally validated tools have the potential to reduce unnecessary biopsies
and enhance personalized decision making in breast imaging.

Motivation: Classical transformer models are limited by quadratic complexity, large parameter counts, and high data requirements, which hinder their application to fMRI data analysis.

Method: The paper proposes a Quantum Time-series Transformer leveraging Linear Combination of Unitaries and Quantum Singular Value Transformation to achieve polylogarithmic computational complexity.

Result: Empirical evaluations show that QTT achieves comparable or superior performance to classical transformers on large fMRI datasets, with especially notable gains in small-sample cases.

Conclusion: Quantum-enhanced transformers have strong potential to efficiently model complex neural dynamics and improve clinical interpretability in computational neuroscience.

Abstract: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has emerged as a
pivotal tool for revealing intrinsic brain network connectivity and identifying

Value Transformation. Unlike classical transformers, Quantum Time-series
Transformer operates with polylogarithmic computational complexity, markedly
reducing training overhead and enabling robust performance even with fewer
parameters and limited sample sizes. Empirical evaluation on the largest-scale
fMRI datasets from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study and the UK
Biobank demonstrates that Quantum Time-series Transformer achieves comparable
or superior predictive performance compared to state-of-the-art classical
transformer models, with especially pronounced gains in small-sample scenarios.
Interpretability analyses using SHapley Additive exPlanations further reveal
that Quantum Time-series Transformer reliably identifies clinically meaningful
neural biomarkers of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). These
findings underscore the promise of quantum-enhanced transformers in advancing
computational neuroscience by more efficiently modeling complex spatio-temporal
dynamics and improving clinical interpretability.

### [846] [Temporal Representation Learning for Real-Time Ultrasound Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01433)
*Yves Stebler,Thomas M. Sutter,Ece Ozkan,Julia E. Vogt*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel deep learning approach to improve temporal representation in ultrasound videos for enhanced ejection fraction (EF) prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models fail to effectively capture the temporal dynamics essential for analyzing physiological processes in ultrasound imaging.

Method: The authors propose a temporal learning method utilizing temporally consistent masking and contrastive learning to enforce coherence across video frames.

Result: Their approach showed significant improvement in EF prediction accuracy when tested on the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset.

Conclusion: Temporal-aware representation learning is crucial for real-time ultrasound analysis, especially in applications requiring motion pattern understanding like EF prediction.

Abstract: Ultrasound (US) imaging is a critical tool in medical diagnostics, offering
real-time visualization of physiological processes. One of its major advantages
is its ability to capture temporal dynamics, which is essential for assessing
motion patterns in applications such as cardiac monitoring, fetal development,
and vascular imaging. Despite its importance, current deep learning models
often overlook the temporal continuity of ultrasound sequences, analyzing
frames independently and missing key temporal dependencies. To address this
gap, we propose a method for learning effective temporal representations from
ultrasound videos, with a focus on echocardiography-based ejection fraction
(EF) estimation. EF prediction serves as an ideal case study to demonstrate the
necessity of temporal learning, as it requires capturing the rhythmic
contraction and relaxation of the heart. Our approach leverages temporally
consistent masking and contrastive learning to enforce temporal coherence
across video frames, enhancing the model's ability to represent motion
patterns. Evaluated on the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, our method achieves a
substantial improvement in EF prediction accuracy, highlighting the importance
of temporally-aware representation learning for real-time ultrasound analysis.

### [847] [Intermittent localization and fast spatial learning by non-Markov random walks with decaying memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01806)
*Paulina R. Martí n-Cornejo,Denis Boyer*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: This paper explores how decaying memory impacts spatial learning in random walks, noting that slower decay retains learning while faster decay results in intermittent localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how memory decay affects spatial learning in models of random walks with preferential relocation, resembling human or animal movements.

Method: The study uses theoretical and numerical analyses to understand the behavior of walkers on lattices with varying memory decay rates, contrasting perfect memory, $1/\tau$ decay, and faster (exponential) forgetting.

Result: With slower decays ($\geq 1/\tau$), walkers achieve stable localization, while faster decay leads to intermittent localization. At $1/\tau$, memory efficiency enables faster learning without critical slowing down.

Conclusion: Forgetting can improve learning efficiency without compromising stability, aligning with biological evidence of the benefits of forgetting mechanisms.

Abstract: Random walks on lattices with preferential relocation to previously visited
sites provide a simple modeling of the displacements of animals and humans.
When the lattice contains a single impurity or resource site where the walker
spends more time on average at each visit than on the other sites, the long
range memory can suppress diffusion and induce by reinforcement a steady state
localized around the resource. This phenomenon can be identified with a spatial
learning process by the walker. Here we study theoretically and numerically how
the decay of memory impacts learning in these models. If memory decays as
$1/\tau$ or slower, where $\tau$ is the time backward into the past, the
localized solutions are the same as with perfect, non-decaying memory and they
are linearly stable. If forgetting is faster than $1/\tau$, for instance
exponential, an unusual regime of intermittent localization is observed, where
well localized periods of exponentially distributed duration are interspersed
with intervals of diffusive motion. At the transition between the two regimes,
for a kernel in $1/\tau$, the approach to the stable localized state is the
fastest, opposite to the expected critical slowing down effect. Hence
forgetting can allow the walker to save memory without compromising learning
and to achieve a faster learning. These findings agree with biological evidence
on the benefits of forgetting.

*Silei Song,Arash Fahim,Michael Mascagni*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Combination of neural networks and the Walk-on-Spheres (WoS) method (WoS-NN) improves stochastic elliptic PDE solving efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the need for precise, efficient, and scalable solvers for elliptic PDEs with Dirichlet boundary conditions, as existing methods often lack robustness and computational efficiency.

Method: The authors integrate neural networks with the stochastic Walk-on-Spheres (WoS) method to create a novel solver, WoS-NN, that provides instant local predictions after training, without re-sampling.

Result: The WoS-NN method achieves a 75% error reduction while requiring only 8% of the path samples of traditional WoS, significantly reducing computational costs.

Conclusion: WoS-NN combines the advantages of the WoS method and neural networks, making it a robust, meshless, and highly efficient solution for solving elliptic PDEs in static regions with high computational demand.

Abstract: Solving elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs) is a fundamental step
in various scientific and engineering studies. As a classic stochastic solver,
the Walk-on-Spheres (WoS) method is a well-established and efficient algorithm
that provides accurate local estimates for PDEs. In this paper, by integrating
machine learning techniques with WoS and space discretization approaches, we
develop a novel stochastic solver, WoS-NN. This new method solves elliptic
problems with Dirichlet boundary conditions, facilitating precise and rapid
global solutions and gradient approximations. The method inherits excellent
characteristics from the original WoS method, such as being meshless and robust
to irregular regions. By integrating neural networks, WoS-NN also gives instant
local predictions after training without re-sampling, which is especially
suitable for intense requests on a static region. A typical experimental result
demonstrates that the proposed WoS-NN method provides accurate field
estimations, reducing errors by around $75\%$ while using only $8\%$ of path
samples compared to the conventional WoS method, which saves abundant
computational time and resource consumption.

*Shuchang Liu,Paul A. O'Gorman*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: CERA is a machine learning framework designed to enhance climate-change-related generalization by using latent-space alignment and labeled control-climate data, outperforming traditional approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge is to design machine learning models that generalize robustly under climate change without heavy reliance on training data from warm climates or manual feature engineering.

Method: CERA uses an autoencoder with explicit latent-space alignment and a subsequent predictor for process estimation, leveraging labeled control-climate data and unlabeled warmer-climate inputs.

Result: CERA improves generalization to warmer climates and outperforms baselines in predicting moisture tendencies, energy tendencies, and precipitation extremes. Ablation studies confirm improved accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: The framework offers an effective, data-driven solution to manual feature engineering challenges and could benefit broader climate applications like statistical downscaling.

Abstract: Robust generalization under climate change remains a major challenge for
machine learning applications in climate science. Most existing approaches
struggle to extrapolate beyond the climate they were trained on, leading to a
strong dependence on training data from model simulations of warm climates. Use
of climate-invariant inputs improves generalization but requires challenging
manual feature engineering. Here, we present CERA (Climate-invariant Encoding
through Representation Alignment), a machine learning framework consisting of
an autoencoder with explicit latent-space alignment, followed by a predictor
for downstream process estimation. We test CERA on the problem of
parameterizing moist-physics processes. Without training on labeled data from a
+4K climate, CERA leverages labeled control-climate data and unlabeled
warmer-climate inputs to improve generalization to the warmer climate,
outperforming both raw-input and physically informed baselines in predicting
key moisture and energy tendencies. It captures not only the vertical and
meridional structures of the moisture tendencies, but also shifts in the
intensity distribution of precipitation including extremes. Ablation
experiments show that latent alignment improves both accuracy and the
robustness across random seeds used in training. While some reduced skill
remains in the boundary layer, the framework offers a data-driven alternative
to manual feature engineering of climate invariant inputs. Beyond
parameterizations used in hybrid ML-physics systems, the approach holds promise
for other climate applications such as statistical downscaling.

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: MedFormer is a deep learning model developed for medium-range ocean forecasting in the Mediterranean Sea, outperforming traditional numerical systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional numerical methods for ocean forecasting face challenges due to slower dynamics and complex boundaries; the paper explores deep learning to address these limitations.

Method: MedFormer, a U-Net architecture augmented with 3D attention mechanisms, is trained on 20 years of data, finetuned, and uses autoregressive strategies for forecasting.

Result: MedFormer consistently surpasses the Mediterranean Forecasting System (MedFS) in prediction accuracy across key 3D ocean variables based on RMSE and ACC metrics.

Conclusion: Data-driven methods like MedFormer can complement or potentially replace traditional systems, offering improved accuracy and computational efficiency for operational use.

Abstract: Accurate ocean forecasting is essential for supporting a wide range of marine
applications. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have highlighted the
potential of data-driven models to outperform traditional numerical approaches,
particularly in atmospheric weather forecasting. However, extending these
methods to ocean systems remains challenging due to their inherently slower
dynamics and complex boundary conditions. In this work, we present MedFormer, a
fully data-driven deep learning model specifically designed for medium-range
ocean forecasting in the Mediterranean Sea. MedFormer is based on a U-Net
architecture augmented with 3D attention mechanisms and operates at a high
horizontal resolution of 1/24{\deg}. The model is trained on 20 years of daily
ocean reanalysis data and fine-tuned with high-resolution operational analyses.
It generates 9-day forecasts using an autoregressive strategy. The model
leverages both historical ocean states and atmospheric forcings, making it
well-suited for operational use. We benchmark MedFormer against the
state-of-the-art Mediterranean Forecasting System (MedFS), developed at
Euro-Mediterranean Center on Climate Change (CMCC), using both analysis data
and independent observations. The forecast skills, evaluated with the Root Mean
Squared Difference and the Anomaly Correlation Coefficient, indicate that
MedFormer consistently outperforms MedFS across key 3D ocean variables. These
findings underscore the potential of data-driven approaches like MedFormer to
complement, or even surpass, traditional numerical ocean forecasting systems in
both accuracy and computational efficiency.

TL;DR: The paper develops a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based method for high-resolution weather nowcasting in Switzerland, achieving superior short-term accuracy in complex mountainous terrain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of accurate, high-resolution weather forecasting in topographically complex regions like Switzerland, where traditional methods face computational and precision difficulties.

Method: The approach combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with observational inputs, integrating surface observations and past/future NWP states into the Anemoi framework to improve both accuracy and physical realism.

Result: The GNN-based model outperforms traditional NWP (ICON) and nowcasting (INCA) baselines, particularly for lead times up to 12 hours, in variables like wind and precipitation, demonstrated through multiple verification methodologies.

Conclusion: This GNN-based nowcasting approach is effective and operationally relevant for high-resolution weather forecasting in complex mountainous regions, offering improved precision and practical utility for professional forecasters.

Abstract: Recent advances in neural weather forecasting have shown significant
potential for accurate short-term forecasts. However, adapting such gridded
approaches to smaller, topographically complex regions like Switzerland
introduces computational challenges, especially when aiming for high spatial (1
km) and temporal (10 minutes) resolution. This paper presents a Graph Neural
Network (GNN)-based approach for high-resolution nowcasting in Switzerland
using the Anemoi framework and observational inputs. The proposed model
combines surface observations with selected past and future numerical weather
prediction (NWP) states, enabling an observation-guided interpolation strategy
that enhances short-term accuracy while preserving physical consistency. We
evaluate the method on multiple surface variables and compare it against
operational high-resolution NWP (ICON) and nowcasting (INCA) baselines. The
results show that the GNN model consistently outperforms traditional approaches
in lead times up to 12 hours, especially for wind and precipitation. A
comprehensive verification procedure, including spatial skill scores,
event-based evaluation, and blind tests with professional forecasters,
demonstrates the operational relevance of the approach for mountainous domains.

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: The study evaluates several advanced AI weather models during the South Asian Monsoon and highlights limitations in accuracy, particularly for critical metrics like precipitation and cyclone trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the reliability and operational readiness of cutting-edge AI-based weather models during the challenging South Asian Monsoon season.

Method: Performance comparison of seven AI weather models on various metrics, including temperature, precipitation, cyclone trajectory, and hyperlocal extreme events, using observational data.

Result: The models perform well for large-scale dynamics but have significant errors on key Monsoon-critical metrics, particularly when compared to ground-based data, with notable differences in mesoscale energy and cyclone predictions.

Conclusion: The models are promising but not yet operationally reliable for Monsoon predictions, with ECMWF's AIFS model showing the best overall performance.

Abstract: Seven state-of-the-art AI weather models (FourCastNet, FourCastNet-SFNO,
Pangu-Weather, GraphCast, Aurora, AIFS, and GenCast) are evaluated against
observational data during the South Asian Monsoon. The models are tested on
temperature, winds, global kinetic energy spectrum, regional precipitation,
cloud cover, cyclone trajectory prediction, and hyperlocal predictions around
extreme weather events. The models forecast large-scale dynamics with
reasonable accuracy, but fall short on key metrics critical to Monsoon-time
weather prediction. The models exhibit substantially higher errors when
compared against ground-based weather station data than against reanalysis or
conventional forecasts. The AI weather prediction models show key differences
in mesoscale kinetic energy and extreme precipitation during the Monsoon, and
predict markedly different Monsoon-time cyclone trajectories over the Indian
subcontinent, raising questions about their readiness for operational
applications. Our analysis finds that ECMWF's deterministic AIFS model offers
the most reliable performance and usability, with GraphCast and GenCast being
close seconds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenge of reliably achieving genuine generalization in autoregressive PDE surrogates, essential for deriving scientific insights and robust deployment.

Method: Application of influence function formalism to study information assimilation and propagation in PDE surrogates, revealing model limitations and offering improvement insights.

Result: Identified fundamental limitations in standard models and training processes, while providing design recommendations for improved PDE surrogates.

Conclusion: The study enhances understanding of how autoregressive PDE surrogates generalize, advancing scientific discovery potential and model robustness.

Abstract: Foundation models trained as autoregressive PDE surrogates hold significant
promise for accelerating scientific discovery through their capacity to both
extrapolate beyond training regimes and efficiently adapt to downstream tasks
despite a paucity of examples for fine-tuning. However, reliably achieving
genuine generalization - a necessary capability for producing novel scientific
insights and robustly performing during deployment - remains a critical
challenge. Establishing whether or not these requirements are met demands
evaluation metrics capable of clearly distinguishing genuine model
generalization from mere memorization.
  We apply the influence function formalism to systematically characterize how
autoregressive PDE surrogates assimilate and propagate information derived from
diverse physical scenarios, revealing fundamental limitations of standard
models and training routines in addition to providing actionable insights
regarding the design of improved surrogates.

*Uwe D. Hanebeck*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: This paper presents a non-degenerate recursive particle filter using deterministic particles and homotopy continuation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classic particle filters often suffer from issues such as particle degeneration and require techniques like resampling, which increases complexity and introduces approximation errors.

Method: The authors use deterministic low-discrepancy particle sets and progressively introduce the likelihood function via homotopy continuation. They also derive a generalized Cramér distance to guide particle movement using a Newton flow.

Result: The proposed filter avoids degeneracy, is simple to implement, and does not require density estimation or resampling.

Conclusion: This approach provides an efficient and robust alternative to traditional particle filters, making it suitable for high-dimensional filtering tasks as a plugin replacement.

Abstract: We propose a recursive particle filter for high-dimensional problems that
inherently never degenerates. The state estimate is represented by
deterministic low-discrepancy particle sets. We focus on the measurement update
step, where a likelihood function is used for representing the measurement and
its uncertainty. This likelihood is progressively introduced into the filtering
procedure by homotopy continuation over an artificial time. A generalized
Cram\'er distance between particle sets is derived in closed form that is
differentiable and invariant to particle order. A Newton flow then continually
minimizes this distance over artificial time and thus smoothly moves particles
from prior to posterior density. The new filter is surprisingly simple to
implement and very efficient. It just requires a prior particle set and a
likelihood function, never estimates densities from samples, and can be used as
a plugin replacement for classic approaches.

TL;DR: This paper introduces hierarchical maximum entropy to address multilevel models, using renormalization-group procedures to derive Pareto optimal distributions and simplified computational methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hierarchical structures are common in statistical, machine learning models, and physical systems, necessitating a framework to address multilevel modeling challenges.

Method: The paper extends the Gibbs variational principle and Donsker-Varadhan entropy representation, using renormalization-group procedures and introducing parameter flows to streamline computations.

Result: Pareto optimal distributions across hierarchical levels are derived, and computational processes are simplified using parameter flows and hierarchical invariances.

Conclusion: The study bridges probability theory, information theory, and statistical mechanics, establishing a method for efficient multilevel model analysis.

Abstract: Hierarchical structures, which include multiple levels, are prevalent in
statistical and machine-learning models as well as physical systems. Extending
the foundational result that the maximum entropy distribution under mean
constraints is given by the exponential Gibbs-Boltzmann form, we introduce the
framework of "hierarchical maximum entropy" to address these multilevel models.
We demonstrate that Pareto optimal distributions, which maximize entropies
across all levels of hierarchical transformations, can be obtained via
renormalization-group procedures from theoretical physics. This is achieved by
formulating multilevel extensions of the Gibbs variational principle and the
Donsker-Varadhan variational representation of entropy. Moreover, we explore
settings with hierarchical invariances that significantly simplify the
renormalization-group procedures, enhancing computational efficiency: quadratic
modular loss functions, logarithmic loss functions, and nearest-neighbor loss
functions. This is accomplished through the introduction of the concept of
parameter flows, which serves as an analog to renormalization flows in
renormalization group theory. This work connects ideas from probability theory,
information theory, and statistical mechanics.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the Quantitative Group Testing (QGT) problem and presents an adaptive algorithm that, for the first time, beats the non-adaptive information-theoretic query bound.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unresolved open question of whether adaptive methods can practically reduce the number of queries required in QGT over non-adaptive methods.

Method: The QGT problem is reformulated into an integer-vector recovery task scaled with problem sparsity, redefined as an offline reinforcement learning (RL) task, and solved adaptively using Decision Transformers in a two-step end-to-end approach.

Result: The proposed adaptive algorithm successfully reduces the average number of queries below the non-adaptive information-theoretic bound, achieving a noteworthy improvement in QGT.

Conclusion: Adaptivity in QGT is practically advantageous, as it can significantly reduce query numbers when tackling sparse data recovery problems, resolving a longstanding theoretical gap.

Abstract: We consider the problem of quantitative group testing (QGT), where the goal
is to recover a sparse binary vector from aggregate subset-sum queries: each
query selects a subset of indices and returns the sum of those entries.
Information-theoretic results suggest that adaptivity could yield up to a
twofold reduction in the total number of required queries, yet no algorithm has
surpassed the non-adaptive bound, leaving its practical benefit an open
question. In this paper, we reduce the QGT problem to an integer-vector
recovery task whose dimension scales with the sparsity of the original problem
rather than its full ambient size. We then formulate this reduced recovery task
as an offline reinforcement learning problem and employ Decision Transformers
to solve it adaptively. By combining these two steps, we obtain an effective
end-to-end method for solving the QGT problem. Our experiments show that, for
the first time in the literature, our adaptive algorithm reduces the average
number of queries below the well-known non-adaptive information-theoretic
bound, demonstrating that adaptivity can indeed reduce the number of queries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create an interpretable and actionable score that can summarize a learner's readiness for high-stakes exams by formalizing theoretical underpinnings.

Method: The authors define axioms and theoretical properties for the ERI, including monotonicity, stability, and bounded drift. They prove the existence of an optimal linear composite and compatibility with curricula.

Result: The paper establishes the mathematical foundation for ERI but focuses on theoretical derivations without presenting empirical results.

Conclusion: The theoretical framework provides a robust foundation for constructing ERI, paving the way for future empirical validation and application.

Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for an Exam Readiness Index (ERI): a
composite, blueprint-aware score R in [0,100] that summarizes a learner's
readiness for a high-stakes exam while remaining interpretable and actionable.
The ERI aggregates six signals -- Mastery (M), Coverage (C), Retention (R),
Pace (P), Volatility (V), and Endurance (E) -- each derived from a stream of
practice and mock-test interactions. We formalize axioms for component maps and
the composite, prove monotonicity, Lipschitz stability, and bounded drift under
blueprint re-weighting, and show existence and uniqueness of the optimal linear
composite under convex design constraints. We further characterize confidence
bands via blueprint-weighted concentration and prove compatibility with
prerequisite-admissible curricula (knowledge spaces / learning spaces). The

TL;DR: This study investigates the role of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) in reducing pedestrian fatalities using crash data analysis, revealing varying effectiveness based on conditions like lighting and weather.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pedestrian fatalities are rising due to factors like distracted driving and larger vehicles, creating a need for solutions to enhance safety measures.

Method: A data-driven analysis links vehicle specifications with crash data from the FARS database to study the effectiveness of specific ADAS features in varying contexts (e.g., lighting, weather).

Result: ADAS features such as PAEB, FCW, and LDW can lower pedestrian fatalities but show reduced effectiveness in low-light and poor weather conditions.

Conclusion: The paper suggests improving sensor technology and driver education to maximize the potential of ADAS features, providing actionable insights for policymakers, planners, and manufacturers.

Abstract: Pedestrian fatalities continue to rise in the United States, driven by
factors such as human distraction, increased vehicle size, and complex traffic
environments. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) offer a promising
avenue for improving pedestrian safety by enhancing driver awareness and
vehicle responsiveness. This study conducts a comprehensive data-driven
analysis utilizing the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) to quantify
the effectiveness of specific ADAS features like Pedestrian Automatic Emergency
Braking (PAEB), Forward Collision Warning (FCW), and Lane Departure Warning
(LDW), in lowering pedestrian fatalities. By linking vehicle specifications
with crash data, we assess how ADAS performance varies under different
environmental and behavioral conditions, such as lighting, weather, and
driver/pedestrian distraction. Results indicate that while ADAS can reduce
crash severity and prevent some fatalities, its effectiveness is diminished in
low-light and adverse weather. The findings highlight the need for enhanced
sensor technologies and improved driver education. This research informs
policymakers, transportation planners, and automotive manufacturers on
optimizing ADAS deployment to improve pedestrian safety and reduce
traffic-related deaths.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the urgent need to identify unique risks posed by the rapidly advancing field of embodied AI and bridge the gap in current policy frameworks to mitigate these risks.

Method: The paper provides a taxonomy of EAI risks, analyzes policies from the US, EU, and UK to assess gaps, and concludes with specific policy recommendations to address these gaps.

Result: The analysis highlights critical deficiencies in existing frameworks for managing EAI risks and identifies key policy gaps, especially in addressing physical, economic, and social impacts.

Conclusion: There is an urgent need to adapt existing policy frameworks for industrial robots, autonomous vehicles, and other AI innovations to specifically account for EAI risks, and the proposed recommendations aim to address this gap.

Abstract: The field of embodied AI (EAI) is rapidly advancing. Unlike virtual AI, EAI
can exist in, learn from, reason about, and act in the physical world. Given
recent innovations in large language and multimodal models, along with
increasingly advanced and responsive hardware, EAI systems are rapidly growing
in capabilities and operational domains. These advances present significant
risks, including physical harm from malicious use, mass surveillance, and
economic and societal disruption. However, these risks have been severely
overlooked by policymakers. Existing policies, such as international standards
for industrial robots or statutes governing autonomous vehicles, are
insufficient to address the full range of concerns. While lawmakers are
increasingly focused on AI, there is now an urgent need to extend and adapt
existing frameworks to account for the unique risks of EAI. To help bridge this
gap, this paper makes three contributions: first, we provide a foundational
taxonomy of key physical, informational, economic, and social EAI risks.
Secondly, we analyze policies in the US, EU, and UK to identify how existing
frameworks address these risks and where these policies leave critical gaps. We
conclude by offering concrete policy recommendations to address the coming wave
of EAI innovation, including mandatory testing and certification for EAI
systems, clarified liability frameworks, and forward-looking strategies to
manage and prepare for transformative economic and societal impacts.

### [863] [Scaling Legal AI: Benchmarking Mamba and Transformers for Statutory Classification and Case Law Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00141)
*Anuraj Maurya*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper introduces Mamba, a state-space model for legal AI tasks, outperforming transformers in efficiency and scalability while maintaining competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the inefficiency and scalability challenges of transformer-based legal AI systems due to quadratic attention costs.

Method: The authors benchmark Mamba against leading transformer models using task-specific metrics and legal corpora like LexGLUE, EUR-Lex, and ILDC.

Result: Mamba processes much longer legal documents than transformers, maintaining or surpassing their retrieval and classification performance.

Conclusion: The study showcases trade-offs between state-space models and transformers, promoting Mamba as a scalable solution for legal AI applications and providing open-source tools for reproducibility.

Abstract: The rapid growth of statutory corpora and judicial decisions requires
scalable legal AI systems capable of classification and retrieval over
extremely long contexts. Transformer-based architectures (e.g., Longformer,
DeBERTa) dominate current legal NLP benchmarks but struggle with quadratic
attention costs, limiting efficiency and scalability. In this work, we present
the first comprehensive benchmarking of Mamba, a state-space model (SSM) with
linear-time selective mechanisms, against leading transformer models for
statutory classification and case law retrieval. We evaluate models on
open-source legal corpora including LexGLUE, EUR-Lex, and ILDC, covering
statutory tagging, judicial outcome prediction, and case retrieval tasks.
Metrics include accuracy, recall at k, mean reciprocal rank (MRR), and
normalized discounted cumulative gain (nDCG), alongside throughput measured in
tokens per second and maximum context length. Results show that Mamba's linear
scaling enables processing of legal documents several times longer than
transformers, while maintaining or surpassing retrieval and classification
performance. This study introduces a new legal NLP benchmark suite for
long-context modeling, along with open-source code and datasets to support
reproducibility. Our findings highlight trade-offs between state-space models
and transformers, providing guidance for deploying scalable legal AI in
statutory analysis, judicial decision support, and policy research.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This study probes how students can critically assess Generative AI (GAI) outputs within introductory Computational and Data Science courses, offering initial insights into their critical thinking abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GAI tools are increasingly utilized in education, but their impact on fostering critical thinking skills is understudied, especially regarding the analysis of potentially flawed or incorrect AI-generated outputs.

Method: Learning activities were designed requiring students to analyze, critique, and revise GAI-generated responses to test their structured critical thinking abilities.

Result: Students demonstrated initial capabilities to critically engage with and improve upon GAI content, highlighting areas for future research and development in educational practices.

Conclusion: The study underscores the potential of introducing activities that enhance critical evaluation of AI-generated content, contributing to a broader understanding of effective educational integration of GAI tools.

Abstract: Generative AI (GAI) tools have seen rapid adoption in educational settings,
yet their role in fostering critical thinking remains underexplored. While
previous studies have examined GAI as a tutor for specific lessons or as a tool
for completing assignments, few have addressed how students critically evaluate
the accuracy and appropriateness of GAI-generated responses. This pilot study
investigates students' ability to apply structured critical thinking when
assessing Generative AI outputs in introductory Computational and Data Science
courses. Given that GAI tools often produce contextually flawed or factually
incorrect answers, we designed learning activities that require students to
analyze, critique, and revise AI-generated solutions. Our findings offer
initial insights into students' ability to engage critically with GAI content
and lay the groundwork for more comprehensive studies in future semesters.

*Shaena Ulissi,Andrew Dumit,P. James Joyce,Krishna Rao,Steven Watson,Sangwon Suh*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper presents validation criteria for AI-assisted systems that calculate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, proposes a three-step framework for developing these criteria, and emphasizes system-level evaluations for credibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Organizations need robust tools to calculate their carbon footprints amidst pressure to enhance environmental accountability. Current AI-assisted systems lack consistent standards and transparency.

Method: A three-step approach: identifying needs/constraints, drafting criteria, and refining them through pilot tests. Three use cases for AI applications in GHG emissions calculation are discussed.

Result: Credible AI systems can be built and evaluated using the proposed criteria with metrics like benchmark performance, data quality, uncertainty analysis, and transparent documentation.

Conclusion: The criteria provide a scalable yet credible framework for evaluating AI-assisted tools, helping practitioners and standards bodies establish trustworthy environmental assessment systems.

Abstract: As organizations face increasing pressure to understand their corporate and
products' carbon footprints, artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted calculation
systems for footprinting are proliferating, but with widely varying levels of
rigor and transparency. Standards and guidance have not kept pace with the
technology; evaluation datasets are nascent; and statistical approaches to
uncertainty analysis are not yet practical to apply to scaled systems. We
present a set of criteria to validate AI-assisted systems that calculate
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for products and materials. We implement a
three-step approach: (1) Identification of needs and constraints, (2) Draft
criteria development and (3) Refinements through pilots. The process identifies
three use cases of AI applications: Case 1 focuses on AI-assisted mapping to
existing datasets for corporate GHG accounting and product hotspotting,
automating repetitive manual tasks while maintaining mapping quality. Case 2
addresses AI systems that generate complete product models for corporate
decision-making, which require comprehensive validation of both component tasks
and end-to-end performance. We discuss the outlook for Case 3 applications,
systems that generate standards-compliant models. We find that credible AI
systems can be built and that they should be validated using system-level
evaluations rather than line-item review, with metrics such as benchmark
performance, indications of data quality and uncertainty, and transparent
documentation. This approach may be used as a foundation for practitioners,
auditors, and standards bodies to evaluate AI-assisted environmental assessment
tools. By establishing evaluation criteria that balance scalability with
credibility requirements, our approach contributes to the field's efforts to
develop appropriate standards for AI-assisted carbon footprinting systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address ethical and trustworthiness issues in generative AI, which current evaluation methods fail to encompass comprehensively.

Method: Development of a systematic framework with human-centered evaluation dimensions and analysis of global AI ethics policies.

Result: Identified essential dimensions for AI evaluation, proposed detailed indicators, and provided comparative policy insights.

Conclusion: Offers guidelines for responsible AI advancement through a comprehensive lifecycle approach, benefiting diverse stakeholders.

Abstract: This study provides an in_depth analysis of the ethical and trustworthiness
challenges emerging alongside the rapid advancement of generative artificial
intelligence (AI) technologies and proposes a comprehensive framework for their
systematic evaluation. While generative AI, such as ChatGPT, demonstrates
remarkable innovative potential, it simultaneously raises ethical and social
concerns, including bias, harmfulness, copyright infringement, privacy
violations, and hallucination. Current AI evaluation methodologies, which
mainly focus on performance and accuracy, are insufficient to address these
multifaceted issues. Thus, this study emphasizes the need for new
human_centered criteria that also reflect social impact. To this end, it
identifies key dimensions for evaluating the ethics and trustworthiness of
generative AI_fairness, transparency, accountability, safety, privacy,
accuracy, consistency, robustness, explainability, copyright and intellectual
property protection, and source traceability and develops detailed indicators
and assessment methodologies for each. Moreover, it provides a comparative
analysis of AI ethics policies and guidelines in South Korea, the United
States, the European Union, and China, deriving key approaches and implications
from each. The proposed framework applies across the AI lifecycle and
integrates technical assessments with multidisciplinary perspectives, thereby
offering practical means to identify and manage ethical risks in real_world
contexts. Ultimately, the study establishes an academic foundation for the
responsible advancement of generative AI and delivers actionable insights for
policymakers, developers, users, and other stakeholders, supporting the
positive societal contributions of AI technologies.

TL;DR: This paper introduces an adaptive tutoring framework leveraging generative AI and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide personalized, scalable training for bridging skill gaps in the 4th Industrial Revolution (4IR) workforce.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing reliance on STEM skills like AI, robotics, and cybersecurity in the 4IR era means that older workers face growing skill gaps. There is a pressing need for re-skilling and up-skilling that is both personalized and scalable.

Method: The framework uses RAG combined with generative AI, such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, to optimize content delivery for learners. Performance is assessed based on Document Hit Rate and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), and the framework is benchmarked against human-generated training data.

Result: GPT-4 achieves the highest performance, with an 87% relevancy rate and 100% alignment between training content and learner needs. The framework is effective in producing tailored learning experiences by acting as both a topic recommender and content generator.

Conclusion: The proposed system offers a scalable and cost-effective solution for personalized learning, helping bridge gaps in workforce skills in the 4IR context. It combines AI technologies for impactful and relevant workforce training.

Abstract: The rapid digital transformation of Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR)
systems is reshaping workforce needs, widening skill gaps, especially for older
workers. With growing emphasis on STEM skills such as robotics, automation,
artificial intelligence (AI), and security, large-scale re-skilling and
up-skilling are required. Training programs must address diverse backgrounds,
learning styles, and motivations to improve persistence and success, while
ensuring rapid, cost-effective workforce development through experiential
learning. To meet these challenges, we present an adaptive tutoring framework
that combines generative AI with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to
deliver personalized training. The framework leverages document hit rate and
Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) to optimize content for each learner, and is
benchmarked against human-generated training for alignment and relevance. We
demonstrate the framework in 4IR cybersecurity learning by creating a synthetic
QA dataset emulating trainee behavior, while RAG is tuned on curated
cybersecurity materials. Evaluation compares its generated training with
manually curated queries representing realistic student interactions. Responses
are produced using large language models (LLMs) including GPT-3.5 and GPT-4,
assessed for faithfulness and content alignment. GPT-4 achieves the best
performance with 87% relevancy and 100% alignment. Results show this dual-mode
approach enables the adaptive tutor to act as both a personalized topic
recommender and content generator, offering a scalable solution for rapid,
tailored learning in 4IR education and workforce development.

TL;DR: The paper assesses inclusivity gaps in Large Language Models' accessibility advice, revealing underrepresentation in several disability categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of inclusivity in LLMs' accessibility advice, which currently underserved several disability groups.

Method: The authors develop a taxonomy-aligned benchmark to audit models across three dimensions: Question-Level Coverage, Disability-Level Coverage, and Depth.

Result: Evaluation of 17 models reveals inclusivity gaps, particularly underrepresentation in Speech, Genetic/Developmental, Sensory-Cognitive, and Mental Health disability categories.

Conclusion: The findings urge for taxonomy-aware prompting/training and evaluations to enhance inclusivity across various disability categories in LLM guidance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for accessibility
guidance, yet many disability groups remain underserved by their advice. To
address this gap, we present taxonomy aligned benchmark1 of human validated,
general purpose accessibility questions, designed to systematically audit
inclusivity across disabilities. Our benchmark evaluates models along three
dimensions: Question-Level Coverage (breadth within answers), Disability-Level
Coverage (balance across nine disability categories), and Depth (specificity of
support). Applying this framework to 17 proprietary and open-weight models
reveals persistent inclusivity gaps: Vision, Hearing, and Mobility are
frequently addressed, while Speech, Genetic/Developmental, Sensory-Cognitive,
and Mental Health remain under served. Depth is similarly concentrated in a few
categories but sparse elsewhere. These findings reveal who gets left behind in
current LLM accessibility guidance and highlight actionable levers:
taxonomy-aware prompting/training and evaluations that jointly audit breadth,
balance, and depth.

It incorporates dynamic workflows and evaluates its application in multiple educational domains.

Result: In a case study on automated math test generation, AWE-produced items were statistically comparable to real exam questions, validating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: AWE introduces significant potential to reduce teacher workload, enhance teaching quality, and drive educational innovation through advanced, dynamic agentic workflows.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Artificial
Intelligence (AI) agents, agentic workflows are showing transformative
potential in education. This study introduces the Agentic Workflow for
Education (AWE), a four-component model comprising self-reflection, tool
invocation, task planning, and multi-agent collaboration. We distinguish AWE
from traditional LLM-based linear interactions and propose a theoretical
framework grounded in the von Neumann Multi-Agent System (MAS) architecture.
Through a paradigm shift from static prompt-response systems to dynamic,
nonlinear workflows, AWE enables scalable, personalized, and collaborative task
execution. We further identify four core application domains: integrated
learning environments, personalized AI-assisted learning, simulation-based
experimentation, and data-driven decision-making. A case study on automated
math test generation shows that AWE-generated items are statistically
comparable to real exam questions, validating the model's effectiveness. AWE
offers a promising path toward reducing teacher workload, enhancing
instructional quality, and enabling broader educational innovation.

TL;DR: The study investigates journalists' views on AI's role in exacerbating disinformation, with most believing it significantly heightens risks, particularly deepfakes and inaccurate data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Examine journalists' perceptions of AI's influence on disinformation amidst the rise of generative AI in news production.

Method: A structured survey of 504 journalists in the Basque Country, conducted online and via telephone, analyzing sociodemographics and attitudes toward AI's influence on journalism.

Result: 89.88% of journalists believe AI increases disinformation risks, with higher concerns among experienced professionals. Key risks are detecting false content, deepfakes, and inaccurate data.

Conclusion: Journalists see AI as a major driver of disinformation, with interconnected risks, revealing complex concerns about its impact on the media landscape.

Abstract: This study examines journalists' perceptions of the impact of artificial
intelligence (AI) on disinformation, a growing concern in journalism due to the
rapid expansion of generative AI and its influence on news production and media
organizations. Using a quantitative approach, a structured survey was
administered to 504 journalists in the Basque Country, identified through
official media directories and with the support of the Basque Association of
Journalists. This survey, conducted online and via telephone between May and
June 2024, included questions on sociodemographic and professional variables,
as well as attitudes toward AI's impact on journalism. The results indicate
that a large majority of journalists (89.88%) believe AI will considerably or
significantly increase the risks of disinformation, and this perception is
consistent across genders and media types, but more pronounced among those with
greater professional experience. Statistical analyses reveal a significant
association between years of experience and perceived risk, and between AI use
and risk perception. The main risks identified are the difficulty in detecting
false content and deepfakes, and the risk of obtaining inaccurate or erroneous
data. Co-occurrence analysis shows that these risks are often perceived as
interconnected. These findings highlight the complex and multifaceted concerns
of journalists regarding AI's role in the information ecosystem.

TL;DR: This paper introduces MolErr2Fix, a benchmark for testing Large Language Models (LLMs) on detecting and correcting errors in molecular descriptions, highlighting their limitations in chemical accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the evaluation of LLMs' reliability in molecular sciences, addressing their issues with chemical inaccuracies and lack of error recognition/justification.

Method: The creation of MolErr2Fix, a benchmark of 1,193 annotated error instances, focusing on error detection, localization, explanation, and correction in molecular descriptions.

Result: State-of-the-art LLMs were tested on MolErr2Fix, showing significant gaps in their chemical reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: MolErr2Fix is a valuable benchmark to improve the chemical reasoning and reliability of LLMs, with publicly available data and tools to support further research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown growing potential in molecular
sciences, but they often produce chemically inaccurate descriptions and
struggle to recognize or justify potential errors. This raises important
concerns about their robustness and reliability in scientific applications. To
support more rigorous evaluation of LLMs in chemical reasoning, we present the
MolErr2Fix benchmark, designed to assess LLMs on error detection and correction
in molecular descriptions. Unlike existing benchmarks focused on
molecule-to-text generation or property prediction, MolErr2Fix emphasizes
fine-grained chemical understanding. It tasks LLMs with identifying,
localizing, explaining, and revising potential structural and semantic errors
in molecular descriptions. Specifically, MolErr2Fix consists of 1,193
fine-grained annotated error instances. Each instance contains quadruple
annotations, i.e,. (error type, span location, the explanation, and the
correction). These tasks are intended to reflect the types of reasoning and
verification required in real-world chemical communication. Evaluations of
current state-of-the-art LLMs reveal notable performance gaps, underscoring the
need for more robust chemical reasoning capabilities. MolErr2Fix provides a
focused benchmark for evaluating such capabilities and aims to support progress
toward more reliable and chemically informed language models. All annotations
and an accompanying evaluation API will be publicly released to facilitate
future research.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interpreting NMR spectra to determine molecular structures is labor-intensive, expertise-dependent, and underperforms with complex or novel compounds due to algorithmic limitations and insufficient high-quality data.

Method: The NMR-Solver incorporates large-scale spectral matching and physics-guided fragment-based optimization, leveraging relationships between molecular structures and NMR spectra.

Result: NMR-Solver demonstrates strong generalization, robustness, and applicability in both simulated benchmarks and real-world cases, showing its potential for complex molecular analysis.

Conclusion: NMR-Solver integrates computational NMR, deep learning, and chemical principles into an automated system, offering a scalable approach to molecular structure elucidation and advancing methodologies for inverse problems in molecular science.

Abstract: Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful and
widely used tools for molecular structure elucidation in organic chemistry.
However, the interpretation of NMR spectra to determine unknown molecular
structures remains a labor-intensive and expertise-dependent process,
particularly for complex or novel compounds. Although recent methods have been
proposed for molecular structure elucidation, they often underperform in
real-world applications due to inherent algorithmic limitations and limited
high-quality data. Here, we present NMR-Solver, a practical and interpretable
framework for the automated determination of small organic molecule structures
from $^1$H and $^{13}$C NMR spectra. Our method introduces an automated
framework for molecular structure elucidation, integrating large-scale spectral
matching with physics-guided fragment-based optimization that exploits
atomic-level structure-spectrum relationships in NMR. We evaluate NMR-Solver on
simulated benchmarks, curated experimental data from the literature, and
real-world experiments, demonstrating its strong generalization, robustness,
and practical utility in challenging, real-life scenarios. NMR-Solver unifies
computational NMR analysis, deep learning, and interpretable chemical reasoning
into a coherent system. By incorporating the physical principles of NMR into
molecular optimization, it enables scalable, automated, and chemically
meaningful molecular identification, establishing a generalizable paradigm for
solving inverse problems in molecular science.

TL;DR: This paper benchmarks machine-learned force fields by comparing bespoke and fine-tuned foundation models for predicting molecular dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address whether it is better to build specialist force field models from scratch or adapt and fine-tune generalist foundation models for specific systems.

Method: The study compares bespoke and fine-tuned models using the MACE architecture, evaluating predictive accuracy across equilibrium and non-equilibrium molecular tasks, while probing workflows with migration pathways.

Result: Fine-tuned models show enhanced accuracy for kinetic tasks but risk degrading representations of long-range physics, highlighting divergent encoding of system physics.

Conclusion: The study identifies fine-tuning as beneficial but with trade-offs, presenting migration-based probes as diagnostic tools and offering a guide for active learning in MLFF development.

Abstract: Machine-learned force fields (MLFFs), particularly pre-trained foundation
models, promise to bring ab initio-level accuracy to the length and time scales
of molecular dynamics. Yet this shift raises a central question: is it better
to build a specialist model from scratch or adapt a generalist foundation model
for a specific system? The trade-offs in data efficiency, predictive accuracy,
and risks of out-of-distribution (OOD) failure remain unclear. Here, we present
a benchmarking framework that contrasts bespoke (from scratch) and fine-tuned
foundation models in a test case of a technologically relevant 2D material,
Cr-intercalated Sb2Te3, using the MACE architecture. Our framework employs
migration pathways, evaluated through nudged elastic band (NEB) trajectories,
as a diagnostic probe that tests both interpolation and extrapolation. We
assess accuracy for equilibrium, kinetic (atomic migration), and mechanical
(interlayer sliding) tasks. While all models capture equilibrium structures,
predictions for non-equilibrium processes diverge. Task-specific fine-tuning
substantially improves kinetic accuracy compared with both from-scratch and
zero-shot models, but can degrade learned representations of long-range
physics. Analysis of internal representations shows that training paradigms
yield distinct, non-overlapping latent encodings of system physics. This work
offers a practical guide for MLFF development, highlights migration-based
probes as efficient diagnostics, and suggests pathways toward uncertainty-aware
active learning strategies.

Abstract: Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) algorithms are popular Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) methods to sample a target probability distribution, which arises in
many applications in machine learning. Inspired by regime-switching stochastic
differential equations in the probability literature, we propose and study
regime-switching Langevin dynamics (RS-LD) and regime-switching kinetic
Langevin dynamics (RS-KLD). Based on their discretizations, we introduce
regime-switching Langevin Monte Carlo (RS-LMC) and regime-switching kinetic
Langevin Monte Carlo (RS-KLMC) algorithms, which can also be viewed as LMC and
KLMC algorithms with random stepsizes. We also propose
frictional-regime-switching kinetic Langevin dynamics (FRS-KLD) and its
associated algorithm frictional-regime-switching kinetic Langevin Monte Carlo
(FRS-KLMC), which can also be viewed as the KLMC algorithm with random
frictional coefficients. We provide their 2-Wasserstein non-asymptotic
convergence guarantees to the target distribution, and analyze the iteration
complexities. Numerical experiments using both synthetic and real data are
provided to illustrate the efficiency of our proposed algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges faced by visually impaired individuals in navigating supermarkets and identifying products, enabling autonomy and social integration.

Method: The prototype integrates computer vision, speech recognition, text-to-speech, and indoor navigation, utilizing cameras for environmental scanning and ArUco marker detection for real-time guidance.

Result: Experiments show the system effectively guides visually impaired users, enhancing their ability to navigate and shop with greater independence.

Conclusion: The system highlights the potential of inclusive, AI-driven assistive technologies in promoting accessibility and independence for visually impaired individuals.

Abstract: Shopping plays a significant role in shaping consumer identity and social
integration. However, for individuals with visual impairments, navigating in
supermarkets and identifying products can be an overwhelming and challenging
experience. This paper presents an AI-based shopping assistant prototype
designed to enhance the autonomy and inclusivity of visually impaired
individuals in supermarket environments. The system integrates multiple
technologies, including computer vision, speech recognition, text-to-speech
synthesis, and indoor navigation, into a single, user-friendly platform. Using
cameras for ArUco marker detection and real-time environmental scanning, the
system helps users navigate the store, identify product locations, provide
real-time auditory guidance, and gain context about their surroundings. The
assistant interacts with the user through voice commands and multimodal
feedback, promoting a more dynamic and engaging shopping experience. The system
was evaluated through experiments, which demonstrated its ability to guide
users effectively and improve their shopping experience. This paper contributes
to the development of inclusive AI-driven assistive technologies aimed at
enhancing accessibility and user independence for the shopping experience.

*Vimal Mollyn,Chris Harrison*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper presents a high-accuracy on-body input system for AR/VR using an RGB camera, overcoming limitations related to lighting, skin tone, and user movement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the advantages of on-body input for AR/VR over in-air interfaces and address its prior technical limitations in practical settings.

Method: The system uses an RGB camera integrated into XR headsets to recognize bare-hand interactions with the skin, ensuring robustness in varying conditions and providing metadata like touch force and finger identification.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrates high accuracy robust against lighting, diverse skin tones, and movement (e.g., walking).

Conclusion: This method offers a practical and robust solution for enabling rich on-skin interactions in AR/VR environments, unlocking potential benefits highlighted in prior HCI research.

Abstract: In augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) experiences, a user's arms and hands
can provide a convenient and tactile surface for touch input. Prior work has
shown on-body input to have significant speed, accuracy, and ergonomic benefits
over in-air interfaces, which are common today. In this work, we demonstrate
high accuracy, bare hands (i.e., no special instrumentation of the user) skin
input using just an RGB camera, like those already integrated into all modern
XR headsets. Our results show this approach can be accurate, and robust across
diverse lighting conditions, skin tones, and body motion (e.g., input while
walking). Finally, our pipeline also provides rich input metadata including
touch force, finger identification, angle of attack, and rotation. We believe
these are the requisite technical ingredients to more fully unlock on-skin
interfaces that have been well motivated in the HCI literature but have lacked
robust and practical methods.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper introduces Chronotome, a visualization tool for understanding semantic changes in time-based data using spatial-temporal mapping techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dimensionality reduction methods struggle to capture meaningful semantic changes over time in real-world datasets.

Method: The proposed visualization combines force-based projection with streaming clustering to generate spatial-temporal maps of embeddings.

Result: Chronotome allows interactive exploration of evolving themes in both text and image datasets in real-time.

Conclusion: Chronotome provides a novel way to analyze the aesthetics and semantics of temporal datasets, addressing the gap in existing methods.

Abstract: Many real-world datasets -- from an artist's body of work to a person's
social media history -- exhibit meaningful semantic changes over time that are
difficult to capture with existing dimensionality reduction methods. To address
this gap, we introduce a visualization technique that combines force-based
projection and streaming clustering methods to build a spatial-temporal map of
embeddings. Applying this technique, we create Chronotome, a tool for
interactively exploring evolving themes in time-based data -- in real time. We
demonstrate the utility of our approach through use cases on text and image
data, showing how it offers a new lens for understanding the aesthetics and
semantics of temporal datasets.

### [879] [E-THER: A PCT-Grounded Dataset for Benchmarking Empathic AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02100)
*Sharjeel Tahir,Judith Johnson,Jumana Abu-Khalaf,Syed Afaq Ali Shah*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces E-THER, a dataset that focuses on verbal-visual emotional incongruence to enhance AI systems' ability to develop genuine empathy in therapeutic settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing empathic AI systems fail to recognize mismatches between verbal expressions and underlying emotional states due to limitations in training datasets focusing only on surface-level emotion recognition.

Method: The authors created E-THER, a humanistic multimodal dataset based on Person-Centered Therapy principles, with multidimensional annotations for verbal-visual incongruence detection. It includes behavioral engagement scores and is used to evaluate AI models.

Result: State-of-the-art VLMs trained on E-THER show improved therapeutic conversational qualities such as better engagement, minimized artificial linguistic patterns, and adherence to Person-Centered Therapy frameworks.

Conclusion: Training AI systems with datasets addressing verbal-visual incongruences can empower them to exhibit genuine empathic abilities, enhancing their role in therapeutic and conversational scenarios.

Abstract: A prevalent shortfall among current empathic AI systems is their inability to
recognize when verbal expressions may not fully reflect underlying emotional
states. This is because the existing datasets, used for the training of these
systems, focus on surface-level emotion recognition without addressing the
complex verbal-visual incongruence (mismatch) patterns useful for empathic
understanding. In this paper, we present E-THER, the first Person-Centered
Therapy-grounded multimodal dataset with multidimensional annotations for
verbal-visual incongruence detection, enabling training of AI systems that
develop genuine rather than performative empathic capabilities. The annotations
included in the dataset are drawn from humanistic approach, i.e., identifying
verbal-visual emotional misalignment in client-counsellor interactions -
forming a framework for training and evaluating AI on empathy tasks. Additional
engagement scores provide behavioral annotations for research applications.
Notable gains in empathic and therapeutic conversational qualities are observed
in state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs), such as IDEFICS and
VideoLLAVA, using evaluation metrics grounded in empathic and therapeutic
principles. Empirical findings indicate that our incongruence-trained models
outperform general-purpose models in critical traits, such as sustaining
therapeutic engagement, minimizing artificial or exaggerated linguistic
patterns, and maintaining fidelity to PCT theoretical framework.

*Akriti Verma,Shama Islam,Valeh Moghaddam,Adnan Anwar*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper proposes a graph-based framework and comment queuing mechanism to reduce online toxicity and promote emotional regulation, achieving significant improvements on platforms like Twitter and Reddit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online toxicity disrupts digital interactions, and existing solutions focus mainly on moderation after harmful interactions rather than addressing real-time emotional dynamics during online conversations.

Method: A graph-based framework was developed to assess emotional states in online conversations and regulate them in real-time. Additionally, a comment queuing mechanism introduces temporary delays for comments to allow users to self-reflect, aimed at reducing intentional trolling.

Result: The proposed graph-based framework reduced toxicity by 12%, and the comment queuing mechanism decreased the spread of anger by 15%. Only 4% of comments were temporarily delayed on average.

Conclusion: Combining real-time emotional regulation with delayed intervention can effectively mitigate online toxicity and improve emotional well-being in digital environments.

Abstract: The pervasiveness of online toxicity, including hate speech and trolling,
disrupts digital interactions and online well-being. Previous research has
mainly focused on post-hoc moderation, overlooking the real-time emotional
dynamics of online conversations and the impact of users' emotions on others.
This paper presents a graph-based framework to identify the need for emotion
regulation within online conversations. This framework promotes self-reflection
to manage emotional responses and encourage responsible behaviour in real time.
Additionally, a comment queuing mechanism is proposed to address intentional
trolls who exploit emotions to inflame conversations. This mechanism introduces
a delay in publishing comments, giving users time to self-regulate before
further engaging in the conversation and helping maintain emotional balance.
Analysis of social media data from Twitter and Reddit demonstrates that the
graph-based framework reduced toxicity by 12%, while the comment queuing
mechanism decreased the spread of anger by 15%, with only 4% of comments being
temporarily held on average. These findings indicate that combining real-time
emotion regulation with delayed moderation can significantly improve well-being
in online environments.

*Yvonne Rogers*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Examines concerns about students' over-reliance on GenAI for homework and explores designing AI tools that foster learning by requiring more effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the concern that using GenAI for homework may hinder students' development of essential skills like critical thinking and writing.

Method: Proposes designing AI tools that demand more effort from students, combining GenAI with traditional learning methods (e.g., note-taking) to enhance skill development.

Result: Early conceptual ideas for such tools and their theoretical potential to improve learning experiences and metacognition skills are discussed.

Conclusion: Effortful AI tools could help reverse the skill-stifling trend, deepen learning, and promote reflection and metacognition among students.

Abstract: Students routinely use ChatGPT and the like now to help them with their
homework, such as writing an essay. It takes less effort to complete and is
easier to do than by hand. It can even produce as good if not better output
than the student's own work. However, there is a growing concern that
over-reliance on using GenAI in this way will stifle the development of
learning writing and critical thinking skills. How might this trend be
reversed? What if students were required to make more effort when using GenAI
to do their homework? It might be more challenging, but the additional effort
involved could result in them learning more and having a greater sense of
achievement. This tension can be viewed as a form of effort paradox; where
effort is both viewed as something to be avoided but at the same time is
valued. Is it possible to let students learn sometimes with less and other
times more effort? Students are already adept at the former but what about the
latter? Could we design new kinds of AI tools that deliberately require more
effort to use to deepen the learning experience? In this paper, I begin to
outline what form these might take, for example, asking students to use a
combination of GenAI tools with traditional learning approaches (e.g.
note-taking while reading). I also discuss how else to design tools to think
with that augments human cognition; where students learn more the skills of
metacognition and reflection.

region, a collection of rural villages with deep ties to the sea, faces
existential threats from climate change that endanger its way of life. Our
project moves beyond a purely technical response, weaving together expertise
from Computer Science, Industrial Engineering, and Coastal Geography to
co-create tools with the community. By integrating generational knowledge of
residents, particularly elders, through the Eastern Shore Citizen Science
Coastal Monitoring Network, this project aims to collaborate in building a
living digital archive. This effort is hosted under Dalhousie University's
Transforming Climate Action (TCA) initiative, specifically through its
Transformative Adaptations to Social-Ecological Climate Change Trajectories
(TranSECT) and TCA Artificial Intelligence (TCA-AI) projects. This work is
driven by a collaboration model in which student teams work directly with
residents. We present a detailed project timeline and a replicable model for
how technology can support traditional communities, enabling them to navigate
climate transformation more effectively.

*Arthur Bran Herbener,Malene Flensborg Damholdt*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a theoretical framework to understand how psychotherapy by artificial agents (like chatbots) differs from therapy by human therapists and identifies challenges such as the genuineness and credibility gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing presence of AI-driven agents, particularly large language models, has prompted inquiries into their potential to effectively replace human therapists. However, the mechanisms driving change in such AI-mediated therapy remain unexplored.

Method: The authors conduct a conceptual analysis focusing on the inherent roles of human therapists, including their ontological (being human) and sociocultural (status as healthcare professionals) statuses, and how these influence therapy outcomes.

Result: The framework identifies two key gaps — the genuineness gap and credibility gap — that could affect therapeutic outcomes when performed by artificial agents, highlighting the differences between agents and human therapists.

Conclusion: While artificial agents bring potential advantages, their agentic nature presents unique challenges. The paper urges further scientific research and applications to effectively integrate the strengths of both human and artificial therapy providers.

Abstract: The question of whether artificial agents (e.g., chatbots and social robots)
can replace human therapists has received notable attention following the
recent launch of large language models. However, little is known about the
processes of change in psychotherapy delivered by artificial agents. To
facilitate hypothesis development and stimulate scientific debate, the present
article offers the first theoretical framework of the processes of change in
psychotherapy delivered by artificial agents. The theoretical framework rests
upon a conceptual analysis of what active ingredients may be inherently linked
to the presence of human therapists. We propose that human therapists'
ontological status as human beings and sociocultural status as socially
sanctioned healthcare professionals play crucial roles in promoting treatment
outcomes. In the absence of the ontological and sociocultural status of human
therapists, we propose what we coin the genuineness gap and credibility gap can
emerge and undermine key processes of change in psychotherapy. Based on these
propositions, we propose avenues for scientific investigations and practical
applications aimed at leveraging the strengths of artificial agents and human
therapists respectively. We also highlight the intricate agentic nature of
artificial agents and discuss how this complicates endeavors to establish
universally applicable propositions regarding the processes of change in these
interventions.

Motivation: Explore the implications of adopting AI in future workplace systems, focusing on technological development and stakeholder considerations.

Method: The study examines twelve application cases to investigate AI's technological areas and psychological impacts at work.

Result: Identified the importance of high-quality training data and human expertise for AI development; highlighted factors like acceptance and trust affecting AI adoption.

Conclusion: Developing AI applications for workplaces requires attention to both technical and psychological elements, emphasizing collaborative user integration.

Abstract: In this paper we present an analysis of technological and psychological
factors of applying artificial intelligence (AI) at the work place. We do so
for a number of twelve application cases in the context of a project where AI
is integrated at work places and in work systems of the future. From a
technological point of view we mainly look at the areas of AI that the
applications are concerned with. This allows to formulate recommendations in
terms of what to look at in developing an AI application and what to pay
attention to with regards to building AI literacy with different stakeholders
using the system. This includes the importance of high-quality data for
training learning-based systems as well as the integration of human expertise,
especially with knowledge-based systems. In terms of the psychological factors
we derive research questions to investigate in the development of AI supported
work systems and to consider in future work, mainly concerned with topics such
as acceptance, openness, and trust in an AI system.

*Nader Shakibay Senobari*

Main category: physics.geo-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to identify stress-sensitive precursors hidden in ambient seismic noise for earthquake prediction, validated across diverse tectonic settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the long-standing challenge of reliably predicting earthquakes, exploring whether precursors are absent in nature or simply obscured by noise.

Method: The researchers developed a stress-sensitive frequency-domain transformation to detect energy differences between adjacent frequency bands, identifying subtle spectral changes correlated with stress evolution.

Result: Their approach revealed consistent precursory signatures, arc-like trajectories, and stress accelerations occurring hours to days before major earthquakes, validated across diverse tectonic scenarios.

Conclusion: Hidden seismic precursors are indeed present in ambient noise, and the proposed method enables real-time fault monitoring and short-term earthquake forecasting.

Abstract: Earthquake prediction has long been one of the most elusive challenges in
science. Laboratory experiments and simulations suggest that failure precursors
should exist, yet reliable signals have remained unobserved in real-world
seismic records, leaving open the question of whether they are absent in nature
or simply hidden within noise. Here we introduce a stress-sensitive
frequency-domain transformation that tracks energy differences between adjacent
frequency bands, isolating subtle spectral changes linked to evolving shear and
normal stress. Applied to both laboratory acoustic emission data and seismic
records from seven major earthquakes (Mw 5.9-9.0), including the 2011 Tohoku
and 2023 Turkey-Syria events, the transform consistently reveals precursory
signatures, arc-like trajectories and accelerations toward extrema, emerging
hours to days before rupture. These features are robust across diverse tectonic
settings, from induced seismicity and volcanic collapse to continental
strike-slip and subduction megathrust earthquakes. Our findings demonstrate
that hidden precursors are indeed encoded in ambient seismic noise, offering a
pathway toward real-time fault monitoring and actionable short-term earthquake
forecasting.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework using Explainable AI (XAI) to interpret hydrologic responses at granular and watershed scales, demonstrating its value through the concept of hydrologic connectivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interpretation of deep learning in hydrology is limited despite advancements in XAI methods; the authors aim to bridge this gap to enhance process understanding.

Method: The authors utilized soil moisture data from a hydrologic model to train a LSTM network, applying XAI to evaluate the impact of various inputs on hydrologic connectivity.

Result: XAI-based classification effectively differentiated functional roles across sub-regions at the watershed scale, providing insights into hydrologic connectivity development and streamflow variation.

Conclusion: The framework enhances the ability to aggregate hydrologic responses, offering quantitative indicators for better understanding of processes like hydrologic connectivity and streamflow dynamics.

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods have been applied to
interpret deep learning model results. However, applications that integrate XAI
with established hydrologic knowledge for process understanding remain limited.
Here we present a framework that apply XAI method at point-scale to provide
granular interpretation and enable cross-scale aggregation of hydrologic
responses. Hydrologic connectivity is used as a demonstration of the value of
this approach. Soil moisture and its movement generated by physically based
hydrologic model were used to train a long short-term memory (LSTM) network,
whose impacts of inputs were evaluated by XAI methods. Our results suggest that
XAI-based classification can effectively identify the differences in the
functional roles of various sub-regions at watershed scale. The aggregated XAI
results provide an explicit and quantitative indicator of hydrologic
connectivity development, offering insights to streamflow variation. This
framework could be used to facilitate aggregation of other hydrologic responses
to advance process understandings.

TL;DR: The FBMS R package offers Bayesian model selection and averaging using advanced Monte Carlo methods, primarily via the MJMCMC and GMJMCMC algorithms for complex regression and nonlinear models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for effective Bayesian model exploration tools for addressing multi-modal posterior landscapes within Bayesian regression models and extending them to nonlinear setups.

Method: The package uses Mode Jumping MCMC (MJMCMC) to navigate multi-modal posteriors, and introduces genetically modified MJMCMC (GMJMCMC) to facilitate nonlinear feature generation.

Result: The package was demonstrated to effectively handle Bayesian generalized nonlinear models (BGNLMs) and extended to Gaussian regression and complex modeling scenarios.

Conclusion: FBMS enables efficient inferential and predictive modeling, accommodating nonlinear extensions and adaptability to varied response distributions and mixed effects.

Abstract: The FBMS R package facilitates Bayesian model selection and model averaging
in complex regression settings by employing a variety of Monte Carlo model
exploration methods. At its core, the package implements an efficient Mode
Jumping Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MJMCMC) algorithm, designed to improve mixing
in multi-modal posterior landscapes within Bayesian generalized linear models.
In addition, it provides a genetically modified MJMCMC (GMJMCMC) algorithm that
introduces nonlinear feature generation, thereby enabling the estimation of
Bayesian generalized nonlinear models (BGNLMs). Within this framework, the
algorithm maintains and updates populations of transformed features, computes
their posterior probabilities, and evaluates the posteriors of models
constructed from them. We demonstrate the effective use of FBMS for both
inferential and predictive modeling in Gaussian regression, focusing on
different instances of the BGNLM class of models. Furthermore, through a broad
set of applications, we illustrate how the methodology can be extended to
increasingly complex modeling scenarios, extending to other response
distributions and mixed effect models.

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper introduces Bayesian generalized promotion time cure models (GPTCMs) to integrate multiscale data (individual survival, multicellular composition, and single-cell omics) for cancer prognosis and cell-type-specific gene identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the lack of statistical models that can integrate multiscale data—including individual-level survival data, multicellular composition data, and cellular-level single-cell omics covariates—to improve cancer patient outcomes.

Method: The paper proposes Bayesian generalized promotion time cure models (GPTCMs) as a statistical framework for integrating multiscale data and identifying cell-type-specific genes predictive of cancer patient survival.

Result: Simulations in both low- and high-dimensional settings showed that GPTCMs effectively identify cell-type-associated factors and improve survival prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed Bayesian GPTCMs provide a novel and effective approach for integrating complex multiscale data, enabling better identification of key biological markers and enhancing cancer prognosis.

Abstract: Single-cell technologies provide an unprecedented opportunity for dissecting
the interplay between the cancer cells and the associated tumor
microenvironment, and the produced high-dimensional omics data should also
augment existing survival modeling approaches for identifying tumor cell
type-specific genes predictive of cancer patient survival. However, there is no
statistical model to integrate multiscale data including individual-level
survival data, multicellular-level cell composition data and cellular-level
single-cell omics covariates. We propose a class of Bayesian generalized
promotion time cure models (GPTCMs) for the multiscale data integration to
identify cell-type-specific genes and improve cancer prognosis. We demonstrate
with simulations in both low- and high-dimensional settings that the proposed
Bayesian GPTCMs are able to identify cell-type-associated covariates and
improve survival prediction.

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: Bandit Importance Sampling (BIS) is a novel method for efficient sampling when the target density is costly to evaluate, leveraging Gaussian process surrogates to outperform existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient sampling is crucial when evaluating the target density is computationally expensive, and existing adaptive methods are suboptimal in many challenging scenarios.

Method: BIS uses a sequential sampling strategy combining space-filling designs and multi-armed bandits, supported by Gaussian process surrogates to optimize sample selection and exploration.

Result: BIS achieves accurate approximations with fewer evaluations, demonstrating superior performance across multimodal distributions, heavy-tailed scenarios, and computationally intensive Bayesian inference.

Conclusion: The proposed BIS method provides a significant advancement in importance sampling, reducing computational costs while maintaining accuracy over diverse applications.

Abstract: We introduce bandit importance sampling (BIS), a new class of importance
sampling methods designed for settings where the target density is expensive to
evaluate. In contrast to adaptive importance sampling, which optimises a
proposal distribution, BIS directly designs the samples through a sequential
strategy that combines space-filling designs with multi-armed bandits. Our
method leverages Gaussian process surrogates to guide sample selection,
enabling efficient exploration of the parameter space with minimal target
evaluations. We establish theoretical guarantees on convergence and demonstrate
the effectiveness of the method across a broad range of sampling tasks. BIS
delivers accurate approximations with fewer target evaluations, outperforming
competing approaches across multimodal, heavy-tailed distributions, and
real-world applications to Bayesian inference of computationally expensive
models.

*David R. Burt,Renato Berlinghieri,Tamara Broderick*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method that reliably constructs confidence intervals for spatial associations of discrete responses, handling challenges like nonrandom sampling, model misspecification, and spatially varying noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for estimating associations and uncertainty intervals in spatial data often rely on unrealistic assumptions like well-specified models or i.i.d. sampling, which fail in real-world scenarios.

Method: The method develops a novel estimator with a proof of consistency, handles spatially varying noise, and uses a delta method with the Lyapunov central limit theorem to construct confidence intervals.

Result: The proposed method achieves asymptotically nominal coverage for confidence intervals in situations where traditional methods fail, particularly under model misspecification and nonrandom spatial sampling.

Conclusion: The approach reliably produces accurate confidence intervals for discrete response spatial associations compared to standard methods, which can be unreliable and yield incorrect conclusions.

Abstract: Scientists are often interested in estimating an association between a
covariate and a binary- or count-valued response. For instance, public health
officials are interested in how much disease presence (a binary response per
individual) varies as temperature or pollution (covariates) increases. Many
existing methods can be used to estimate associations, and corresponding
uncertainty intervals, but make unrealistic assumptions in the spatial domain.
For instance, they incorrectly assume models are well-specified. Or they assume
the training and target locations are i.i.d. -- whereas in practice, these
locations are often not even randomly sampled. Some recent work avoids these
assumptions but works only for continuous responses with spatially constant
noise. In the present work, we provide the first confidence intervals with
guaranteed asymptotic nominal coverage for spatial associations given discrete
responses, even under simultaneous model misspecification and nonrandom
sampling of spatial locations. To do so, we demonstrate how to handle spatially
varying noise, provide a novel proof of consistency for our proposed estimator,
and use a delta method argument with a Lyapunov central limit theorem. We show
empirically that standard approaches can produce unreliable confidence
intervals and can even get the sign of an association wrong, while our method
reliably provides correct coverage.

Method: The authors propose KG-RAG, combining Knowledge Graphs and Retrieval-Augmented Generation to transform fragmented UTGs into accessible vector databases. This includes an intent-guided LLM-driven search for generating effective navigation paths.

Result: KG-RAG outperformed previous models like AutoDroid with an 8.9% improvement in success rate (75.8%), 8.1% boost in decision accuracy (84.6%), and reduced average task completion steps. It successfully transfers to web/desktop use cases, demonstrating significant gains in performance.

Conclusion: KG-RAG enables better decision-making in GUI agents, making them more effective in mobile and cross-platform environments. It also sets new benchmarks for research and offers practical deployment through optimized task accuracy within feasible UTG extraction costs.

Abstract: Despite recent progress, Graphic User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Large
Language Models (LLMs) struggle with complex mobile tasks due to limited
app-specific knowledge. While UI Transition Graphs (UTGs) offer structured
navigation representations, they are underutilized due to poor extraction and
inefficient integration. We introduce KG-RAG, a Knowledge Graph-driven
Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework that transforms fragmented UTGs into
structured vector databases for efficient real-time retrieval. By leveraging an
intent-guided LLM search method, KG-RAG generates actionable navigation paths,
enhancing agent decision-making. Experiments across diverse mobile apps show
that KG-RAG outperforms existing methods, achieving a 75.8% success rate (8.9%
improvement over AutoDroid), 84.6% decision accuracy (8.1% improvement), and
reducing average task steps from 4.5 to 4.1. Additionally, we present
KG-Android-Bench and KG-Harmony-Bench, two benchmarks tailored to the Chinese
mobile ecosystem for future research. Finally, KG-RAG transfers to web/desktop
(+40% SR on Weibo-web; +20% on QQ Music-desktop), and a UTG cost ablation shows
accuracy saturates at ~4h per complex app, enabling practical deployment
trade-offs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ShortageSim, a novel simulation framework based on large language models (LLMs) to analyze and mitigate drug shortages by modeling strategic interactions under uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Drug shortages present significant challenges to patient care and healthcare systems, but the efficacy of regulatory interventions remains poorly understood due to information asymmetries in pharmaceutical supply chains.

Method: The authors developed ShortageSim, an LLM-based multi-agent simulation framework that models interactions between drug manufacturers, institutional buyers, and regulatory agencies. It leverages bounded-rational decision-making in sequential production games and simulates the effects of FDA announcements on supply chain decisions.

Result: The model notably reduces resolution-lag percentages for discontinued-disclosed cases by 83%, aligning simulated durations more closely with real-world data compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: ShortageSim offers a powerful computational framework for studying and improving interventions in pharmaceutical supply chains, providing valuable insights and open-source resources for future research.

Abstract: Drug shortages pose critical risks to patient care and healthcare systems
worldwide, yet the effectiveness of regulatory interventions remains poorly
understood due to fundamental information asymmetries in pharmaceutical supply
chains. We present \textbf{ShortageSim}, the first Large Language Model
(LLM)-based multi-agent simulation framework that captures the complex,
strategic interactions between drug manufacturers, institutional buyers, and
regulatory agencies in response to shortage alerts. Unlike traditional
game-theoretic models that assume perfect rationality and complete information,
\textbf{ShortageSim} leverages LLMs to simulate bounded-rational
decision-making under uncertainty. Through a sequential production game
spanning multiple quarters, we model how FDA announcements, both reactive
alerts about existing shortages and proactive warnings about potential
disruptions, propagate through the supply chain and influence capacity
investment and procurement decisions. Our experiments on historical shortage
events reveal that \textbf{ShortageSim} reduces the resolution-lag percentage
for discontinued-disclosed cases by 83\%, bringing simulated durations more
aligned to ground truth than the zero-shot baseline. We open-source
\textbf{ShortageSim} and a dataset of 2,925 FDA shortage events at
https://github.com/Lemutisme/Sortage_Management, providing a novel
computational framework for designing and testing interventions in complex,
information-scarce supply chains.

Result: MobiAgent outperforms both general-purpose language models and specialized GUI agent models in real-world mobile tasks.

Conclusion: MobiAgent significantly advances the capabilities of mobile agents by addressing challenges of accuracy, efficiency, and data annotation scalability.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), GUI-based mobile
agents have emerged as a key development direction for intelligent mobile
systems. However, existing agent models continue to face significant challenges
in real-world task execution, particularly in terms of accuracy and efficiency.
To address these limitations, we propose MobiAgent, a comprehensive mobile
agent system comprising three core components: the MobiMind-series agent
models, the AgentRR acceleration framework, and the MobiFlow benchmarking
suite. Furthermore, recognizing that the capabilities of current mobile agents
are still limited by the availability of high-quality data, we have developed
an AI-assisted agile data collection pipeline that significantly reduces the
cost of manual annotation. Compared to both general-purpose LLMs and
specialized GUI agent models, MobiAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance
in real-world mobile scenarios.

Main category: physics.plasm-ph

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of machine learning for real-time magnetic control in tokamak plasmas, measuring its accuracy and addressing challenges like current modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance real-time magnetic control in tokamak plasmas using machine learning while addressing potential inaccuracies and optimizing control methods.

Method: The study involves training neural network emulators with large datasets and evaluating their performance against Grad-Shafranov solutions, along with modeling vessel currents using regression techniques.

Result: Shape emulators achieved a 5-10% accuracy in target displacement calculation, and vessel currents could be inferred with minimal error using linear regression models.

Conclusion: Machine learning emulators with low latency show significant promise for robust real-time plasma shape control in current and future tokamak devices.

Abstract: Machine learning has recently been adopted to emulate sensitivity matrices
for real-time magnetic control of tokamak plasmas. However, these approaches
would benefit from a quantification of possible inaccuracies. We report on two
aspects of real-time applicability of emulators. First, we quantify the
agreement of target displacement from VCs computed via Jacobians of the shape
emulators with those from finite differences Jacobians on exact Grad-Shafranov
solutions. Good agreement ($\approx$5-10%) can be achieved on a selection of
geometric targets using combinations of neural network emulators with
$\approx10^5$ parameters. A sample of $\approx10^{5}-10^{6}$ synthetic
equilibria is essential to train emulators that are not over-regularised or
overfitting. Smaller models trained on the shape targets may be further
fine-tuned to better fit the Jacobians. Second, we address the effect of vessel
currents that are not directly measured in real-time and are typically subsumed
into effective "shaping currents" when designing virtual circuits. We
demonstrate that shaping currents can be inferred via simple linear regression
on a trailing window of active coil current measurements with residuals of only
a few Amp\`eres, enabling a choice for the most appropriate shaping currents at
any point in a shot. While these results are based on historic shot data and
simulations tailored to MAST-U, they indicate that emulators with
few-millisecond latency can be developed for robust real-time plasma shape
control in existing and upcoming tokamaks.

TL;DR: This paper addresses gaps in semantic interoperability for Demand Response (DR) by identifying informational requirements, evaluating existing ontologies, and proposing extensions to enhance their applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to manage decentralized systems in the future grid demands scalable, cost-effective automation enabled by semantic interoperability. However, current ontologies for Demand Response lack alignment with real-world requirements and formal validation.

Method: The authors utilize a formal ontology evaluation and development approach to identify informational requirements for incentive-based DR in commercial buildings. They evaluate three existing ontologies (Brick, DELTA, and EFOnt) against these requirements.

Result: The analysis revealed significant misalignments between practical DR requirements and existing ontologies. A roadmap of necessary ontology extensions and integrations is proposed to address these gaps.

Conclusion: The proposed roadmap aims to enhance the semantic interoperability of DR systems, supporting scalable integration into the smart grid's complex operations.

Abstract: The future grid will be highly complex and decentralized, requiring
sophisticated coordination across numerous human and software agents that
manage distributed resources such as Demand Response (DR). Realizing this
vision demands significant advances in semantic interoperability, which enables
scalable and cost-effective automation across heterogeneous systems. While
semantic technologies have progressed in commercial building and DR domains,
current ontologies have two critical limitations: they are often developed
without a formal framework that reflects real-world DR requirements, and
proposals for integrating general and application-specific ontologies remain
mostly conceptual, lacking formalization or empirical validation.
  In this paper, we address these gaps by applying a formal ontology
evaluation/development approach to define the informational requirements (IRs)
necessary for semantic interoperability in the area of incentive-based DR for
commercial buildings. We identify the IRs associated with each stage of the
wholesale incentive-based DR process, focusing on the perspective of building
owners. Using these IRs, we evaluate how well existing ontologies (Brick,
DELTA, and EFOnt) support the operational needs of DR participation. Our
findings reveal substantial misalignments between current ontologies and
practical DR requirements. Based on our assessments, we propose a roadmap of
necessary extensions and integrations for these ontologies. This work
ultimately aims to enhance the interoperability of today's and future smart
grid, thereby facilitating scalable integration of DR systems into the grid's
complex operational framework.

Motivation: Address the inequities in traditional power grids, particularly the disproportionate energy access issues for low-income communities, and facilitate equitable renewable energy transitions.

Method: Develops and applies a Markov Decision Process (MDP) model that accounts for budget constraints, energy variability, and social equity indicators to optimize renewable energy allocation across eight U.S. cities.

Result: The MDP framework achieved 32.9% renewable energy penetration and reduced underserved low-income populations by 55%, outperforming baseline policies such as random allocation and greedy methods.

Conclusion: Equity-focused renewable energy allocation is possible without major sacrifices to system performance, aligning climate goals with social equity by ensuring fair clean energy distribution.

Abstract: Traditional power grid infrastructure presents significant barriers to
renewable energy integration and perpetuates energy access inequities, with
low-income communities experiencing disproportionately longer power outages.
This study develops a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework to optimize
renewable energy allocation while explicitly addressing social equity concerns
in electricity distribution. The model incorporates budget constraints, energy
demand variability, and social vulnerability indicators across eight major U.S.
cities to evaluate policy alternatives for equitable clean energy transitions.
Numerical experiments compare the MDP-based approach against baseline policies
including random allocation, greedy renewable expansion, and expert heuristics.
Results demonstrate that equity-focused optimization can achieve 32.9%
renewable energy penetration while reducing underserved low-income populations
by 55% compared to conventional approaches. The expert policy achieved the
highest reward, while the Monte Carlo Tree Search baseline provided competitive
performance with significantly lower budget utilization, demonstrating that
fair distribution of clean energy resources is achievable without sacrificing
overall system performance and providing ways for integrating social equity
considerations with climate goals and inclusive access to clean power
infrastructure.

TL;DR: This paper bridges the gap between reduced-order models (ROMs) and full-order models (FOMs) for legged robot walking, demonstrating stable walking synthesis using a layered control method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ROM-based approaches for dynamic walking lack formal guarantees compared to FOM-based methods like hybrid zero dynamics.

Method: The authors establish conditions linking ROM dynamics to stable FOM hybrid dynamics and introduce a control design that drives the FOM to a zero dynamics manifold representing ROM behavior.

Result: A stable periodic orbit in the ROM translates to input-to-state stable periodic orbits in the FOM's hybrid zero dynamics, validated using simulations with a linear inverted pendulum ROM and a 5-link planar walking FOM.

Conclusion: The framework unifies ROM and FOM approaches for dynamic walking synthesis, offering formal guarantees for stability and performance.

Abstract: Reduced-order models (ROMs) provide a powerful means of synthesizing dynamic
walking gaits on legged robots. Yet this approach lacks the formal guarantees
enjoyed by methods that utilize the full-order model (FOM) for gait synthesis,
e.g., hybrid zero dynamics. This paper aims to unify these approaches through a
layered control perspective. In particular, we establish conditions on when a
ROM of locomotion yields stable walking on the full-order hybrid dynamics. To
achieve this result, given an ROM we synthesize a zero dynamics manifold
encoding the behavior of the ROM -- controllers can be synthesized that drive
the FOM to this surface, yielding hybrid zero dynamics. We prove that a stable
periodic orbit in the ROM implies an input-to-state stable periodic orbit of
the FOM's hybrid zero dynamics, and hence the FOM dynamics. This result is
demonstrated in simulation on a linear inverted pendulum ROM and a 5-link
planar walking FOM.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a neural controller for 6D magnetic levitation, capable of accurately mapping raw sensor data to coil commands, outperforming traditional control approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of controlling complex, unstable dynamics in magnetic levitation systems, which are pivotal for industrial automation.

Method: The authors developed and trained a neural controller end-to-end using interaction data from a proprietary controller, bypassing traditional hand-crafted control engineering.

Result: The neural controller successfully generalized to unseen scenarios, achieved robust and precise control, and demonstrated the feasibility of learning-based neural techniques in physical systems.

Conclusion: Neural control can enhance or substitute traditional engineering methods in complex applications, paving the way for broader adoption in real-world systems.

Abstract: Magnetic levitation is poised to revolutionize industrial automation by
integrating flexible in-machine product transport and seamless manipulation. It
is expected to become the standard drive for automated manufacturing. However,
controlling such systems is inherently challenging due to their complex,
unstable dynamics. Traditional control approaches, which rely on hand-crafted
control engineering, typically yield robust but conservative solutions, with
their performance closely tied to the expertise of the engineering team. In
contrast, neural control learning presents a promising alternative. This paper
presents the first neural controller for 6D magnetic levitation. Trained
end-to-end on interaction data from a proprietary controller, it directly maps
raw sensor data and 6D reference poses to coil current commands. The neural
controller can effectively generalize to previously unseen situations while
maintaining accurate and robust control. These results underscore the practical
feasibility of learning-based neural control in complex physical systems and
suggest a future where such a paradigm could enhance or even substitute
traditional engineering approaches in demanding real-world applications. The

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenges of reverse parking for vehicle-trailer systems by proposing an optimization-based path-planning and control method using nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reverse parking a vehicle with a trailer is difficult due to the system's instability and the counterintuitive controls required for proper orientation.

Method: The approach employs nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) to guide the vehicle-trailer system into a parking space. It simplifies the problem by treating the trailer as an independent vehicle for planning and tracking purposes, with kinematic relationships used for control propagation to the vehicle.

Result: Simulation and hardware-in-the-loop testing results show that the proposed method effectively guides the vehicle-trailer system into target parking spaces.

Conclusion: The proposed NMPC-based method successfully automates the challenging task of reverse parking for vehicle-trailer systems, offering robustness and simplicity in its implementation.

Abstract: Reverse parking maneuvers of a vehicle with trailer system is a challenging
task to complete for human drivers due to the unstable nature of the system and
unintuitive controls required to orientate the trailer properly. This paper
hence proposes an optimization-based automation routine to handle the
path-planning and path-tracking control process of such type of maneuvers. The
proposed approach utilizes nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) to
robustly guide the vehicle-trailer system into the desired parking space, and
an optional forward repositioning maneuver can be added as an additional stage
of the parking process to obtain better system configurations, before backward
motion can be attempted again to get a good final pose. The novelty of the
proposed approach is the simplicity of its formulation, as the path-planning
and path-tracking operations are only conducted on the trailer being viewed as
a standalone vehicle, before the control inputs are propagated to the tractor
vehicle via inverse kinematic relationships also derived in this paper.
Simulation case studies and hardware-in-the-loop tests are performed, and the
results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.

Motivation: Address the challenges of enhancing robustness in centralized multi-quadrotor transportation systems under time-varying disturbances and model uncertainties.

Method: Decompose high-dimensional error space into low-dimensional subspaces, then use multiple shallow neural networks and adaptive laws updated via online Lyapunov-based adaptation without the need for persistent excitation or offline training.

Result: Numerical simulations demonstrated enhanced robustness against time-varying disturbances and model uncertainties while maintaining Lyapunov stability.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a robust and efficient solution for real-time compensation, suitable for highly coupled and nonlinear multi-quadrotor transportation systems.

Abstract: This paper introduces an adaptive-neuro identification method that enhances
the robustness of a centralized multi-quadrotor transportation system. This
method leverages online tuning and learning on decomposed error subspaces,
enabling efficient real-time compensation to time-varying disturbances and
model uncertainties acting on the payload. The strategy is to decompose the
high-dimensional error space into a set of low-dimensional subspaces. In this
way, the identification problem for unseen features is naturally transformed
into submappings (``slices'') addressed by multiple adaptive laws and shallow
neural networks, which are updated online via Lyapunov-based adaptation without
requiring persistent excitation (PE) and offline training. Due to the
model-free nature of neural networks, this approach can be well adapted to
highly coupled and nonlinear centralized transportation systems. It serves as a
feedforward compensator for the payload controller without explicitly relying
on the dynamics coupled with the payload, such as cables and quadrotors. The
proposed control system has been proven to be stable in the sense of Lyapunov,
and its enhanced robustness under time-varying disturbances and model
uncertainties was demonstrated by numerical simulations.

Motivation: Current geometric control systems lack adequate real-time adaptivity and disturbance rejection capabilities for centralized multi-quadrotor systems.

Result: The system demonstrated robustness and stability under disturbed environments and model mismatches as validated through numerical simulations.

Conclusion: The proposed method improves both disturbance rejection and real-time adaptability without requiring pre-training or persistent excitation conditions.

Abstract: This paper introduces an adaptive-neuro geometric control for a centralized
multi-quadrotor cooperative transportation system, which enhances both
adaptivity and disturbance rejection. Our strategy is to coactively tune the
model parameters and learn the external disturbances in real-time. To realize
this, we augmented the existing geometric control with multiple neural networks
and adaptive laws, where the estimated model parameters and the weights of the
neural networks are simultaneously tuned and adjusted online. The
Lyapunov-based adaptation guarantees bounded estimation errors without
requiring either pre-training or the persistent excitation (PE) condition. The
proposed control system has been proven to be stable in the sense of Lyapunov
under certain preconditions, and its enhanced robustness under scenarios of

TL;DR: The study introduces a doubly variational quantum framework to solve the optimal power flow (OPF) problem, efficiently encoding variables via parameterized quantum circuits and utilizing classical updates for optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity and scalability issues of modern power grids necessitate innovative approaches to solve the large-scale optimization problem posed by OPF.

Method: The authors use parameterized quantum circuits (PQC) to encode primal and dual variables and express the Lagrangian function through scaled expectations of quantum observables for hybrid saddle-point optimization.

Result: Numerical tests on the IEEE 57-node power system validate the framework's ability to deliver high-quality OPF solutions efficiently.

Conclusion: The proposed quantum framework addresses challenges in OPF and has potential applications beyond it, including conic programs and quantum machine learning models.

Abstract: The optimal power flow (OPF) is a large-scale optimization problem that is
central in the operation of electric power systems. Although it can be posed as
a nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic program, the complexity of
modern-day power grids raises scalability and optimality challenges. In this
context, this work proposes a variational quantum paradigm for solving the OPF.
We encode primal variables through the state of a parameterized quantum circuit
(PQC), and dual variables through the probability mass function associated with
a second PQC. The Lagrangian function can thus be expressed as scaled
expectations of quantum observables. An OPF solution can be found by
minimizing/maximizing the Lagrangian over the parameters of the first/second
PQC. We pursue saddle points of the Lagrangian in a hybrid fashion. Gradients
of the Lagrangian are estimated using the two PQCs, while PQC parameters are
updated classically using a primal-dual method. We propose permuting primal
variables so that OPF observables are expressed in a banded form, allowing them
to be measured efficiently. Numerical tests on the IEEE 57-node power system
using Pennylane's simulator corroborate that the proposed doubly variational
quantum framework can find high-quality OPF solutions. Although showcased for
the OPF, this framework features a broader scope, including conic programs with
numerous variables and constraints, problems defined over sparse graphs, and
training quantum machine learning models to satisfy constraints.

load served, operational cost, and voltage stability, ensuring all post-defense
states satisfy network physics constraints. The methodology is first validated
on the IEEE 69-bus distribution test system with 12 DERs, 8 critical loads, and
5 tie-lines, and then extended to higher bus systems including the IEEE 123-bus
feeder and a synthetic 300-bus distribution system. Results show that the
proposed defense strategy restores nearly full service for 90% of top-ranked
attacks, mitigates voltage violations, and identifies Feeder 2 as the principal
vulnerability corridor. Actionable operating rules are derived, recommending
pre-arming of specific tie-lines to enhance resilience, while higher bus system

*Oluwatomisin I. Dada,Neil D. Lawrence*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: Recent work evaluates machine learning approaches for AC optimal power flow (AC-OPF) and introduces OPFormer-V, a transformer-based model. Findings reveal linear methods are comparable, emphasizing linear baselines' role.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reassess the performance claims of machine learning models in solving AC optimal power flow efficiently and accurately against simpler linear methods.

Method: Introduced OPFormer-V transformer-based ML model as a surrogate solver and performed systematic comparisons against DeepOPF-V and strong linear baselines.

Result: OPFormer-V surpassed DeepOPF-V but did not dramatically outperform linear baselines, which achieved comparable results.

Conclusion: The study stresses the importance of including robust linear baselines in future evaluations of ML approaches for problems like AC-OPF.

Abstract: Recent work has proposed machine learning (ML) approaches as fast surrogates
for solving AC optimal power flow (AC-OPF), with claims of significant
speed-ups and high accuracy. In this paper, we revisit these claims through a
systematic evaluation of ML models against a set of simple yet carefully
designed linear baselines. We introduce OPFormer-V, a transformer-based model
for predicting bus voltages, and compare it to both the state-of-the-art
DeepOPF-V model and simple linear methods. Our findings reveal that, while
OPFormer-V improves over DeepOPF-V, the relative gains of the ML approaches
considered are less pronounced than expected. Simple linear baselines can
achieve comparable performance. These results highlight the importance of
including strong linear baselines in future evaluations.

### [908] [RadioDiff-Loc: Diffusion Model Enhanced Scattering Congnition for NLoS Localization with Sparse Radio Map Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01875)
*Xiucheng Wang,Qiming Zhang,Nan Cheng*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper introduces a generative inference framework based on conditional diffusion models to perform accurate localization of signal sources in NLoS environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately localizing non-cooperative signal sources in NLoS environments is challenging due to multipath propagation and unknown transmit power, and is essential for applications like autonomous navigation and emergency response.

Method: A framework is proposed that uses sparse sampled RSS measurements at high-information geometric vertices, normalizes these values, trains a conditional diffusion model, and identifies the brightest point on the reconstructed power-invariant radio map for localization.

Result: The approach achieves high localization accuracy while reducing sampling cost, supported by theoretical analysis and experimental validation.

Conclusion: The framework effectively combines physical insights and data-driven methods, providing a scalable solution for NLoS emitter localization with improved accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Accurate localization of non-cooperative signal sources in non-line-of-sight
(NLoS) environments remains a critical challenge with a wide range of
applications, including autonomous navigation, industrial automation, and
emergency response. In such settings, traditional positioning techniques
relying on line-of-sight (LoS) or cooperative signaling fail due to severe
multipath propagation and unknown transmit power. This paper proposes a novel
generative inference framework for NLoS localization based on conditional
diffusion models. By leveraging the physical insight that diffracted
electromagnetic energy concentrates near building edges, we develop a sampling
strategy that collects sparse received signal strength (RSS) measurements at
the geometric vertices of obstacles--locations that maximize Fisher information
and mutual information with respect to the unknown source. To overcome the lack
of known transmission power, we normalize all sampled RSS values relative to
the maximum observed intensity, enabling the construction of a power-invariant
radio map (RM). A conditional diffusion model is trained to reconstruct the
full RM based on environmental layout and sparse RSS observations. Localization
is then achieved by identifying the brightest point on the generated RM.
Moreover, the proposed framework is compatible with existing RSS-based
localization algorithms, enabling a dual-driven paradigm that fuses physical
knowledge and data-driven inference for improved accuracy. Extensive
theoretical analysis and empirical validation demonstrate that our approach
achieves high localization accuracy with significantly reduced sampling cost,
offering a scalable and physically grounded solution for non-cooperative NLoS
emitter localization.

TL;DR: The paper introduces FSNR, a data-driven algorithm for optimal placement of PMUs to enhance deep-learning-based fault diagnosis, achieving high accuracy on IEEE systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to determine the most effective number and placement of PMUs for optimizing deep-learning fault diagnosis.

Method: The authors use the FSNR algorithm, integrating SVM ranking with neighborhood exploration for PMU selection and CNN for fault localization/classification.

Result: The proposed approach achieves over 96% location accuracy and over 99% type classification accuracy on the IEEE 34 system, and around 94% and 99.8% on the IEEE 123 system.

Conclusion: The FSNR-SVM method ensures minimal PMU configuration for robust fault diagnosis, optimizing sensor usage while maintaining high performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a data-driven Forward Selection with Neighborhood
Refinement (FSNR) algorithm to determine the number and placement of Phasor
Measurement Units (PMUs) for maximizing deep-learning-based fault diagnosis
performance. Candidate PMU locations are ranked via a cross-validated Support
Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, and each selection is refined through local
neighborhood exploration to produce a near-optimal sensor set. The resulting
PMU subset is then supplied to a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for
faulted-line localization and fault-type classification from time-series
measurements. Evaluation on modified IEEE 34- and IEEE 123-bus systems
demonstrates that the proposed FSNR-SVM method identifies a minimal PMU
configuration that achieves the best overall CNN performance, attaining over 96
percent accuracy in fault location and over 99 percent accuracy in fault-type
classification on the IEEE 34 system, and approximately 94 percent accuracy in
fault location and around 99.8 percent accuracy in fault-type classification on
the IEEE 123 system.

*Mario U. Gaimann,Miriam Klopotek*

Main category: nlin.AO

TL;DR: This study uses active matter as a substrate for reservoir computing (RC), showcasing its ability to process information through dynamical systems. Nonlinear driving forces enhance computation by activating emergent mechanisms in active matter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how biological-inspired complex systems process information and gain insights into enhancing RC using self-organizing systems.

Method: Researchers simulate active matter systems subjected to chaotic input signals, analyzing their computation capabilities when driven by varying forces.

Result: Nonlinear driving forces improve computational capacity, activating features like boundary formation, speed gradients, and regulatory mechanisms. Certain active matter phases, such as liquid droplets, excel in RC tasks.

Conclusion: Active matter systems possess robust and adaptive properties for RC, with enhanced performance driven by nonlinear forces and emergent phenomena.

Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) is a state-of-the-art machine learning method that
makes use of the power of dynamical systems (the reservoir) for real-time
inference. When using biological complex systems as reservoir substrates, it
serves as a testbed for basic questions about bio-inspired computation -- of
how self-organization generates proper spatiotemporal patterning. Here, we use
a simulation of an active matter system, driven by a chaotically moving input
signal, as a reservoir. So far, it has been unclear whether such complex
systems possess the capacity to process information efficiently and
independently of the method by which it was introduced. We find that when
switching from a repulsive to an attractive driving force, the system
completely changes the way it computes, while the predictive performance
landscapes remain nearly identical. The nonlinearity of the driver's injection
force improves computation by decoupling the single-agent dynamics from that of
the driver. Triggered are the (re-)growth, deformation, and active motion of
smooth structural boundaries (interfaces), and the emergence of coherent
gradients in speed -- features found in many soft materials and biological
systems. The nonlinear driving force activates emergent regulatory mechanisms,
which manifest enhanced morphological and dynamic diversity -- arguably
improving fading memory, nonlinearity, expressivity, and thus, performance. We
further perform RC in a broad variety of non-equilibrium active matter phases
that arise when tuning internal (repulsive) forces for information transfer.
Overall, we find that active matter agents forming liquid droplets are
particularly well suited for RC. The consistently convex shape of the
predictive performance landscapes, together with the observed phenomenological
richness, conveys robustness and adaptivity.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces Traq, an automated framework for estimating quantum speedup of classical programs with provable guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual predictions and simulations of quantum speedup are time-consuming and typically application-specific.

Method: Traq combines a classical language with quantum-amenable primitives, cost analysis to bound the resulting quantum program's complexity, and a compilation step.

Result: The framework includes a proof-of-concept implementation and a case study based on AND-OR trees.

Conclusion: Traq provides a fine-grained, automated approach to estimating quantum speedups, offering practical and provable benefits over manual methods.

Abstract: Predicting practical speedups offered by future quantum computers has become
a major focus of the quantum computing community. Typically, these predictions
are supported by lengthy manual analyses and numerical simulations and are
carried out for one specific application at a time. In this paper, we present
Traq, a principled approach towards estimating the quantum speedup of classical
programs fully automatically and with provable guarantees. It consists of a
classical language that includes high-level primitives amenable to quantum
speedups, a cost analysis, and a compilation to low-level quantum programs. Our
cost analysis upper bounds the complexity of the resulting quantum program in a
fine-grained way: it captures non-asymptotic information and is sensitive to
the input of the program (rather than providing worst-case costs). We also
provide a proof-of-concept implementation and a case study inspired by AND-OR
trees.

Abstract: Quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) promises compact function approximators
with access to vast Hilbert spaces, but its practical progress is slowed by
NISQ-era constraints such as limited qubits and noise accumulation. We
introduce a multi-chip ensemble framework using multiple small Quantum
Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs) to overcome these constraints. Our

aggregates their outputs within a Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) framework. This
modular architecture enables QRL in complex environments previously
inaccessible to quantum agents, achieving superior performance and learning
stability compared to classical baselines and single-chip quantum models. The
multi-chip ensemble demonstrates enhanced scalability by reducing information

Motivation: To address the challenge of distinguishing correlation from causation in machine intelligence and provide a physical implementation of causal inference using quantum computing.

Method: The study maps causal networks onto quantum circuits with controlled-rotation gates for probabilistic links and performs interventions by altering the circuit structure, akin to Pearl’s 'graph surgery.'

Result: The approach resolves Simpson's Paradox in a 3-qubit model, demonstrates scalability in a 10-qubit healthcare simulation, and is experimentally validated on an IonQ quantum computer under real-world noise.

Conclusion: The framework establishes a practical method for quantum causal inference, providing innovative tools to enhance algorithmic fairness and explainable AI.

Abstract: Distinguishing correlation from causation is a fundamental challenge in
machine intelligence, often representing a critical barrier to building robust
and trustworthy systems. While Pearl's $\mathcal{DO}$-calculus provides a
rigorous framework for causal inference, a parallel challenge lies in its
physical implementation. Here, we apply and experimentally validate a quantum
algorithmic framework for performing causal interventions. Our approach maps
causal networks onto quantum circuits where probabilistic links are encoded by
controlled-rotation gates, and interventions are realized by a structural
remodeling of the circuit -- a physical analogue to Pearl's ``graph surgery''.
We demonstrate the method's efficacy by resolving Simpson's Paradox in a
3-qubit model, and show its scalability by quantifying confounding bias in a
10-qubit healthcare simulation. Critically, we provide a proof-of-principle
experimental validation on an IonQ Aria quantum computer, successfully
reproducing the paradox and its resolution in the presence of real-world noise.
This work establishes a practical pathway for quantum causal inference,
offering a new computational tool to address deep-rooted challenges in

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The study benchmarks quantum machine learning (QML) approaches for detecting intrusions in UAV swarms under challenging conditions, highlighting their strengths and limitations compared to classical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UAV swarms face unique challenges such as high mobility, non-stationary traffic, and class imbalance, making intrusion detection difficult. The study seeks to explore whether QML techniques can perform better than classical baselines in such scenarios.

Method: The paper evaluates three QML models (quantum kernels, variational quantum neural networks, and hybrid quantum-trained neural networks) against classical benchmarks, using a 120 k-flow simulation. The models are assessed on identical preprocessing, balancing, and shot noise assumptions while analyzing encoding strategy, circuit depth, qubit count, and other parameters.

Result: Quantum kernels and QT-NNs showed strong performance in low-data and non-linear scenarios, while deeper QNNs faced trainability issues. Classical CNNs performed better when abundant data was available. Trade-offs were highlighted among different methods.

Conclusion: The study underscores the potential of QML in specific scenarios like low-data regimes but emphasizes that classical models still dominate in high-data environments. The public release of the dataset facilitates further research in this field.

Abstract: Intrusion detection in unmanned-aerial-vehicle (UAV) swarms is complicated by
high mobility, non-stationary traffic, and severe class imbalance. Leveraging a
120 k-flow simulation corpus that covers five attack types, we benchmark three
quantum-machine-learning (QML) approaches - quantum kernels, variational
quantum neural networks (QNNs), and hybrid quantum-trained neural networks
(QT-NNs) - against strong classical baselines. All models consume an 8-feature
flow representation and are evaluated under identical preprocessing, balancing,
and noise-model assumptions. We analyse the influence of encoding strategy,
circuit depth, qubit count, and shot noise, reporting accuracy, macro-F1,
ROC-AUC, Matthews correlation, and quantum-resource footprints. Results reveal
clear trade-offs: quantum kernels and QT-NNs excel in low-data, nonlinear
regimes, while deeper QNNs suffer from trainability issues, and CNNs dominate
when abundant data offset their larger parameter count. The complete codebase
and dataset partitions are publicly released to enable reproducible QML

Motivation: To address challenges posed by the chaotic nature of atmospheric behavior in weather forecasting, leveraging quantum computing techniques for enhanced predictive capability.

Method: The study implemented a Quantum Neural Network (QNN) and trained it using real meteorological data from NASA's POWER database, comparing its performance with a classical Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).

Result: Findings show that QNN outperformed RNN in accuracy and adaptability, particularly in predicting wind speed, and demonstrated robustness in temperature forecasting with faster convergence.

Conclusion: Quantum models like QNN hold potential for improved accuracy and robustness in short to medium-term climate prediction, but demand further optimization and study of architectural sensitivities for broader applications.

Abstract: Weather forecasting plays a crucial role in supporting strategic decisions
across various sectors, including agriculture, renewable energy production, and
disaster management. However, the inherently dynamic and chaotic behavior of
the atmosphere presents significant challenges to conventional predictive

Conclusion: The proposed approach demonstrates quantum annealers' potential as a scalable alternative to classical optimizers, enabling advancements in hybrid quantum optimization models for near-term quantum computing.

Abstract: Quantum annealers provide an effective framework for solving large-scale

training Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) by reformulating the parameter
optimization task as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO)

leverages the Hamiltonian of the chosen VQA ansatz and employs an adaptive,
metaheuristic optimization scheme. This optimization strategy provides a rich
set of configurable parameters which enables the adaptation to specific problem
characteristics and available computational resources. The proposed framework
is generalizable to arbitrary Hamiltonians and integrates a recursive
refinement strategy to progressively approximate high-quality solutions.
  Experimental evaluations demonstrate the feasibility of the method and its
ability to significantly reduce computational overhead compared to classical

TL;DR: Artificial neural networks function as adaptive systems using critical neuron coupling, leading to mechanisms shared with biological neural circuits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the training mechanisms of artificial neural networks and their parallels with biological cognition.

Method: Characterized neuron coupling, analyzed phase transitions during training, and examined loss landscapes.

Result: Identified Hebbian-like correlation graphs and transitions influencing generalization and predictive learning rules.

Conclusion: Training mechanisms in artificial neural networks share universal principles with biological neural computation.

Abstract: Deep artificial neural networks have surpassed human-level performance across
a diverse array of complex learning tasks, establishing themselves as
indispensable tools in both social applications and scientific research.
  Despite these advances, the underlying mechanisms of training in artificial
neural networks remain elusive.
  Here, we propose that artificial neural networks function as adaptive,
self-organizing information processing systems in which training is mediated by
the coherent coupling of strongly activated, task-specific critical neurons.
  We demonstrate that such neuronal coupling gives rise to Hebbian-like neural
correlation graphs, which undergo a dynamic, second-order connectivity phase
transition during the initial stages of training.
  Concurrently, the connection weights among critical neurons are consistently
reinforced while being simultaneously redistributed in a stochastic manner.
  As a result, a precise balance of neuronal contributions is established,
inducing a local concentration within the random loss landscape which provides
theoretical explanation for generalization capacity.
  We further identify a later on convergence phase transition characterized by
a phase boundary in hyperparameter space, driven by the nonequilibrium
probability flux through weight space.
  The critical computational graphs resulting from coherent coupling also
decode the predictive rules learned by artificial neural networks, drawing
analogies to avalanche-like dynamics observed in biological neural circuits.
  Our findings suggest that the coherent coupling of critical neurons and the
ensuing local concentration within the loss landscapes may represent universal
learning mechanisms shared by both artificial and biological neural
computation.

Motivation: The work is motivated by the unsustainability of artificial neural network software running on traditional transistor-based hardware and explores physical systems for computational intelligence.

Method: It emphasizes physical networks made of resistive memory nanoscale components that organize themselves dynamically. Theoretical frameworks such as mean-field theory, graph theory, and concepts from disordered systems are used to analyze their dynamics.

Result: Experimental and theoretical studies show that SOMNs exhibit criticality and phase transitions in their conductance states, demonstrating adaptability and potential for learning.

Conclusion: SOMNs offer intriguing potential for energy-efficient, brain-inspired learning systems, opening pathways for real-time decision-making and innovative technologies in resource-constrained environments like edge intelligence.

Abstract: Learning with physical systems is an emerging paradigm that seeks to harness
the intrinsic nonlinear dynamics of physical substrates for learning. The
impetus for a paradigm shift in how hardware is used for computational
intelligence stems largely from the unsustainability of artificial neural
network software implemented on conventional transistor-based hardware. This
Perspective highlights one promising approach using physical networks comprised
of resistive memory nanoscale components with dynamically reconfigurable,
self-organising electrical circuitry. Experimental advances have revealed the
non-trivial interactions within these Self-Organising Memristive Networks
(SOMNs), offering insights into their collective nonlinear and adaptive
dynamics, and how these properties can be harnessed for learning using
different hardware implementations. Theoretical approaches, including
mean-field theory, graph theory, and concepts from disordered systems, reveal
deeper insights into the dynamics of SOMNs, especially during transitions
between different conductance states where criticality and other dynamical
phase transitions emerge in both experiments and models. Furthermore, parallels
between adaptive dynamics in SOMNs and plasticity in biological neuronal
networks suggest the potential for realising energy-efficient, brain-like
continual learning. SOMNs thus offer a promising route toward embedded edge
intelligence, unlocking real-time decision-making for autonomous systems,
dynamic sensing, and personalised healthcare, by enabling embedded learning in
resource-constrained environments. The overarching aim of this Perspective is
to show how the convergence of nanotechnology, statistical physics, complex

TL;DR: This paper explores intuition for optimal hyperparameter tuning in neural networks by analyzing dynamics in phase diagrams derived from disordered systems theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperparameter tuning is critical for achieving convergence in machine learning models. Understanding the connection between neural network training dynamics and disordered system physics can provide insights into better hyperparameter choices.

Method: The authors employ a phase diagram approach tied to the dynamics of singular values of neural network weight matrices. Using a Langevin equation derived via Dyson Brownian motion, they classify three distinct training regimes based on these dynamics.

Result: Three distinct dynamical regimes during training are identified, offering a way to connect hyperparameter selection with observable weight matrix behavior.

Conclusion: This framework offers practical guidance for hyperparameter tuning by interpreting neural network training as phase transitions in disordered systems.

Abstract: Hyperparameter tuning is one of the essential steps to guarantee the
convergence of machine learning models. We argue that intuition about the
optimal choice of hyperparameters for stochastic gradient descent can be
obtained by studying a neural network's phase diagram, in which each phase is
characterised by distinctive dynamics of the singular values of weight
matrices. Taking inspiration from disordered systems, we start from the
observation that the loss landscape of a multilayer neural network with mean
squared error can be interpreted as a disordered system in feature space, where
the learnt features are mapped to soft spin degrees of freedom, the initial
variance of the weight matrices is interpreted as the strength of the disorder,
and temperature is given by the ratio of the learning rate and the batch size.
As the model is trained, three phases can be identified, in which the dynamics
of weight matrices is qualitatively different. Employing a Langevin equation
for stochastic gradient descent, previously derived using Dyson Brownian
motion, we demonstrate that the three dynamical regimes can be classified
effectively, providing practical guidance for the choice of hyperparameters of
the optimiser.

TL;DR: The paper explores the balance and interaction between explainability and privacy in multi-agent systems using epistemic temporal logic, introducing a model-checking algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the challenge of exposing information for explainability in systems while safeguarding privacy, as both depend on understanding knowledge flow.

Method: The authors use epistemic temporal logic with counterfactual reasoning to specify system-level requirements for explainability and check these with a model-checking algorithm.

Result: A prototype algorithm was developed and validated on benchmarks, demonstrating its ability to differentiate explainable systems from unexplainable ones and to include privacy constraints.

Conclusion: The work advances formal methods for combining explainability and privacy, offering tools for designing systems that meet these requirements simultaneously.

Abstract: Explainable systems expose information about why certain observed effects are
happening to the agents interacting with them. We argue that this constitutes a
positive flow of information that needs to be specified, verified, and balanced
against negative information flow that may, e.g., violate privacy guarantees.
Since both explainability and privacy require reasoning about knowledge, we
tackle these tasks with epistemic temporal logic extended with quantification
over counterfactual causes. This allows us to specify that a multi-agent system
exposes enough information such that agents acquire knowledge on why some
effect occurred. We show how this principle can be used to specify
explainability as a system-level requirement and provide an algorithm for
checking finite-state models against such specifications. We present a
prototype implementation of the algorithm and evaluate it on several
benchmarks, illustrating how our approach distinguishes between explainable and
unexplainable systems, and how it allows to pose additional privacy
requirements.

TL;DR: This paper explores probabilistically stable belief revision operators and characterizes them through representation theorems, offering insights into the logic of probabilistically stable belief revision and its applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To formalize and explore the stability rule for belief, which links categorical belief with high credence propositions, and to characterize how belief dynamics comply with Bayesian conditioning within this framework.

Method: A representation theorem is proved to characterize the probabilistically stable revision operators, utilizing comparative probability orders and providing conditions for selection functions to represent strongest-stable-set operators on finite probability spaces.

Result: The study delivers a logic of probabilistically stable belief revision that has strong monotonicity but diverges from AGM postulates. Additionally, it derives conditions for joint representation of comparative probability orders and logic of ratio comparisons.

Conclusion: The paper makes significant contributions to the theory of belief revision, comparative probability, and its applications in areas like voting games and revealed preference theory, while highlighting limitations in meeting traditional case reasoning postulates.

Abstract: The stability rule for belief, advocated by Leitgeb [Annals of Pure and
Applied Logic 164, 2013], is a rule for rational acceptance that captures
categorical belief in terms of $\textit{probabilistically stable
propositions}$: propositions to which the agent assigns resiliently high
credence. The stability rule generates a class of $\textit{probabilistically
stable belief revision}$ operators, which capture the dynamics of belief that
result from an agent updating their credences through Bayesian conditioning
while complying with the stability rule for their all-or-nothing beliefs. In
this paper, we prove a representation theorem that yields a complete
characterisation of such probabilistically stable revision operators and
provides a `qualitative' selection function semantics for the (non-monotonic)
logic of probabilistically stable belief revision. Drawing on the theory of
comparative probability orders, this result gives necessary and sufficient
conditions for a selection function to be representable as a
strongest-stable-set operator on a finite probability space. The resulting
logic of probabilistically stable belief revision exhibits strong monotonicity
properties while failing the AGM belief revision postulates and satisfying only
very weak forms of case reasoning. In showing the main theorem, we prove two
results of independent interest to the theory of comparative probability: the
first provides necessary and sufficient conditions for the joint representation
of a pair of (respectively, strict and non-strict) comparative probability
orders. The second result provides a method for axiomatising the logic of ratio
comparisons of the form ``event $A$ is at least $k$ times more likely than
event $B$''. In addition to these measurement-theoretic applications, we point
out two applications of our main result to the theory of simple voting games
and to revealed preference theory.

Main category: hep-ex

TL;DR: This paper investigates the phenomenon of 'double descent' in overparameterized models within particle physics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and understand the behavior of overparameterized models that exceed the interpolation threshold in particle physics, motivated by their success in generalization error reduction in machine learning tasks.

Method: The researchers analyze particle physics data to identify the occurrence and properties of 'double descent,' systematically evaluating when overparameterization offers a performance advantage.

Result: Observed the double descent phenomenon in particle physics data and identified conditions where overparameterization enhances performance.

Conclusion: Overparameterized models can yield improved generalization performance, extending the double descent phenomenon beyond traditional machine learning tasks to particle physics studies.

Abstract: Recently, the benefit of heavily overparameterized models has been observed
in machine learning tasks: models with enough capacity to easily cross the
\emph{interpolation threshold} improve in generalization error compared to the
classical bias-variance tradeoff regime. We demonstrate this behavior for the
first time in particle physics data and explore when and where `double descent'
appears and under which circumstances overparameterization results in a
performance gain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve simulations and anomaly detection at the LHC by creating a generative model that effectively handles hybrid particle-cloud data with continuous and discrete properties.

Method: The authors propose a transformer-based multimodal flow leveraging flow-matching and a continuous-time Markov jump bridge to jointly model particle clouds in terms of kinematic features and quantum numbers.

Result: The model, trained on CMS Open Data, is capable of producing high-fidelity jets that exhibit realistic kinematics, jet substructures, and accurate flavor composition.

Conclusion: This transformer-based model represents a significant step forward in generative modeling for particle physics, enabling sophisticated simulations and enhancing anomaly detection capabilities.

Abstract: Generative modeling of high-energy collisions at the Large Hadron Collider
(LHC) offers a data-driven route to simulations, anomaly detection, among other
applications. A central challenge lies in the hybrid nature of particle-cloud
data: each particle carries continuous kinematic features and discrete quantum
numbers such as charge and flavor. We introduce a transformer-based multimodal
flow that extends flow-matching with a continuous-time Markov jump bridge to
jointly model LHC jets with both modalities. Trained on CMS Open Data, our
model can generate high fidelity jets with realistic kinematics, jet
substructure and flavor composition.

*Xiaonan Zhu,Bingyan Wang,Jianqing Fan*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: This paper presents a simple method to enhance supervised learning algorithms by using PCA-based feature augmentation, showcasing improved performance across various datasets including financial applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address high-dimensional data correlations and over-parameterization issues in supervised learning algorithms, particularly in financial prediction and other diverse fields.

Method: The proposed method involves augmenting features with PCA factors and idiosyncratic residuals derived from design matrices and their transformations to reduce correlations and enhance interpretability.

Result: Experimental evaluation demonstrates improved prediction performance across diverse datasets, with a focus on financial stock return prediction using Chinese news data.

Conclusion: The approach boosts learning algorithm performance without requiring extra data or more complex algorithm designs, bridging a critical gap in previous literature.

Abstract: High-dimensional measurements are often correlated which motivates their
approximation by factor models. This holds also true when features are
engineered via low-dimensional interactions or kernel tricks. This often
results in over parametrization and requires a fast dimensionality reduction.
We propose a simple technique to enhance the performance of supervised learning
algorithms by augmenting features with factors extracted from design matrices
and their transformations. This is implemented by using the factors and
idiosyncratic residuals which significantly weaken the correlations between
input variables and hence increase the interpretability of learning algorithms
and numerical stability. Extensive experiments on various algorithms and
real-world data in diverse fields are carried out, among which we put special
emphasis on the stock return prediction problem with Chinese financial news
data due to the increasing interest in NLP problems in financial studies. We
verify the capability of the proposed feature augmentation approach to boost
overall prediction performance with the same algorithm. The approach bridges a
gap in research that has been overlooked in previous studies, which focus
either on collecting additional data or constructing more powerful algorithms,
whereas our method lies in between these two directions using a simple PCA
augmentation.

*Bhima Sankar Manthina,Shreyash Gujar,Sachin Chaudhari,Kavita Vemuri1,Shivam Chhirolya*

Main category: cs.ET

TL;DR: The study introduces an IoT-based, mobile noise monitoring system using sensor-equipped vehicles, achieving accurate real-time noise mapping in urban environments like Hyderabad, India.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban noise pollution threatens public health, and existing monitoring systems lack sufficient spatial coverage and adaptability, motivating the need for scalable and real-time monitoring solutions.

Method: An IoT system integrates low-cost sound sensors with GPS to collect geotagged noise data, calibrated using several ML algorithms. Moving vehicles serve as mobile sensing nodes to gather real-time noise data, with calibration adjusted for mobile conditions to enhance accuracy.

Result: Random Forest Regression yielded the best calibration accuracy in mobile scenarios (R2 = 0.937, RMSE = 1.09). Deployment in Hyderabad collected 436,420 noise data points, revealing spatial and temporal variations influenced by events like Diwali.

Conclusion: The system enables scalable IoT-based noise monitoring, offering a valuable tool for noise pollution management and urban planning, particularly in smart cities.

Abstract: Urban noise pollution poses a significant threat to public health, yet
existing monitoring infrastructures offer limited spatial coverage and
adaptability. This paper presents a scalable, low-cost, IoT-based, real-time
environmental noise monitoring solution using mobile nodes (sensor nodes on a
moving vehicle). The system utilizes a low-cost sound sensor integrated with
GPS-enabled modules to collect geotagged noise data at one-second intervals.
The sound nodes are calibrated against a reference sound level meter in a
laboratory setting to ensure accuracy using various machine learning (ML)
algorithms, such as Simple Linear Regression (SLR), Multiple Linear Regression
(MLR), Polynomial Regression (PR), Segmented Regression (SR), Support Vector
Regression (SVR), Decision Tree (DT), and Random Forest Regression (RFR). While
laboratory calibration demonstrates high accuracy, it is shown that the
performance of the nodes degrades during data collection in a moving vehicle.
To address this, it is demonstrated that the calibration must be performed on
the IoT-based node based on the data collected in a moving environment along
with the reference device. Among the employed ML models, RFR achieved the best
performance with an R2 of 0.937 and RMSE of 1.09 for mobile calibration. The
system was deployed in Hyderabad, India, through three measurement campaigns
across 27 days, capturing 436,420 data points. Results highlight temporal and
spatial noise variations across weekdays, weekends, and during Diwali.
Incorporating vehicular velocity into the calibration significantly improves
accuracy. The proposed system demonstrates the potential for widespread
deployment of IoT-based noise sensing networks in smart cities, enabling
effective noise pollution management and urban planning.

### [929] [Quantum game models for interaction-aware decision-making in automated driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01582)
*Karim Essalmi,Fernando Garrido,Fawzi Nashashibi*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper introduces quantum game models, QG-U1 and QG-G4, for improving interaction-aware decision-making in automated driving. These models outperform traditional and classical game-theoretic methods in certain traffic scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional decision-making methods in automated driving fail to effectively model interactions with other agents, leading to overly cautious behavior. The research seeks to improve decision-making through advanced models incorporating quantum mechanics.

Method: The authors propose two quantum game models, QG-U1 and QG-G4, which leverage quantum mechanics principles like superposition and entanglement. These models are designed for two-player games and are evaluated in merging and roundabout scenarios against baseline methods.

Result: QG-G4 showed lower collision rates and higher success rates than baseline methods, and both quantum models achieved higher expected payoffs in comparison to classical game-theoretic approaches.

Conclusion: Quantum game models provide an effective framework to enhance decision-making in autonomous driving, addressing interaction challenges better than traditional methods.

Abstract: Decision-making in automated driving must consider interactions with
surrounding agents to be effective. However, traditional methods often neglect
or oversimplify these interactions because they are difficult to model and
solve, which can lead to overly conservative behavior of the ego vehicle. To
address this gap, we propose two quantum game models, QG-U1 (Quantum Game -
Unitary 1) and QG-G4 (Quantum Game - Gates 4), for interaction-aware
decision-making. These models extend classical game theory by incorporating
principles of quantum mechanics, such as superposition, interference, and
entanglement. Specifically, QG-U1 and QG-G4 are designed for two-player games
with two strategies per player and can be executed in real time on a standard
computer without requiring quantum hardware. We evaluate both models in merging
and roundabout scenarios and compare them with classical game-theoretic methods
and baseline approaches (IDM, MOBIL, and a utility-based technique). Results
show that QG-G4 achieves lower collision rates and higher success rates
compared to baseline methods, while both quantum models yield higher expected
payoffs than classical game approaches under certain parameter settings.

### [930] [Playing Markov Games Without Observing Payoffs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00179)
*Daniel Ablin,Alon Cohen*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper extends symmetric zero-sum game concepts to Markov games and presents algorithms that allow a player to compete without payoff information using online learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of performing well in multi-agent systems with limited information, particularly in zero-sum symmetric Markov games where payoff observations are unavailable.

Method: The authors introduce three types of symmetry for zero-sum symmetric Markov games and develop algorithms that reduce the problem to online learning. These algorithms use observed opponent actions and transition dynamics to enable efficient competition.

Result: The paper demonstrates that players can asymptotically match opponents' returns despite not observing payoffs. The presented algorithms are applicable to both matrix and Markov games and run in polynomial time.

Conclusion: Robust learning under informational disadvantages is feasible in a broader range of games by extending online learning methods to zero-sum symmetric Markov games, enhancing their application in adversarial settings.

Abstract: Optimization under uncertainty is a fundamental problem in learning and
decision-making, particularly in multi-agent systems. Previously, Feldman,
Kalai, and Tennenholtz [2010] demonstrated the ability to efficiently compete
in repeated symmetric two-player matrix games without observing payoffs, as
long as the opponents actions are observed. In this paper, we introduce and
formalize a new class of zero-sum symmetric Markov games, which extends the
notion of symmetry from matrix games to the Markovian setting. We show that
even without observing payoffs, a player who knows the transition dynamics and
observes only the opponents sequence of actions can still compete against an
adversary who may have complete knowledge of the game. We formalize three
distinct notions of symmetry in this setting and show that, under these
conditions, the learning problem can be reduced to an instance of online
learning, enabling the player to asymptotically match the return of the
opponent despite lacking payoff observations. Our algorithms apply to both
matrix and Markov games, and run in polynomial time with respect to the size of
the game and the number of episodes. Our work broadens the class of games in
which robust learning is possible under severe informational disadvantage and
deepens the connection between online learning and adversarial game theory.

### [931] [Entry Barriers in Content Markets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01953)

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper studies how entry barriers and reward mechanisms can improve content quality on online platforms through game-theoretic analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The abundance of low-quality content online is linked to the lack of entry barriers. The paper explores whether introducing entry barriers and reward mechanisms can enhance content quality.

Method: A game-theoretic analysis is applied to investigate structural barriers due to existing contributors and strategic barriers by imposing entry fees, coupled with reward redistribution.

Result: Both structural barriers formed at equilibrium and strategic barriers using entry fees showed potential for improving content quality.

Conclusion: Designing entry barriers alongside reward mechanisms can theoretically drive better content quality and healthier online ecosystems.

Abstract: The prevalence of low-quality content on online platforms is often attributed
to the absence of meaningful entry requirements. This motivates us to
investigate whether implicit or explicit entry barriers, alongside appropriate
reward mechanisms, can enhance content quality. We present the first
game-theoretic analysis of two distinct types of entry barriers in online
content platforms. The first, a structural barrier, emerges from the collective
behaviour of incumbent content providers which disadvantages new entrants. We
show that both rank-order and proportional-share reward mechanisms induce such
a structural barrier at Nash equilibrium. The second, a strategic barrier,
involves the platform proactively imposing entry fees to discourage
participation from low-quality contributors. We consider a scheme in which the
platform redirects some or all of the entry fees into the reward pool. We
formally demonstrate that this approach can improve overall content quality.
Our findings establish a theoretical foundation for designing reward mechanisms
coupled with entry fees to promote higher-quality content and support healthier
online ecosystems.

Result: The integration of AI/ML for DSM in satellite networks is categorized and evaluated for robustness, offering insights for enhanced adaptability in cognitive satellite networks.

Conclusion: Advancing regulatory frameworks, network architectures, and intelligent spectrum management is critical for achieving sustainable and scalable global SatCom networks.

Abstract: Satellite Communication (SatCom) networks represent a fundamental pillar in
modern global connectivity, facilitating reliable service and extensive
coverage across a plethora of applications. The expanding demand for
high-bandwidth services and the proliferation of mega satellite constellations
highlight the limitations of traditional exclusive satellite spectrum
allocation approaches. Cognitive Radio (CR) leading to Cognitive Satellite

hurdles in regulations and standardizations in realizing intelligent DSM in
SatCom, and deep dive into DSM techniques, which enable CogSat networks.
Furthermore, we extensively evaluate and categorize state-of-the-art Artificial
Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML) methods leveraged for DSM while
exploring operational resilience and robustness of such integrations. In
addition, performance evaluation metrics critical for adaptive resource
management and system optimization in CogSat networks are thoroughly
investigated. This survey also identifies open challenges and outlines future
research directions in regulatory frameworks, network architectures, and
intelligent spectrum management, paving the way for sustainable and scalable
SatCom networks for enhanced global connectivity.

*Kun Qiu,Ying Wang,Baoqian Li,Wenjun Zhu*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The study proposes an unsupervised framework for cleaning encrypted mobile traffic data to reduce manual inspection's high cost and effort. It achieves almost the same classification accuracy as manual methods with a minimal 2-2.5% variance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the inefficiency of manual traffic data cleaning, which is expensive and time-consuming, especially with the increasing adoption of encryption in mobile applications.

Method: The authors developed an unsupervised framework for automatic cleaning of encrypted mobile traffic, removing irrelevant or non-useful flows before training.

Result: The framework achieves a minimal reduction in classification accuracy (2-2.5%) compared to manual data cleaning methods when evaluated on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides an efficient and effective preprocessing step for machine learning-based encrypted traffic classification, enabling practical deployment in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Traffic classification, a technique for assigning network flows to predefined
categories, has been widely deployed in enterprise and carrier networks. With
the massive adoption of mobile devices, encryption is increasingly used in
mobile applications to address privacy concerns. Consequently, traditional
methods such as Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) fail to distinguish encrypted
traffic. To tackle this challenge, Artificial Intelligence (AI), in particular
Machine Learning (ML), has emerged as a promising solution for encrypted
traffic classification. A crucial prerequisite for any ML-based approach is
traffic data cleaning, which removes flows that are not useful for training
(e.g., irrelevant protocols, background activity, control-plane messages, and
long-lived sessions). Existing cleaning solutions depend on manual inspection
of every captured packet, making the process both costly and time-consuming. In
this poster, we present an unsupervised framework that automatically cleans
encrypted mobile traffic. Evaluation on real-world datasets shows that our
framework incurs only a 2%~2.5% reduction in classification accuracy compared
with manual cleaning. These results demonstrate that our method offers an
efficient and effective preprocessing step for ML-based encrypted traffic
classification.

TL;DR: This paper integrates Quantum Machine Learning (QML) and Quantum-Inspired (QI) techniques to optimize end-to-end network services in 5G networks. Results show QML provides similar or superior accuracy to classical ML, with lower inference times and better handling of high-dimensional data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize Quality of Experience (QoE) for cellular networks, especially for advanced services like Cloud Gaming, using cutting-edge technologies like QML and QI.

Method: The study proposes a hybrid framework that combines quantum and classical computing for network service optimization. It evaluates QML and QI algorithms alongside classical ML models through performance metrics such as accuracy, inference times, and solution scores.

Result: QML models outperform or match classical ML in accuracy, reduce inference and model loading times, and show potential for handling higher-complexity problems effectively.

Conclusion: QML holds significant promise for network optimization, especially in complex scenarios, but challenges like data availability and integration between quantum and classical methods need further exploration.

Abstract: This work explores the integration of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) and
Quantum-Inspired (QI) techniques for optimizing end-to-end (E2E) network
services in telecommunication systems, particularly focusing on 5G networks and
beyond. The application of QML and QI algorithms is investigated, comparing
their performance with classical Machine Learning (ML) approaches. The present
study employs a hybrid framework combining quantum and classical computing
leveraging the strengths of QML and QI, without the penalty of quantum hardware
availability. This is particularized for the optimization of the Quality of
Experience (QoE) over cellular networks. The framework comprises an estimator
for obtaining the expected QoE based on user metrics, service settings, and
cell configuration, and an optimizer that uses the estimation to choose the
best cell and service configuration. Although the approach is applicable to any
QoE-based network management, its implementation is particularized for the
optimization of network configurations for Cloud Gaming services. Then, it is
evaluated via performance metrics such as accuracy and model loading and
inference times for the estimator, and time to solution and solution score for
the optimizer. The results indicate that QML models achieve similar or superior
accuracy to classical ML models for estimation, while decreasing inference and
loading times. Furthermore, potential for better performance is observed for
higher-dimensional data, highlighting promising results for higher complexity
problems. Thus, the results demonstrate the promising potential of QML in
advancing network optimization, although challenges related to data
availability and integration complexities between quantum and classical ML are
identified as future research lines.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Unified Twin Transformation (UTT) framework for efficiently managing Network Digital Twins (NDTs), enabling tasks such as merging, splitting, and resource optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in constructing Network Digital Twins (NDTs), including data integration, scalability, and efficient task management.

Method: The Unified Twin Transformation (UTT) framework employs joint multi-modal and distributed mapping mechanisms to optimize NDT functionality, with theoretical analysis on distributed mapping to ensure consistency.

Result: The framework demonstrates effectiveness in real-world applications like trajectory reconstruction and human localization, proving the value of NDT interoperability.

Conclusion: UTT facilitates efficient operation of NDTs by reducing costs, improving scalability, and enabling task-specific adaptability.

Abstract: The integration of digital twinning technologies is driving next-generation
networks toward new capabilities, allowing operators to thoroughly understand
network conditions, efficiently analyze valuable radio data, and innovate
applications through user-friendly, immersive interfaces. Building on this
foundation, network digital twins (NDTs) accurately depict the operational
processes and attributes of network infrastructures, facilitating predictive
management through real-time analysis and measurement. However, constructing
precise NDTs poses challenges, such as integrating diverse data sources,
mapping necessary attributes from physical networks, and maintaining
scalability for various downstream tasks. Unlike previous works that focused on
the creation and mapping of NDTs from scratch, we explore intra- and
inter-operations among NDTs within a Unified Twin Transformation (UTT)
framework, which uncovers a new computing paradigm for efficient transfer,
merging, and splitting of NDTs to create task-oriented twins. By leveraging
joint multi-modal and distributed mapping mechanisms, UTT optimizes resource
utilization and reduces the cost of creating NDTs, while ensuring twin model
consistency. A theoretical analysis of the distributed mapping problem is
conducted to establish convergence bounds for this multi-modal gated
aggregation process. Evaluations on real-world twin-assisted applications, such
as trajectory reconstruction, human localization, and sensory data generation,
demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of interoperability among NDTs
for corresponding task development.

*Mridul Kumar,Yevgeny Rakita*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: The study applies unsupervised machine learning to 4D-STEM data to uncover compositional and structural variations in Ge-Sb-Te phase-change materials (PCMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address challenges in resolving nanoscale variations in composition and structure in Ge-Sb-Te alloys, which are key to their functional properties but hard to analyze using traditional methods.

Method: The methodology involved dimensionality reduction through PCA, cluster validation using t-SNE and UMAP, and optimized k-means clustering using silhouette scoring to analyze 4D-STEM data.

Result: Four distinct compositional and structural clusters were identified and mapped to diffraction data, revealing unique chemical signatures for each cluster and confirming structural variations.

Conclusion: Clustering analysis provides a robust framework to correlate local chemical and structural characteristics, offering new insights into the intrinsic heterogeneity of phase-change materials.

Abstract: Phase-change materials (PCMs) such as Ge-Sb-Te alloys are widely used in
non-volatile memory applications due to their rapid and reversible switching
between amorphous and crystalline states. However, their functional properties
are strongly governed by nanoscale variations in composition and structure,
which are challenging to resolve using conventional techniques. Here, we apply
unsupervised machine learning to 4-dimensional scanning transmission electron
microscopy (4D-STEM) data to identify compositional and structural
heterogeneity in Ge-Sb-Te. After preprocessing and dimensionality reduction
with principal component analysis (PCA), cluster validation was performed with
t-SNE and UMAP, followed by k-means clustering optimized through silhouette
scoring. Four distinct clusters were identified which were mapped back to the
diffraction data. Elemental intensity histograms revealed chemical signatures
change across clusters, oxygen and germanium enrichment in Cluster 1, tellurium
in Cluster 2, antimony in Cluster 3, and germanium again in Cluster 4.
Furthermore, averaged diffraction patterns from these clusters confirmed
structural variations. Together, these findings demonstrate that clustering
analysis can provide a powerful framework for correlating local chemical and
structural features in PCMs, offering deeper insights into their intrinsic
heterogeneity.

Conclusion: ML not only enhances the efficiency of fractal classification but also aids in generating new mathematic insights, suggesting its utility in advancing pure mathematics research.

Abstract: Recent developments in applied mathematics increasingly employ machine
learning (ML)-particularly supervised learning-to accelerate numerical
computations, such as solving nonlinear partial differential equations. In this
work, we extend such techniques to objects of a more theoretical nature: the
classification and structural analysis of fractal sets. Focusing on the
Mandelbrot and Julia sets as principal examples, we demonstrate that supervised
learning methods-including Classification and Regression Trees (CART),
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP), and Recurrent Neural
Networks using both Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional LSTM
(BiLSTM), Random Forests (RF), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)-can
classify fractal points with significantly higher predictive accuracy and
substantially lower computational cost than traditional numerical approaches,
such as the thresholding technique. These improvements are consistent across a
range of models and evaluation metrics. Notably, KNN and RF exhibit the best
overall performance, and comparative analyses between models (e.g., KNN vs.
LSTM) suggest the presence of novel regularity properties in these mathematical
structures. Collectively, our findings indicate that ML not only enhances
classification efficiency but also offers promising avenues for generating new
insights, intuitions, and conjectures within pure mathematics.

### [938] [ERank: Fusing Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning for Effective and Efficient Text Reranking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00520)
*Yuzheng Cai,Yanzhao Zhang,Dingkun Long,Mingxin Li,Pengjun Xie,Weiguo Zheng*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: ERank is a new reranking method using reasoning-based LLMs to improve efficiency and effectiveness in various text retrieval scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the trade-off between efficiency and scoring discrimination in current reranking methods. Pointwise models lack refined scoring, while listwise models are too computationally expensive.

Method: ERank combines a two-stage training pipeline: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to generate fine-grained integer scores for relevance, followed by Reinforcement Learning with listwise-derived rewards to instill global ranking awareness.

Result: ERank demonstrates superior performance on benchmarks like BRIGHT, FollowIR, TREC DL, and BEIR. In particular, it achieves state-of-the-art results on the reasoning-intensive BRIGHT benchmark with nDCG@10 scores of 38.7 for the 4B model and 40.2 for the 32B variant.

Conclusion: ERank merges efficiency with high ranking effectiveness by innovatively combining fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, achieving robust and superior reranking outcomes.

Abstract: Text reranking models are a crucial component in modern systems like
Retrieval-Augmented Generation, tasked with selecting the most relevant
documents prior to generation. However, current Large Language Models (LLMs)
powered rerankers often face a fundamental trade-off. On one hand, Supervised
Fine-Tuning based pointwise methods that frame relevance as a binary
classification task lack the necessary scoring discrimination, particularly for
those built on reasoning LLMs. On the other hand, approaches designed for
complex reasoning often employ powerful yet inefficient listwise formulations,
rendering them impractical for low latency applications. To resolve this
dilemma, we introduce ERank, a highly effective and efficient pointwise
reranker built from a reasoning LLM that excels across diverse relevance
scenarios. We propose a novel two-stage training pipeline that begins with
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). In this stage, we move beyond binary labels and
train the model generatively to output fine grained integer scores, which
significantly enhances relevance discrimination. The model is then further
refined using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a novel, listwise derived
reward. This technique instills global ranking awareness into the efficient
pointwise architecture. We evaluate the ERank reranker on the BRIGHT, FollowIR,
TREC DL, and BEIR benchmarks, demonstrating superior effectiveness and
robustness compared to existing approaches. On the reasoning-intensive BRIGHT
benchmark, our ERank-4B achieves an nDCG@10 of 38.7, while a larger 32B variant
reaches a state of the art nDCG@10 of 40.2.

### [939] [Beyond Negative Transfer: Disentangled Preference-Guided Diffusion for Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00389)
*Xiaoxin Ye,Chengkai Huang,Hongtao Huang,Lina Yao*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper presents DPG-Diff, a novel diffusion-based approach for Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) that effectively disentangles domain-invariant and domain-specific preferences, mitigating noise and negative transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges in CDSR, specifically issues arising from conflicting domain-specific preferences and noisy behaviors like misclicks. These challenges are further amplified by domain heterogeneity and the need to disentangle complex user preferences.

Method: The authors introduce DPG-Diff, a Disentangled Preference-Guided Diffusion Model, which decomposes user preferences into domain-invariant and domain-specific components. This disentanglement guides the reverse diffusion process for improved cross-domain knowledge transfer and noise filtering.

Result: DPG-Diff demonstrated superior performance against state-of-the-art methods across various metrics in real-world datasets, showcasing its effectiveness in mitigating negative transfer and capturing evolving user preferences.

Conclusion: DPG-Diff successfully addresses key challenges in CDSR by leveraging its novel disentanglement framework and diffusion-based approach, making it a robust solution for enhancing recommendation quality across domains.

Abstract: Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) leverages user behaviors across
domains to enhance recommendation quality. However, naive aggregation of
sequential signals can introduce conflicting domain-specific preferences,
leading to negative transfer. While Sequential Recommendation (SR) already
suffers from noisy behaviors such as misclicks and impulsive actions, CDSR
further amplifies this issue due to domain heterogeneity arising from diverse
item types and user intents. The core challenge is disentangling three
intertwined signals: domain-invariant preferences, domain-specific preferences,
and noise. Diffusion Models (DMs) offer a generative denoising framework
well-suited for disentangling complex user preferences and enhancing robustness
to noise. Their iterative refinement process enables gradual denoising, making
them effective at capturing subtle preference signals. However, existing
applications in recommendation face notable limitations: sequential DMs often
conflate shared and domain-specific preferences, while cross-domain
collaborative filtering DMs neglect temporal dynamics, limiting their ability
to model evolving user preferences. To bridge these gaps, we propose
\textbf{DPG-Diff}, a novel Disentangled Preference-Guided Diffusion Model, the
first diffusion-based approach tailored for CDSR, to or best knowledge.
DPG-Diff decomposes user preferences into domain-invariant and domain-specific
components, which jointly guide the reverse diffusion process. This
disentangled guidance enables robust cross-domain knowledge transfer, mitigates
negative transfer, and filters sequential noise. Extensive experiments on
real-world datasets demonstrate that DPG-Diff consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics.

Motivation: The motivation of the paper is to address cold-start relevance matching challenges encountered in emerging markets, where there are limited human labels and user behaviors, by leveraging advanced AI techniques.

Method: The proposed method involves utilizing a multilingual Large Language Model (LLM) with three specific actions: cross-lingual transfer learning via machine translation, retrieval-based query augmentation for e-commerce knowledge, and multi-round self-distillation to mitigate training label errors.

Result: The experiments demonstrate successful deployment of CSRM-LLM, yielding significant improvements such as a 45.8% reduction in defect ratio and a 0.866% increase in session purchase rate.

Conclusion: The CSRM framework effectively leverages advanced LLM techniques to tackle cold-start challenges in e-commerce platforms, delivering measurable improvements in real-world performance.

Abstract: As global e-commerce platforms continue to expand, companies are entering new
markets where they encounter cold-start challenges due to limited human labels
and user behaviors. In this paper, we share our experiences in Coupang to
provide a competitive cold-start performance of relevance matching for emerging
e-commerce markets. Specifically, we present a Cold-Start Relevance Matching
(CSRM) framework, utilizing a multilingual Large Language Model (LLM) to
address three challenges: (1) activating cross-lingual transfer learning
abilities of LLMs through machine translation tasks; (2) enhancing query
understanding and incorporating e-commerce knowledge by retrieval-based query
augmentation; (3) mitigating the impact of training label errors through a
multi-round self-distillation training strategy. Our experiments demonstrate

*Theodor Stoecker,Samed Bayer,Ingo Weber*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper reviews bias mitigation methods for recommender systems in dynamic AI feedback loops, organizing key studies into a taxonomy for practical and research use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the long-term fairness issues caused by recommender systems retraining on biased user reactions.

Method: A systematic review of 347 papers, focusing on mitigation techniques validated in multi-round simulations or live tests.

Result: The study identifies 24 primary papers, categorizing them into six dimensions, and highlights gaps such as limited shared simulators and inconsistent evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: The taxonomy offers actionable guidelines for industry and underscores research gaps, promoting fairness and performance in recommender systems.

Abstract: Recommender systems continually retrain on user reactions to their own
predictions, creating AI feedback loops that amplify biases and diminish
fairness over time. Despite this well-known risk, most bias mitigation
techniques are tested only on static splits, so their long-term fairness across
multiple retraining rounds remains unclear. We therefore present a systematic
literature review of bias mitigation methods that explicitly consider AI
feedback loops and are validated in multi-round simulations or live A/B tests.
Screening 347 papers yields 24 primary studies published between 2019-2025.
Each study is coded on six dimensions: mitigation technique, biases addressed,
dynamic testing set-up, evaluation focus, application domain, and ML task,
organising them into a reusable taxonomy. The taxonomy offers industry
practitioners a quick checklist for selecting robust methods and gives
researchers a clear roadmap to the field's most urgent gaps. Examples include
the shortage of shared simulators, varying evaluation metrics, and the fact
that most studies report either fairness or performance; only six use both.

### [942] [Algorithm Adaptation Bias in Recommendation System Online Experiments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00199)
*Chen Zheng,Zhenyu Zhao*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper investigates algorithm adaptation bias in A/B tests for recommender systems caused by interactions between user data, production models, and training pipelines, leading to misleading experimental results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored but critical issue of algorithm adaptation bias, which can distort online evaluation in recommender systems and hinder accurate decision-making.

Method: The paper analyzes the mechanisms of algorithm adaptation bias, provides empirical evidence from real-world experiments, and discusses potential solutions for improved experimental design and evaluation.

Result: Empirical findings highlight the prevalence and impact of algorithm adaptation bias on online A/B testing, showing it often leads to overestimating the incumbent system and underestimating alternatives.

Conclusion: Algorithm adaptation bias can significantly distort recommender system evaluations, and addressing this requires comprehensive changes to experimental design, measurement techniques, and adjustment strategies.

Abstract: Online experiments (A/B tests) are widely regarded as the gold standard for
evaluating recommender system variants and guiding launch decisions. However, a
variety of biases can distort the results of the experiment and mislead
decision-making. An underexplored but critical bias is algorithm adaptation
effect. This bias arises from the flywheel dynamics among production models,
user data, and training pipelines: new models are evaluated on user data whose
distributions are shaped by the incumbent system or tested only in a small
treatment group. As a result, the measured effect of a new product change in
modeling and user experience in this constrained experimental setting can
diverge substantially from its true impact in full deployment. In practice, the
experiment results often favor the production variant with large traffic while
underestimating the performance of the test variant with small traffic, which
leads to missing opportunities to launch a true winning arm or underestimating
the impact. This paper aims to raise awareness of algorithm adaptation bias,
situate it within the broader landscape of RecSys evaluation biases, and
motivate discussion of solutions that span experiment design, measurement, and
adjustment. We detail the mechanisms of this bias, present empirical evidence
from real-world experiments, and discuss potential methods for a more robust
online evaluation.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Re3,' a framework, addressing temporal relevance and recency in search retrieval systems using dynamic balancing. It achieves state-of-the-art results on a new benchmark, Re2Bench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unresolved task of retrieving search documents that fulfill both semantic information needs and strict temporal constraints.

Method: The authors create Re2Bench, a benchmark to evaluate relevance, recency, and their combination. They also develop Re3, a query-aware gating mechanism framework balancing semantic and temporal information.

Result: Re3 achieves state-of-the-art performance in retrieval tasks on Re2Bench, excelling in various settings and proving its efficacy through ablation and sensitivity tests.

Conclusion: The paper offers both a solution (Re3) and a benchmark (Re2Bench) to push advancements in temporally aware retrieval systems, with proven robustness and generalization across different scenarios.

Abstract: Temporal Information Retrieval (TIR) is a critical yet unresolved task for
modern search systems, retrieving documents that not only satisfy a query's
information need but also adhere to its temporal constraints. This task is
shaped by two challenges: Relevance, ensuring alignment with the query's
explicit temporal requirements, and Recency, selecting the freshest document
among multiple versions. Existing methods often address the two challenges in
isolation, relying on brittle heuristics that fail in scenarios where temporal
requirements and staleness resistance are intertwined. To address this gap, we
introduce Re2Bench, a benchmark specifically designed to disentangle and
evaluate Relevance, Recency, and their hybrid combination. Building on this
foundation, we propose Re3, a unified and lightweight framework that
dynamically balances semantic and temporal information through a query-aware
gating mechanism. On Re2Bench, Re3 achieves state-of-the-art results, leading
in R@1 across all three subsets. Ablation studies with backbone sensitivity
tests confirm robustness, showing strong generalization across diverse encoders
and real-world settings. This work provides both a generalizable solution and a
principled evaluation suite, advancing the development of temporally aware
retrieval systems. Re3 and Re2Bench are available online:

TL;DR: The paper introduces MME-SID, a framework utilizing LLMs, multimodal embeddings, and MM-RQ-VAE to tackle embedding collapse and catastrophic forgetting in sequential recommendation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges like embedding collapse and catastrophic forgetting in large language model-based sequential recommendation systems.

Method: Propose MME-SID, integrating multimodal embeddings and a novel MM-RQ-VAE for preserving information and inter-modal correlations. Fine-tune LLMs using LoRA in a multimodal frequency-aware fusion process.

Result: Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate superior performance of MME-SID in mitigating embedding collapse and catastrophic forgetting, improving recommendation outcomes.

Conclusion: MME-SID effectively addresses critical limitations in LLM-based sequential recommendation frameworks, enhancing scalability and system performance.

Abstract: Sequential recommendation (SR) aims to capture users' dynamic interests and
sequential patterns based on their historical interactions. Recently, the
powerful capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have driven their
adoption in SR. However, we identify two critical challenges in existing
LLM-based SR methods: 1) embedding collapse when incorporating pre-trained
collaborative embeddings and 2) catastrophic forgetting of quantized embeddings
when utilizing semantic IDs. These issues dampen the model scalability and lead
to suboptimal recommendation performance. Therefore, based on LLMs like
Llama3-8B-instruct, we introduce a novel SR framework named MME-SID, which
integrates multimodal embeddings and quantized embeddings to mitigate embedding
collapse. Additionally, we propose a Multimodal Residual Quantized Variational
Autoencoder (MM-RQ-VAE) with maximum mean discrepancy as the reconstruction
loss and contrastive learning for alignment, which effectively preserve
intra-modal distance information and capture inter-modal correlations,
respectively. To further alleviate catastrophic forgetting, we initialize the
model with the trained multimodal code embeddings. Finally, we fine-tune the
LLM efficiently using LoRA in a multimodal frequency-aware fusion manner.
Extensive experiments on three public datasets validate the superior
performance of MME-SID thanks to its capability to mitigate embedding collapse
and catastrophic forgetting. The implementation code and datasets are publicly
available for reproduction:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of comprehensive approaches to diversifying news recommendations across multiple aspects, as current research largely focuses on single aspects like viewpoints.

Method: The paper proposes combining symbolic AI (knowledge graphs and rule learning) with subsymbolic AI for news recommendation diversification, with plans to assess models through user studies capturing behavior and perceived experience.

Result: While the results are not yet provided, the direction aims to enhance diversity in news recommendations and evaluate its impact on user experience and behavior.

Conclusion: The study aims to promote balanced news consumption, which could lead to benefits like increased serendipity for users and reduced societal polarization.

Abstract: News recommendations are complex, with diversity playing a vital role. So
far, existing literature predominantly focuses on specific aspects of news
diversity, such as viewpoints. In this paper, we introduce multi-aspect
diversification in four distinct recommendation modes and outline the nuanced
challenges in diversifying lists, sequences, summaries, and interactions. Our
proposed research direction combines symbolic and subsymbolic artificial
intelligence, leveraging both knowledge graphs and rule learning. We plan to
evaluate our models using user studies to not only capture behavior but also
their perceived experience. Our vision to balance news consumption points to
other positive effects for users (e.g., increased serendipity) and society

Result: Initial results show that LLMs are effective at extracting and presenting domain-specific knowledge, reducing the risk of knowledge loss, despite challenges in interpretability and handling rare domain-specific terms.

Conclusion: LLMs show significant promise in preserving and organizing specialized institutional knowledge, ensuring operational continuity in specialized fields, though further refinements are necessary.

Abstract: The large set of technical documentation of legacy accelerator systems,
coupled with the retirement of experienced personnel, underscores the urgent
need for efficient methods to preserve and transfer specialized knowledge. This
paper explores the application of large language models (LLMs), to automate and
enhance the extraction of information from particle accelerator technical

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: This paper addresses limitations in community deception methods for graphs, proposing new metrics and strategies to optimize "unnoticeable" deception attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance privacy and security in graphs by addressing shortcomings in existing community deception methods.

Method: They introduce a new deception metric, model community deception tasks as multi-objective optimization problems, and propose node selection mechanisms.

Result: Empirical studies and extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show improved deception performance using the proposed methods.

Conclusion: The new deception strategies outperform traditional approaches, enhancing privacy while being less noticeable.

Abstract: Community detection in graphs is crucial for understanding the organization
of nodes into densely connected clusters. While numerous strategies have been
developed to identify these clusters, the success of community detection can
lead to privacy and information security concerns, as individuals may not want
their personal information exposed. To address this, community deception
methods have been proposed to reduce the effectiveness of detection algorithms.
Nevertheless, several limitations, such as the rationality of evaluation
metrics and the unnoticeability of attacks, have been ignored in current
deception methods. Therefore, in this work, we first investigate the
limitations of the widely used deception metric, i.e., the decrease of
modularity, through empirical studies. Then, we propose a new deception metric,
and combine this new metric together with the attack budget to model the
unnoticeable community deception task as a multi-objective optimization
problem. To further improve the deception performance, we propose two variant
methods by incorporating the degree-biased and community-biased candidate node
selection mechanisms. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed community deception strategies.

TL;DR: This study analyzed 10,000 YouTube videos related to COVID-19 (2023-2024), exploring factors like timing, content, and duration on viewer engagement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand the factors influencing engagement patterns on COVID-related YouTube videos during the late pandemic.

Method: Analyzed video metadata, titles, descriptions, duration, and sentiment using statistical and frequency analysis (e.g., Pearson, Spearman).

Result: Consistent engagement peaks were found on specific weekdays, titles with "shorts" gained high views, sentiment showed weak to strong correlation with views post-outlier removal, and engagement varied by category and duration.

Conclusion: Engagement patterns are shaped by a mix of temporal habits, lexical/linguistic features, and content-specific characteristics.

Abstract: This work investigated about 10,000 COVID-19-related YouTube videos published
between January 2023 and October 2024 to evaluate how temporal, lexical,
linguistic, and structural factors influenced engagement during the late
pandemic period. Publishing activity showed consistent weekday effects: in the
first window, average views peaked on Mondays at 92,658; in the second, on
Wednesdays at 115,479; and in the third, on Fridays at 84,874, reflecting a
shift in audience attention toward mid- and late week. Lexical analysis of
video titles revealed recurring high-frequency keywords related to COVID-19 and
YouTube features, including COVID, coronavirus, shorts, and live. Frequency
analysis revealed sharp spikes, with COVID appearing in 799 video titles in
August 2024, while engagement analysis showed that videos titled with shorts
attracted very high views, peaking at 2.16 million average views per video in
June 2023. Analysis of sentiment of video descriptions in English showed weak
correlation with views in the raw data (Pearson r = 0.0154, p = 0.2987), but
stronger correlations emerged once outliers were addressed, with Spearman r =
0.110 (p < 0.001) and Pearson r = 0.0925 (p < 0.001). Category-level analysis
of video durations revealed contrasting outcomes: long videos focusing on
people and blogs averaged 209,114 views, short entertainment videos averaged
288,675 views, and medium-to-long news and politics videos averaged 51,309 and
59,226 views, respectively. These results demonstrate that engagement patterns
of COVID-19-related videos on YouTube during the late pandemic followed
distinct characteristics driven by publishing schedules, title vocabulary,
topics, and genre-specific duration effects.

TL;DR: The paper introduces OASIS, a Computation-Enabled Object Storage (COS) system designed for flexibility, broad operator support, and optimized deep storage hierarchy usage, achieving up to a 32.7% performance improvement over existing systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing COS systems, like MinIO and Ceph, face limitations in output format flexibility, operator support, and storage hierarchy optimization, restricting their utility in handling SQL-based large-scale data analysis in High-Performance Computing environments.

Method: OASIS introduces enhancements such as flexible output delivery with diverse formats, support for complex operators and array-aware expressions, and optimized execution paths for deep storage hierarchies. It was integrated into the Spark framework for validation.

Result: Experimental evaluation shows that OASIS outperforms existing COS-based systems, with up to a 32.7% performance boost in handling real-world scientific queries.

Conclusion: OASIS significantly improves the efficiency and flexibility of COS systems in HPC environments, making them more applicable for advanced data analysis tasks through its optimized architecture and broad operator support.

Abstract: Computation-Enabled Object Storage (COS) systems, such as MinIO and Ceph,
have recently emerged as promising storage solutions for post hoc, SQL-based
analysis on large-scale datasets in High-Performance Computing (HPC)
environments. By supporting object-granular layouts, COS facilitates
column-oriented access and supports in-storage execution of data reduction
operators, such as filters, close to where the data resides. Despite growing
interest and adoption, existing COS systems exhibit several fundamental
limitations that hinder their effectiveness. First, they impose rigid
constraints on output data formats, limiting flexibility and interoperability.
Second, they support offloading for only a narrow set of operators and
expressions, restricting their applicability to more complex analytical tasks.
Third--and perhaps most critically--they fail to incorporate design strategies
that enable compute offloading optimized for the characteristics of deep
storage hierarchies. To address these challenges, this paper proposes OASIS, a
novel COS system that features: (i) flexible and interoperable output delivery
through diverse formats, including columnar layouts such as Arrow; (ii) broad
support for complex operators (e.g., aggregate, sort) and array-aware
expressions, including element-wise predicates over array structures; and (iii)
dynamic selection of optimal execution paths across internal storage layers,
guided by operator characteristics and data movement costs. We implemented a
prototype of OASIS and integrated it into the Spark analytics framework.
Through extensive evaluation using real-world scientific queries from HPC
workflows, OASIS achieves up to a 32.7% performance improvement over Spark
configured with existing COS-based storage systems.

Existing LLM serving engines optimize indi- vidual calls in isolation, while
multi-agent frameworks focus on orchestration without system-level performance
planning. As a result, repeated prompts, overlapping contexts, and concurrent
ex- ecutions create substantial redundancy and poor GPU utilization, especially
in batch analytics scenarios. We introduce Halo, a system that brings batch
query processing and optimization into agentic LLM workflows. Halo represents
each workflow as a structured query plan DAG and constructs a consoli- dated
graph for batched queries that exposes shared computation. Guided by a cost
model that jointly considers prefill and decode costs, cache reuse, and GPU
placement, Halo performs plan-level op- timization to minimize redundant
execution. Its runtime integrates adaptive batching, KV-cache sharing and
migration, along with compute-communication overlap to maximize hardware
efficiency. Evaluation across six benchmarks shows that Halo achieves up to
18.6x speedup for batch inference and 4.7x throughput im- provement under
online serving, scaling to workloads of tens of thousands of queries and
complex graphs. These gains are achieved without compromising output quality.
By unifying query optimiza- tion with LLM serving, Halo enables efficient
agentic workflows in data analytics and decision-making applications.

### [952] [Disentangling the schema turn: Restoring the information base to conceptual modelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01617)
*Chris Partridge,Andrew Mitchell,Sergio de Cesare,Oscar Xiberta Soto*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: The paper critiques the prevailing schema-centric approach in conceptual modeling and suggests broader, inclusive practices enabled by modern technology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the widespread reliance on schema-only perspectives in conceptual modeling.

Method: It examines the history of the schema turn and proposes inclusive approaches using pipeline-based conceptual modeling techniques.

Result: The study suggests that modern methodologies, such as bCLEARer, can transcend schema-centric practices.

Conclusion: The schema-centric approach might be a temporary phase, and future practices could integrate schemas and information databases more inclusively.

Abstract: If one looks at contemporary mainstream development practices for conceptual
modelling in computer science, these so clearly focus on a conceptual schema
completely separated from its information base that the conceptual schema is
often just called the conceptual model. These schema-centric practices are
crystallized in almost every database textbook. We call this strong, almost
universal, bias towards conceptual schemas the schema turn. The focus of this
paper is on disentangling this turn within (computer science) conceptual
modeling. It aims to shed some light on how it emerged and so show that it is
not fundamental. To show that modern technology enables the adoption of an
inclusive schema-and-base conceptual modelling approach, which in turn enables
more automated, and empirically motivated practices. And to show, more
generally, the space of possible conceptual modelling practices is wider than
currently assumed. It also uses the example of bCLEARer to show that the
implementations in this wider space will probably need to rely on new
pipeline-based conceptual modelling techniques. So, it is possible that the
schema turn's complete exclusion of the information base could be merely a
temporary evolutionary detour.

*Changjae Lee,Zhuoyue Zhao,Jinjun Xiong*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: The paper introduces SABER, a unified semantic algebra for semantic data processing systems (SDPSs), providing a foundation for queries against unstructured documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semantic data processing systems lack a unified algebraic foundation, leading to difficulties in query composition, reasoning, and optimization.

Method: The authors propose SABER, a semantic algebra based on Extended Relational Algebra, and implement it in a SQL-compatible syntax to support mixed structured/unstructured data queries.

Result: SABER facilitates logical plan construction, optimization, and correctness guarantees while enabling integration with various SDPSs to mix and match operators.

Conclusion: SABER establishes a unified interface for SDPSs, enhancing query processing capabilities and enabling community-driven contributions.

Abstract: The emergence of large-language models (LLMs) has enabled a new class of
semantic data processing systems (SDPSs) to support declarative queries against
unstructured documents. Existing SDPSs are, however, lacking a unified
algebraic foundation, making their queries difficult to compose, reason, and
optimize. We propose a new semantic algebra, SABER (Semantic Algebra Based on
Extended Relational algebra), opening the possibility of semantic operations'
logical plan construction, optimization, and formal correctness guarantees. We
further propose to implement SABER in a SQL-compatible syntax so that it
natively supports mixed structured/unstructured data processing. With SABER, we
showcase the feasibility of providing a unified interface for existing SDPSs so
that it can effectively mix and match any semantically-compatible operator
implementation from any SDPS, greatly enhancing SABER's applicability for
community contributions.

*Fuheng Zhao,Jiayue Chen,Yiming Pan,Tahseen Rabbani,Divyakant Agrawal,Amr El Abbadi*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: The LLM ORDER BY operator is introduced with three innovative methods to address optimality challenges in query processing using LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient query ordering in data systems using LLMs lacks a universally optimal method, necessitating novel approaches to improve accuracy and efficiency.

Method: Three new approaches were introduced: an agreement-based batch-size policy, a majority voting mechanism for pairwise sorting, and a two-way external merge sort.

Result: The agreement-based policy optimizes batch sizes, majority voting improves pairwise comparison accuracy, and external merge sort balances accuracy and efficiency. Clear scaling patterns emerge between compute costs and ordering quality.

Conclusion: These methods advance the use of LLMs in data systems and pave the way for cost modeling for ORDER BY operations leveraging LLMs.

Abstract: We present the LLM ORDER BY operator as a logical abstraction and study its
physical implementations within a unified evaluation framework. Our experiments
show that no single approach is universally optimal, with effectiveness
depending on query characteristics and data. We introduce three new designs: an
agreement-based batch-size policy, a majority voting mechanism for pairwise
sorting, and a two-way external merge sort adapted for LLMs. With extensive
experiments, our agreement-based procedure is effective at determining batch
size for value-based methods, the majority-voting mechanism consistently
strengthens pairwise comparisons on GPT-4o, and external merge sort achieves
high accuracy-efficiency trade-offs across datasets and models. We further
observe a log-linear scaling between compute cost and ordering quality,
offering the first step toward principled cost models for LLM powered data
systems.

*Aryan Poduri,Yashwant Tailor*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: SmartDiff is a system for reliable data differencing across files, databases, and outputs, overcoming schema drift and heterogeneous data types with high precision, faster execution, and reduced memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges like schema drift, heterogeneous data types, and limited explainability in data engineering workflows requiring robust differencing.

Method: SmartDiff uses schema-aware mapping, type-specific comparators, parallel execution, and an LLM-assisted labeling pipeline incorporating retrieval augmentation and constrained decoding.

Result: SmartDiff achieves over 95% precision and recall, outperforms baselines in speed (30-40% faster) and memory (30-50% less), and significantly reduces root-cause analysis time from 10 hours to 12 minutes.

Conclusion: SmartDiff is effective for tasks such as migration validation, regression testing, compliance auditing, and continuous data quality monitoring, showcasing its utility in big data contexts.

Abstract: Data engineering workflows require reliable differencing across files,
databases, and query outputs, yet existing tools falter under schema drift,
heterogeneous types, and limited explainability. SmartDiff is a unified system
that combines schema-aware mapping, type-specific comparators, and parallel
execution. It aligns evolving schemas, compares structured and semi-structured
data (strings, numbers, dates, JSON/XML), and clusters results with labels that
explain how and why differences occur. On multi-million-row datasets, SmartDiff
achieves over 95 percent precision and recall, runs 30 to 40 percent faster,
and uses 30 to 50 percent less memory than baselines; in user studies, it
reduces root-cause analysis time from 10 hours to 12 minutes. An LLM-assisted
labeling pipeline produces deterministic, schema-valid multilabel explanations
using retrieval augmentation and constrained decoding; ablations show further
gains in label accuracy and time to diagnosis over rules-only baselines. These
results indicate SmartDiff's utility for migration validation, regression
testing, compliance auditing, and continuous data quality monitoring. Index

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'SQL-of-Thought,' a multi-agent framework for converting natural language to SQL by breaking down the task into stages and incorporating guided correction based on error taxonomy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve accessibility and usability of databases through natural language interfaces and address the challenges in current Text-to-SQL systems.

Method: The SQL-of-Thought framework uses in-context learning and a chain-of-thought process, combined with task decomposition into steps like schema linking, subproblem identification, and guided correction for error handling.

Result: The proposed system achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Spider dataset and its variants.

Conclusion: By integrating dynamic error correction with reasoning-oriented approaches, SQL-of-Thought establishes a robust and effective method for Text-to-SQL tasks.

Abstract: Converting natural language queries into SQL queries is a crucial challenge
in both industry and academia, aiming to increase access to databases and
large-scale applications. This work examines how in-context learning and
chain-of-thought can be utilized to develop a robust solution for text-to-SQL
systems. We propose SQL-of-Thought: a multi-agent framework that decomposes the
Text2SQL task into schema linking, subproblem identification, query plan
generation, SQL generation, and a guided correction loop. Unlike prior systems
that rely only on execution-based static correction, we introduce
taxonomy-guided dynamic error modification informed by in-context learning.
SQL-of-Thought achieves state-of-the-art results on the Spider dataset and its
variants, combining guided error taxonomy with reasoning-based query planning.

*Sarayu Sirikonda,Jasper van de Kreeke*

Main category: math.RA

TL;DR: The paper presents a hybrid approach combining deterministic methods and machine learning (Random Forest Classifier) to restore corrupted finite semigroups, achieving higher repair rates than standalone methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Corruption in finite semigroups disrupts associativity and invalidates algebraic structures. Deterministic strategies are insufficient for higher cardinality or corruption levels, necessitating improved repair methods.

Method: A hybrid framework integrates deterministic repair strategies with a Random Forest Classifier to handle corrupted finite semigroups. Experiments were conducted using data sets generated by Mace4.

Result: The framework healed 95% of semigroups at cardinality n=6 and 60% at n=10 for a corruption rate of p=15%, outperforming deterministic-only and ML-only approaches.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach successfully addresses the limitations of deterministic and ML-only methods, providing better healing rates for corrupted semigroups at varying degrees of cardinality and corruption.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a hybrid framework that heals corrupted finite
semigroups, combining deterministic repair strategies with Machine Learning
using a Random Forest Classifier. Corruption in these tables breaks
associativity and invalidates the algebraic structure. Deterministic methods
work for small cardinality n and low corruption but degrade rapidly. Our
experiments, carried out on Mace4-generated data sets, demonstrate that our
hybrid framework achieves higher healing rates than deterministic-only and
ML-only baselines. At a corruption percentage of p=15%, our framework healed
95% of semigroups up to cardinality n=6 and 60% at n=10.

*Matej Steinbacher,Mitja Steinbacher,Matjaz Steinbacher*

Main category: q-fin.TR

TL;DR: The study reveals how sequential order book processing in artificial stock markets biases asset price dynamics, emphasizing the importance of clearing mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand how different clearing mechanisms influence multi-asset price dynamics in artificial stock markets.

Method: Analyzed sequential order book processing and its effects on capital allocation, asset demand, and price trajectories.

Result: Sequential processing biases asset demand and prices due to preferential access to funds for assets processed earlier.

Conclusion: Clearing mechanisms are crucial for accurately modeling financial behavior in artificial markets.

Abstract: This study examines the impact of different computing implementations of
clearing mechanisms on multi-asset price dynamics within an artificial stock
market framework. We show that sequential processing of order books introduces
a systematic and significant bias by affecting the allocation of traders'
capital within a single time step. This occurs because applying budget
constraints sequentially grants assets processed earlier preferential access to
funds, distorting individual asset demand and consequently their price
trajectories. The findings highlight that while the overall price level is
primarily driven by macro factors like the money-to-stock ratio, the market's
microstructural clearing mechanism plays a critical role in the allocation of
value among individual assets. This underscores the necessity for careful
consideration and validation of clearing mechanisms in artificial markets to
accurately model complex financial behaviors.

*Nicholas J. Sullivan,Julio J. Valdés,Kirk H. Bevan,Peter Grutter*

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR: The paper proposes an automation framework for scanning probe microscopes (SPMs) to improve code sharing and reusability, validated using multiple SPMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SPM experiments are hindered by their time-consuming nature and the complexity of required domain knowledge. While automation offers benefits, existing systems lack adaptability across various SPMs.

Method: The authors developed a framework defining generic control and data schemas passed among software components, with SPM commands translated via SPM-specific translators. This supports multi-language functionality and allows component decoupling across computers.

Result: The framework was successfully integrated with two SPMs from different manufacturers, and validated using a thermal drift correction experiment.

Conclusion: This framework facilitates code sharing and reusability in SPM automation, enhancing experimental efficiency and usability across diverse SPM systems.

Abstract: Scanning probe microscopy (SPM) is a valuable technique by which one can
investigate the physical characteristics of the surfaces of materials. However,
its widespread use is hampered by the time-consuming nature of running an
experiment and the significant domain knowledge required. Recent studies have
shown the value of multiple forms of automation in improving this, but their
use is limited due to the difficulty of integrating them with SPMs other than
the one it was developed for. With this in mind, we propose an automation
framework for SPMs aimed toward facilitating code sharing and reusability of
developed components. Our framework defines generic control and data structure
schemas which are passed among independent software processes (components),
with the final SPM commands sent after passing through an SPM-specific
translator. This approach permits multi-language support and allows for
experimental components to be decoupled among multiple computers. Our mediation
logic limits access to the SPM to a single component at a time, with a simple
override mechanism in order to correct detected experiment problems. To
validate our proposal, we integrated and tested it with two SPMs from separate
manufacturers, and ran an experiment involving a thermal drift correction
component.

### [960] [BOLT: Bandwidth-Optimized Lightning-Fast Oblivious Map powered by Secure HBM Accelerators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01742)
*Yitong Guo,Hongbo Chen,Haobin Hiroki Chen,Yukui Luo,XiaoFeng Wang,Chenghong Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) are secure but suffer from access pattern leaks. The paper introduces BOLT, an OMAP accelerator for TEEs leveraging High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM) to reduce overhead while enhancing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Access pattern leakages in TEEs pose security risks despite their strong secure computing foundation. Existing solutions like OMAPs are secure but inefficient. Advances in HBM provide an opportunity for improved performance while maintaining security.

Method: The authors propose "BOLT," an OMAP accelerator. It uses HBM as an unobservable cache, introduces a self-hosted architecture to prevent CPU leakage, and employs co-designed algorithms and architecture. BOLT is implemented on a Xilinx U55C FPGA.

Result: BOLT achieves significant performance gains, with up to 279x improvement in initialization time and 480x in query time compared to existing OMAP implementations, including one by Facebook.

Conclusion: BOLT demonstrates that leveraging HBM and tailored designs can significantly improve the performance and security of OMAPs, offering a practical and efficient solution for TEEs.

Abstract: While Trusted Execution Environments provide a strong foundation for secure
cloud computing, they remain vulnerable to access pattern leakages. Oblivious
Maps (OMAPs) mitigate this by fully hiding access patterns but suffer from high
overhead due to randomized remapping and worst-case padding. We argue these
costs are not fundamental. Modern accelerators featuring High-Bandwidth Memory
(HBM) offer a new opportunity: Vaswani et al. [OSDI'18] point out that
eavesdropping on HBM is difficult -- even for physical attackers -- as its
memory channels are sealed together with processor cores inside the same
physical package. Later, Hunt et al. [NSDI'20] show that, with proper
isolation, HBM can be turned into an unobservable region where both data and
memory traces are hidden. This motivates a rethink of OMAP design with
HBM-backed solutions to finally overcome their traditional performance limits.
Building on these insights, we present BOLT, a Bandwidth Optimized,
Lightning-fast OMAP accelerator that, for the first time, achieves O(1) +
O((log log N)^2) bandwidth overhead. BOLT introduces three key innovations: (i)
a new OMAP algorithm that leverages isolated HBM as an unobservable cache to
accelerate oblivious access to large host memory; (ii) a self-hosted
architecture that offloads execution and memory control from the host to
mitigate CPU-side leakage; and (iii) tailored algorithm-architecture co-designs
that maximize resource efficiency. We implement a prototype BOLT on a Xilinx
U55C FPGA. Evaluations show that BOLT achieves up to 279x and 480x speedups in
initialization and query time, respectively, over state-of-the-art OMAPs,
including an industry implementation from Facebook.

### [961] [Federated Survival Analysis with Node-Level Differential Privacy: Private Kaplan-Meier Curves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00615)
*Narasimha Raghavan Veeraragavan,Jan Franz Nygård*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to compute Kaplan-Meier survival curves while preserving patient privacy using differential privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to allow multiple healthcare jurisdictions to share survival curve data securely and privately without compromising patient privacy.

Method: The method involves adding Laplace noise to individual site survival curves, averaging them, and using smoothing techniques such as Total-Variation denoising, Discrete Cosine Transform, Haar Wavelet shrinkage, and a parametric Weibull fit.

Result: Total-Variation denoising offers the best mean accuracy, while frequency-domain smoothers ensure robustness and Weibull model stability in strict privacy conditions. The empirical log-rank type-I error remains below 15% for privacy budgets of 0.5 or higher.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that survival data can be securely shared without iterative computation or complex cryptographic techniques, preserving both privacy and clinical utility.

Abstract: We investigate how to calculate Kaplan-Meier survival curves across multiple
health-care jurisdictions while protecting patient privacy with node-level
differential privacy. Each site discloses its curve only once, adding Laplace
noise whose scale is determined by the length of the common time grid; the
server then averages the noisy curves, so the overall privacy budget remains
unchanged. We benchmark four one-shot smoothing techniques: Discrete Cosine
Transform, Haar Wavelet shrinkage, adaptive Total-Variation denoising, and a
parametric Weibull fit on the NCCTG lung-cancer cohort under five privacy
levels and three partition scenarios (uniform, moderately skewed, highly
imbalanced). Total-Variation gives the best mean accuracy, whereas the
frequency-domain smoothers offer stronger worst-case robustness and the Weibull
model shows the most stable behaviour at the strictest privacy setting. Across
all methods the released curves keep the empirical log-rank type-I error below
fifteen percent for privacy budgets of 0.5 and higher, demonstrating that
clinically useful survival information can be shared without iterative training
or heavy cryptography.

*Handi Chen,Jing Deng,Xiuzhe Wu,Zhihan Jiang,Xinchen Zhang,Xianhao Chen,Edith C. H. Ngai*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: LiFeChain is a lightweight blockchain designed to enhance Federated Lifelong Learning (FLL) by ensuring secure, efficient, and tamper-resistant systems, addressing scalability, privacy, and security issues in IoT environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The integration of IoT and FLL faces vulnerabilities such as persistent attacks and performance degradation due to data heterogeneity. Current single-server architectures and straightforward blockchain implementations fail to provide a balance between security, efficiency, and scalability.

Method: LiFeChain incorporates a tamper-resistant, lightweight blockchain with two complementary mechanisms: proof-of-model-correlation (PoMC) consensus for efficient long-term learning and unlearning, and segmented zero-knowledge arbitration (Seg-ZA) for privacy-preserving anomaly detection and arbitration.

Result: Experimental results validate LiFeChain's ability to improve model performance against two specific long-term attack patterns while maintaining high efficiency and scalability.

Conclusion: LiFeChain establishes a tamper-proof, scalable, and efficient framework for FLL in IoT systems, making it a practical and innovative tool to overcome security and heterogeneity challenges.

Abstract: The expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) devices constantly generates
heterogeneous data streams, driving demand for continuous, decentralized
intelligence. Federated Lifelong Learning (FLL) provides an ideal solution by
incorporating federated and lifelong learning to overcome catastrophic
forgetting. The extended lifecycle of FLL in IoT systems increases their
vulnerability to persistent attacks, and these risks may be obscured by
performance degradation caused by spatial-temporal data heterogeneity.
Moreover, this problem is exacerbated by the standard single-server
architecture, as its single point of failure makes it difficult to maintain a
reliable audit trail for long-term threats. Blockchain provides a tamper-proof
foundation for trustworthy FLL systems. Nevertheless, directly applying
blockchain to FLL significantly increases computational and retrieval costs
with the expansion of the knowledge base, slowing down the training on IoT
devices. To address these challenges, we propose LiFeChain, a lightweight
blockchain for secure and efficient federated lifelong learning by providing a
tamper-resistant ledger with minimal on-chain disclosure and bidirectional
verification. To the best of our knowledge, LiFeChain is the first blockchain
tailored for FLL. LiFeChain incorporates two complementary mechanisms: the
proof-of-model-correlation (PoMC) consensus on the server, which couples
learning and unlearning mechanisms to mitigate negative transfer, and segmented
zero-knowledge arbitration (Seg-ZA) on the client, which detects and arbitrates
abnormal committee behavior without compromising privacy. LiFeChain is designed
as a plug-and-play component that can be seamlessly integrated into existing
FLL algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that LiFeChain not only
enhances model performance against two long-term attacks but also sustains high
efficiency and scalability.

*Zhiyang Chen,Tara Saba,Xun Deng,Xujie Si,Fan Long*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper investigates the security risks posed by large language models (LLMs) producing malicious content, finding that 4.2% of generated programs contain harmful URLs, likely due to poisoned training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the security risks of LLMs absorbing malicious training data from internet datasets and unintentionally generating harmful outputs.

Method: The researchers developed a scalable, automated audit framework to create benign-looking prompts from scam databases, which were used to query four production LLMs and assess their responses.

Result: All tested LLMs were found to generate malicious code at a non-negligible rate, with 4.2% of outputs containing harmful URLs even when prompted innocuously. A total of 177 validated prompts consistently triggered similar harmful outputs across models.

Conclusion: The findings indicate systemic vulnerabilities in LLM training pipelines, emphasizing the need for better defense mechanisms, including improved safety checks during and after content generation, to prevent security threats.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become critical to modern software
development, but their reliance on internet datasets for training introduces a
significant security risk: the absorption and reproduction of malicious
content. To evaluate this threat, this paper introduces a scalable, automated
audit framework that synthesizes innocuous, developer-style prompts from known
scam databases to query production LLMs and determine if they generate code
containing harmful URLs. We conducted a large-scale evaluation across four
production LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Llama-4-Scout, and DeepSeek-V3), and
found a systemic vulnerability, with all tested models generating malicious
code at a non-negligible rate. On average, 4.2\% of programs generated in our
experiments contained malicious URLs. Crucially, this malicious code is often
generated in response to benign prompts. We manually validate the prompts which
cause all four LLMs to generate malicious code, and resulting in 177 innocuous
prompts that trigger all models to produce harmful outputs. These results
provide strong empirical evidence that the training data of production LLMs has
been successfully poisoned at scale, underscoring the urgent need for more
robust defense mechanisms and post-generation safety checks to mitigate the
propagation of hidden security threats.

### [964] [Per-sender neural network classifiers for email authorship validation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00005)
*Rohit Dube*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel defense method, authorship validation, to counter internal email phishing by validating if the claimed sender authored the email. It introduces datasets simulating inauthentic emails and evaluates models for the task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Organizations face significant threats from phishing attacks originating from compromised employee accounts, and existing defenses often overlook internal emails. This paper aims to fill the security gap.

Method: The paper introduces authorship validation, using per-sender writing style analysis, and tests it on datasets that replicate inauthentic messages using human-written and AI-generated emails. Two classifiers, Naive Bayes and Char-CNN, are evaluated.

Result: The experiments show that the Char-CNN classifier consistently delivers high accuracy and F1 scores for authorship validation across different scenarios.

Conclusion: Authorship validation proves to be a lightweight and practical method for identifying phishing emails from compromised accounts. It can integrate easily into commercial email security systems with low overhead.

Abstract: Business email compromise and lateral spear phishing attacks are among modern
organizations' most costly and damaging threats. While inbound phishing
defenses have improved significantly, most organizations still trust internal
emails by default, leaving themselves vulnerable to attacks from compromised
employee accounts. In this work, we define and explore the problem of
authorship validation: verifying whether a claimed sender actually authored a
given email. Authorship validation is a lightweight, real-time defense that
complements traditional detection methods by modeling per-sender writing style.
Further, the paper presents a collection of new datasets based on the Enron
corpus. These simulate inauthentic messages using both human-written and large
language model-generated emails. The paper also evaluates two classifiers -- a
Naive Bayes model and a character-level convolutional neural network (Char-CNN)
-- for the authorship validation task. Our experiments show that the Char-CNN
model achieves high accuracy and F1 scores under various circumstances.
Finally, we discuss deployment considerations and show that per-sender
authorship classifiers are practical for integrating into existing commercial
email security systems with low overhead.

*Luca Cotti,Anisa Rula,Devis Bianchini,Federico Cerutti*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a methodology combining domain ontologies with Large Language Models to enhance information extraction and accuracy from cybersecurity logs, organizing the data into a semantic graph database.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve reliable and transparent identification of malicious events in cybersecurity system logs, particularly in unstructured or ambiguous cases.

Method: Combines ontology-driven structured outputs and SHACL-based constraints into an AI agent incorporating LLMs for accurate and explainable extraction. Information is organized in a semantic graph database.

Result: Achieves higher accuracy in information extraction than traditional prompt-based methods, based on experimental evaluation using public datasets.

Conclusion: The approach effectively improves extraction quality and explainability, aligning extracted data with structured and semantically valid formats.

Abstract: Effective Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) relies upon accurately structured
and semantically enriched information extracted from cybersecurity system logs.
However, current methodologies often struggle to identify and interpret
malicious events reliably and transparently, particularly in cases involving
unstructured or ambiguous log entries. In this work, we propose a novel
methodology that combines ontology-driven structured outputs with Large
Language Models (LLMs), to build an Artificial Intelligence (AI) agent that
improves the accuracy and explainability of information extraction from
cybersecurity logs. Central to our approach is the integration of domain
ontologies and SHACL-based constraints to guide the language model's output
structure and enforce semantic validity over the resulting graph. Extracted
information is organized into an ontology-enriched graph database, enabling
future semantic analysis and querying. The design of our methodology is
motivated by the analytical requirements associated with honeypot log data,
which typically comprises predominantly malicious activity. While our case
study illustrates the relevance of this scenario, the experimental evaluation
is conducted using publicly available datasets. Results demonstrate that our
method achieves higher accuracy in information extraction compared to
traditional prompt-only approaches, with a deliberate focus on extraction
quality rather than processing speed.

Motivation: The societal dependence on AI demands frameworks to ensure the security, accountability, and trustworthiness of these systems.

Method: It integrates privacy via zero-knowledge cryptography, secure computation, and enhanced delegation mechanisms to address privacy and verifiability challenges.

Result: Novel techniques are proposed for deploying auditable and confidential AI systems, balancing technical advancements with policy discussions.

Conclusion: The work offers practical solutions and cohesive perspectives for responsible AI development, benefiting system designers and policymaking.

Abstract: The growing societal reliance on artificial intelligence necessitates robust
frameworks for ensuring its security, accountability, and trustworthiness. This
thesis addresses the complex interplay between privacy, verifiability, and
auditability in modern AI, particularly in foundation models. It argues that
technical solutions that integrate these elements are critical for responsible

Specifically, the research introduces techniques for enabling verifiable and

### [967] [AEGIS : Automated Co-Evolutionary Framework for Guarding Prompt Injections Schema](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00088)
*Ting-Chun Liu,Ching-Yu Hsu,Kuan-Yi Lee,Chi-An Fu,Hung-yi Lee*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces AEGIS, an automated co-evolutionary framework to defend against prompt injection attacks on Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework optimizes both attack and defense prompts iteratively using text-based gradient optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual prompt engineering has limited the performance of prompt-based detection methods for addressing prompt injection attacks in LLMs.

Method: AEGIS employs a co-evolutionary framework where attack and defense prompts evolve together through Textual Gradient Optimization (TGO). Feedback is provided via a LLM-guided evaluation loop.

Result: AEGIS outperforms existing baselines in robustness. Attack success rate (ASR) reaches 1.0 (+0.26 over baseline), true positive rate (TPR) improves by 0.23, and true negative rate (TNR) remains at 0.89.

Conclusion: The proposed framework leverages adversarial training to achieve scalable and effective defenses against prompt injection attacks in various LLMs.

Abstract: Prompt injection attacks pose a significant challenge to the safe deployment
of Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications. While prompt-based
detection offers a lightweight and interpretable defense strategy, its
effectiveness has been hindered by the need for manual prompt engineering. To
address this issue, we propose AEGIS , an Automated co-Evolutionary framework
for Guarding prompt Injections Schema. Both attack and defense prompts are
iteratively optimized against each other using a gradient-like natural language
prompt optimization technique. This framework enables both attackers and
defenders to autonomously evolve via a Textual Gradient Optimization (TGO)
module, leveraging feedback from an LLM-guided evaluation loop. We evaluate our
system on a real-world assignment grading dataset of prompt injection attacks
and demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing baselines,
achieving superior robustness in both attack success and detection.
Specifically, the attack success rate (ASR) reaches 1.0, representing an
improvement of 0.26 over the baseline. For detection, the true positive rate
(TPR) improves by 0.23 compared to the previous best work, reaching 0.84, and
the true negative rate (TNR) remains comparable at 0.89. Ablation studies
confirm the importance of co-evolution, gradient buffering, and multi-objective
optimization. We also confirm that this framework is effective in different
LLMs. Our results highlight the promise of adversarial training as a scalable
and effective approach for guarding prompt injections.

*Shaked Zychlinski*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper identifies a new security threat where malicious websites exploit the identifiable digital fingerprints of autonomous web-browsing agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) to serve cloaked malicious content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Web-browsing agents powered by LLMs are becoming increasingly common, but their distinctive fingerprints (browser attributes, automation frameworks, etc.) make them vulnerable to targeted exploitation.

Method: The authors introduce a method where malicious websites detect LLM-based agents through fingerprinting techniques and serve cloaked content tailored to attack the agent by embedding malicious, hidden instructions.

Result: The attack enables adversaries to manipulate LLM agents into performing harmful actions like data theft, misinformation dissemination, and malware execution without detection by human users or conventional security systems.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes the significant security risks posed by agent fingerprinting and cloaking, calling for immediate development of countermeasures to protect these evolving AI agents from stealthy attacks.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel attack vector that leverages website cloaking
techniques to compromise autonomous web-browsing agents powered by Large
Language Models (LLMs). As these agents become more prevalent, their unique and
often homogenous digital fingerprints - comprising browser attributes,
automation framework signatures, and network characteristics - create a new,
distinguishable class of web traffic. The attack exploits this
fingerprintability. A malicious website can identify an incoming request as
originating from an AI agent and dynamically serve a different, "cloaked"
version of its content. While human users see a benign webpage, the agent is
presented with a visually identical page embedded with hidden, malicious
instructions, such as indirect prompt injections. This mechanism allows
adversaries to hijack agent behavior, leading to data exfiltration, malware
execution, or misinformation propagation, all while remaining completely
invisible to human users and conventional security crawlers. This work
formalizes the threat model, details the mechanics of agent fingerprinting and
cloaking, and discusses the profound security implications for the future of
agentic AI, highlighting the urgent need for robust defenses against this
stealthy and scalable attack.

*Omar Khalid Ali Mohamed*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a lightweight malware detection framework using probability-level fusion across three datasets to improve cross-domain generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models struggle with cross-domain generalization and high computational costs for malware detection.

Method: Individual LightGBM classifiers are trained on three distinct datasets, and prediction probabilities are fused using optimized weights via grid search.

Result: The framework achieves a macro F1-score of 0.823 on cross-domain validation, outperforming individual models and demonstrating strong generalization.

Conclusion: The proposed malware detection framework is efficient, generalizes well across domains, and is suitable for real-time deployment with reproducible code and data.

Abstract: The escalating sophistication of malware necessitates robust detection
mechanisms that generalize across diverse data sources. Traditional
single-dataset models struggle with cross-domain generalization and often incur
high computational costs. This paper presents a novel, lightweight framework
for malware detection that employs probability-level fusion across three
distinct datasets: EMBER (static features), API Call Sequences (behavioral
features), and CIC Obfuscated Memory (memory patterns). Our method trains
individual LightGBM classifiers on each dataset, selects top predictive
features to ensure efficiency, and fuses their prediction probabilities using
optimized weights determined via grid search. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our fusion approach achieves a macro F1-score of 0.823 on a cross-domain
validation set, significantly outperforming individual models and providing
superior generalization. The framework maintains low computational overhead,
making it suitable for real-time deployment, and all code and data are provided
for full reproducibility.

### [970] [Enabling Trustworthy Federated Learning via Remote Attestation for Mitigating Byzantine Threats](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00634)
*Chaoyu Zhang,Heng Jin,Shanghao Shi,Hexuan Yu,Sydney Johns,Y. Thomas Hou,Wenjing Lou*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Sentinel, a system for Federated Learning (FL) designed to protect against Byzantine attacks using remote attestation for enhanced transparency and security.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FL faces challenges from Byzantine attacks due to its reliance on local training updates, making it susceptible to malicious participants. Existing defenses struggle to distinguish malicious updates from benign variations caused by factors like non-IID data.

Method: The proposed method, Sentinel, employs code instrumentation and Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to monitor and attest the integrity of the local training process. An attestation report, cryptographically signed, is sent to the server to validate updates.

Result: Sentinel demonstrated effective detection of Byzantine attacks while maintaining low runtime and memory overhead in experiments on IoT devices.

Conclusion: Sentinel enhances the security and reliability of FL systems by ensuring only trusted model updates contribute to the global model, addressing critical vulnerabilities against malicious behavior.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has gained significant attention for its
privacy-preserving capabilities, enabling distributed devices to
collaboratively train a global model without sharing raw data. However, its
distributed nature forces the central server to blindly trust the local
training process and aggregate uncertain model updates, making it susceptible
to Byzantine attacks from malicious participants, especially in
mission-critical scenarios. Detecting such attacks is challenging due to the
diverse knowledge across clients, where variations in model updates may stem
from benign factors, such as non-IID data, rather than adversarial behavior.
Existing data-driven defenses struggle to distinguish malicious updates from
natural variations, leading to high false positive rates and poor filtering
performance.
  To address this challenge, we propose Sentinel, a remote attestation
(RA)-based scheme for FL systems that regains client-side transparency and
mitigates Byzantine attacks from a system security perspective. Our system
employs code instrumentation to track control-flow and monitor critical
variables in the local training process. Additionally, we utilize a trusted
training recorder within a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to generate an
attestation report, which is cryptographically signed and securely transmitted
to the server. Upon verification, the server ensures that legitimate client
training processes remain free from program behavior violation or data
manipulation, allowing only trusted model updates to be aggregated into the
global model. Experimental results on IoT devices demonstrate that Sentinel
ensures the trustworthiness of the local training integrity with low runtime
and memory overhead.

### [971] [From Attack Descriptions to Vulnerabilities: A Sentence Transformer-Based Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02077)
*Refat Othman,Diaeddin Rimawi,Bruno Rossi,Barbara Russo*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The study automates linking attacks to vulnerabilities using sentence transformers, achieving high classification performance and identifying undocumented links.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manually mapping attacks to vulnerabilities is infeasible, and automation is required to enhance security incident detection and response.

Method: The paper evaluates 14 sentence transformer models to automatically classify vulnerabilities using textual attack descriptions.

Result: The multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1 model achieves the highest performance with an F1-score of 89.0, precision of 84.0, and recall of 94.7.

Conclusion: Automating attack-to-vulnerability mapping improves security incident response and reveals undocumented links, contributing to enhanced system security.

Abstract: In the domain of security, vulnerabilities frequently remain undetected even
after their exploitation. In this work, vulnerabilities refer to publicly
disclosed flaws documented in Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)
reports. Establishing a connection between attacks and vulnerabilities is
essential for enabling timely incident response, as it provides defenders with
immediate, actionable insights. However, manually mapping attacks to CVEs is
infeasible, thereby motivating the need for automation. This paper evaluates 14
state-of-the-art (SOTA) sentence transformers for automatically identifying
vulnerabilities from textual descriptions of attacks. Our results demonstrate
that the multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1 (MMPNet) model achieves superior
classification performance when using attack Technique descriptions, with an
F1-score of 89.0, precision of 84.0, and recall of 94.7. Furthermore, it was
observed that, on average, 56% of the vulnerabilities identified by the MMPNet
model are also represented within the CVE repository in conjunction with an
attack, while 61% of the vulnerabilities detected by the model correspond to
those cataloged in the CVE repository. A manual inspection of the results
revealed the existence of 275 predicted links that were not documented in the
MITRE repositories. Consequently, the automation of linking attack techniques
to vulnerabilities not only enhances the detection and response capabilities
related to software security incidents but also diminishes the duration during
which vulnerabilities remain exploitable, thereby contributing to the
development of more secure systems.

*Yu-Zheng Lin,Sujan Ghimire,Abhiram Nandimandalam,Jonah Michael Camacho,Unnati Tripathi,Rony Macwan,Sicong Shao,Setareh Rafatirad,Rozhin Yasaei,Pratik Satam,Soheil Salehi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The LLM-HyPZ framework is introduced as a scalable and systematic method to detect hardware vulnerabilities using large language models (LLMs) for zero-shot classification and analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With hardware vulnerabilities significantly on the rise and presenting long-term risks, existing efforts are subjective and lack data-driven rigor, necessitating a scalable method for addressing this issue.

Method: The paper proposes LLM-HyPZ, a framework combining zero-shot LLM classification, contextualized embeddings, unsupervised clustering, and prompt-driven summarization. It was applied to a large CVE dataset to identify hardware vulnerabilities.

Result: The framework identified 1,742 hardware-related vulnerabilities and categorized them into five themes. It demonstrated a high classification accuracy (99.5%) with the LLaMA 3.3 70B model and contributed to the MIHW update by reducing manual effort.

Conclusion: LLM-HyPZ establishes itself as the first scalable, data-driven approach for detecting hardware vulnerabilities, efficiently bridging the gap between expert insights and practical vulnerability data.

Abstract: The rapid growth of hardware vulnerabilities has created an urgent need for
systematic and scalable analysis methods. Unlike software flaws, which are
often patchable post-deployment, hardware weaknesses remain embedded across
product lifecycles, posing persistent risks to processors, embedded devices,
and IoT platforms. Existing efforts such as the MITRE CWE Hardware List (2021)
relied on expert-driven Delphi surveys, which lack statistical rigor and
introduce subjective bias, while large-scale data-driven foundations for
hardware weaknesses have been largely absent. In this work, we propose
LLM-HyPZ, an LLM-assisted hybrid framework for zero-shot knowledge extraction
and refinement from vulnerability corpora. Our approach integrates zero-shot
LLM classification, contextualized embeddings, unsupervised clustering, and
prompt-driven summarization to mine hardware-related CVEs at scale. Applying
LLM-HyPZ to the 2021-2024 CVE corpus (114,836 entries), we identified 1,742
hardware-related vulnerabilities. We distilled them into five recurring themes,
including privilege escalation via firmware and BIOS, memory corruption in
mobile and IoT systems, and physical access exploits. Benchmarking across seven
LLMs shows that LLaMA 3.3 70B achieves near-perfect classification accuracy
(99.5%) on a curated validation set. Beyond methodological contributions, our
framework directly supported the MITRE CWE Most Important Hardware Weaknesses
(MIHW) 2025 update by narrowing the candidate search space. Specifically, our
pipeline surfaced 411 of the 1,026 CVEs used for downstream MIHW analysis,
thereby reducing expert workload and accelerating evidence gathering. These
results establish LLM-HyPZ as the first data-driven, scalable approach for
systematically discovering hardware vulnerabilities, thereby bridging the gap
between expert knowledge and real-world vulnerability evidence.

*Kanchon Gharami,Hansaka Aluvihare,Shafika Showkat Moni,Berker Peköz*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to replicate black-box Large Language Models (LLMs) rapidly and efficiently using minimal logit leakage data, highlighting security risks with API-accessible LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this paper is to address the overlooked security vulnerabilities of LLM APIs, especially when they lack strong access controls, thus exposing them to adversarial cloning attacks.

Method: The authors propose a two-stage approach: (i) reconstruct the output projection matrix using top-k logits and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for less than 10k black-box queries; (ii) distill architectures into student models of varying transformer depths trained on open-source datasets.

Result: The replicated models achieved high fidelity to the original: a 6-layer student model recreated 97.6% of the teacher model's geometry with minimal performance loss (7.31% perplexity increase). A smaller 4-layer variant demonstrated efficiency gains with 17.1% faster inference and 18.1% fewer parameters.

Conclusion: The replication method is fast and effective, exposing how vulnerable current LLMs are to cloning attacks. The findings call for stricter security measures on inference APIs, such as hardened access controls and secure on-premise deployments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in mission-critical
systems, facilitating tasks such as satellite operations, command-and-control,
military decision support, and cyber defense. Many of these systems are
accessed through application programming interfaces (APIs). When such APIs lack
robust access controls, they can expose full or top-k logits, creating a
significant and often overlooked attack surface. Prior art has mainly focused
on reconstructing the output projection layer or distilling surface-level
behaviors. However, regenerating a black-box model under tight query
constraints remains underexplored. We address that gap by introducing a
constrained replication pipeline that transforms partial logit leakage into a
functional deployable substitute model clone. Our two-stage approach (i)
reconstructs the output projection matrix by collecting top-k logits from under
10k black-box queries via singular value decomposition (SVD) over the logits,
then (ii) distills the remaining architecture into compact student models with
varying transformer depths, trained on an open source dataset. A 6-layer
student recreates 97.6% of the 6-layer teacher model's hidden-state geometry,
with only a 7.31% perplexity increase, and a 7.58 Negative Log-Likelihood
(NLL). A 4-layer variant achieves 17.1% faster inference and 18.1% parameter
reduction with comparable performance. The entire attack completes in under 24
graphics processing unit (GPU) hours and avoids triggering API rate-limit
defenses. These results demonstrate how quickly a cost-limited adversary can
clone an LLM, underscoring the urgent need for hardened inference APIs and
secure on-premise defense deployments.

*Dezhang Kong,Hujin Peng,Yilun Zhang,Lele Zhao,Zhenhua Xu,Shi Lin,Changting Lin,Meng Han*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel type of security attack, 'Web Fraud Attacks,' targeting LLM-driven multi-agent systems (MAS) by exploiting vulnerabilities in link validation to induce visits to malicious websites.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Highlight the security risks posed by the proliferation of LLM-driven MAS, focusing on malicious website-induced attacks that could drastically expand the attack surface.

Method: Designed 11 representative attack variants using techniques like domain name tampering, link structure camouflage, and other deceptive approaches to exploit MAS's link validation vulnerabilities.

Result: Experiments demonstrated significant destructive potential and evasion advantages of Web fraud attacks across diverse MAS architectures.

Conclusion: Web fraud attacks represent a critical threat due to their stealthiness and destructive capabilities, necessitating urgent focus on security measures in LLM-driven MAS.

Abstract: With the proliferation of applications built upon LLM-driven multi-agent
systems (MAS), the security of Web links has become a critical concern in
ensuring system reliability. Once an agent is induced to visit a malicious
website, attackers can use it as a springboard to conduct diverse subsequent
attacks, which will drastically expand the attack surface. In this paper, we
propose Web Fraud Attacks, a novel type of attack aiming at inducing MAS to
visit malicious websites. We design 11 representative attack variants that
encompass domain name tampering (homoglyph deception, character substitution,
etc.), link structure camouflage (sub-directory nesting, sub-domain grafting,
parameter obfuscation, etc.), and other deceptive techniques tailored to
exploit MAS's vulnerabilities in link validation. Through extensive experiments
on these crafted attack vectors, we demonstrate that Web fraud attacks not only
exhibit significant destructive potential across different MAS architectures
but also possess a distinct advantage in evasion: they circumvent the need for
complex input formats such as jailbreaking, which inherently carry higher
exposure risks. These results underscore the importance of addressing Web fraud
attacks in LLM-driven MAS, as their stealthiness and destructiveness pose
non-negligible threats to system security and user safety.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces an unsupervised machine learning anomaly detection model for network flows that adapts dynamically, achieving high accuracy and low false positive rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for adaptive solutions in network traffic monitoring due to increasing traffic volumes and sophisticated attacks, along with the challenge of scarce labeled data.

Method: Utilized online learning with a One-Class SVM implemented with the River library. The model was trained and evaluated using NF-UNSW-NB15 and its extended v2 datasets.

Result: Achieved over 98% accuracy, a false positive rate under 3.1%, and 100% recall using the v2 dataset, with processing time per flow under 0.033 ms.

Conclusion: The proposed model is highly effective and feasible for real-time anomaly detection in dynamic network environments.

Abstract: Nowadays, the volume of network traffic continues to grow, along with the
frequency and sophistication of attacks. This scenario highlights the need for
solutions capable of continuously adapting, since network behavior is dynamic
and changes over time. This work presents an anomaly detection model for
network flows using unsupervised machine learning with online learning
capabilities. This approach allows the system to dynamically learn the normal
behavior of the network and detect deviations without requiring labeled data,
which is particularly useful in real-world environments where traffic is
constantly changing and labeled data is scarce. The model was implemented using
the River library with a One-Class SVM and evaluated on the NF-UNSW-NB15
dataset and its extended version v2, which contain network flows labeled with
different attack categories. The results show an accuracy above 98%, a false
positive rate below 3.1%, and a recall of 100% in the most advanced version of
the dataset. In addition, the low processing time per flow (<0.033 ms)
demonstrates the feasibility of the approach for real-time applications.

TL;DR: The paper addresses cybersecurity threats to Radiation Detection Systems and proposes a resource-efficient Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using TinyML techniques with an optimized XGBoost model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the growing cyber-attack vulnerabilities in Radiation Detection Systems, which could jeopardize public safety and health by compromising the integrity of critical radiation measurements.

Method: The paper introduces an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) designed for low-resource devices. It leverages TinyML techniques like pruning, quantization, feature selection, and sampling, applied to an optimized XGBoost model, enabling real-time intrusion detection under resource constraints.

Result: The optimized IDS achieves real-time intrusion detection on resource-constrained hardware while balancing efficiency and accuracy.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates a practical solution for enhancing cybersecurity of critical infrastructure by bringing ML-driven intrusion detection closer to sensing edge layers, ensuring safety and reliability through resource-aware optimization techniques.

Abstract: Radiation Detection Systems (RDSs) play a vital role in ensuring public
safety across various settings, from nuclear facilities to medical
environments. However, these systems are increasingly vulnerable to
cyber-attacks such as data injection, man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, ICMP
floods, botnet attacks, privilege escalation, and distributed denial-of-service
(DDoS) attacks. Such threats could compromise the integrity and reliability of
radiation measurements, posing significant public health and safety risks. This
paper presents a new synthetic radiation dataset and an Intrusion Detection
System (IDS) tailored for resource-constrained environments, bringing Machine
Learning (ML) predictive capabilities closer to the sensing edge layer of
critical infrastructure. Leveraging TinyML techniques, the proposed IDS employs
an optimized XGBoost model enhanced with pruning, quantization, feature
selection, and sampling. These TinyML techniques significantly reduce the size
of the model and computational demands, enabling real-time intrusion detection
on low-resource devices while maintaining a reasonable balance between
efficiency and accuracy.

TL;DR: This paper presents a Machine Learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) designed to detect Denial of Service (DoS) attacks on Radiation Detection Systems (RDSs), using LightGBM for real-time and efficient anomaly detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RDSs are vulnerable to malicious external attacks that can compromise their functionality, particularly through DoS attacks. The motivation is to enhance the security of RDSs with novel IDS applications using ML techniques.

Method: A simulated DoS attack is created using real radiation data, followed by the evaluation of ML algorithms like Random Forest, SVM, logistic regression, and LightGBM. Optimization techniques including feature selection and TinyML methods are applied to improve efficiency.

Result: LightGBM emerged as the best-performing algorithm, demonstrating high accuracy and low computational requirements in detecting DoS attacks. Model optimization further enhanced its real-time efficacy.

Conclusion: The optimized LightGBM-based IDS offers a robust and efficient solution for detecting DoS attacks in RDSs, safeguarding critical infrastructure effectively.

Abstract: Radiation Detection Systems (RDSs) are used to measure and detect abnormal
levels of radioactive material in the environment. These systems are used in
many applications to mitigate threats posed by high levels of radioactive
material. However, these systems lack protection against malicious external
attacks to modify the data. The novelty of applying Intrusion Detection Systems
(IDS) in RDSs is a crucial element in safeguarding these critical
infrastructures. While IDSs are widely used in networking environments to
safeguard against various attacks, their application in RDSs is novel. A common
attack on RDSs is Denial of Service (DoS), where the attacker aims to overwhelm
the system, causing malfunctioning RDSs. This paper proposes an efficient
Machine Learning (ML)-based IDS to detect anomalies in radiation data, focusing
on DoS attacks. This work explores the use of sampling methods to create a
simulated DoS attack based on a real radiation dataset, followed by an
evaluation of various ML algorithms, including Random Forest, Support Vector
Machine (SVM), logistic regression, and Light Gradient-Boosting Machine
(LightGBM), to detect DoS attacks on RDSs. LightGBM is emphasized for its
superior accuracy and low computational resource consumption, making it
particularly suitable for real-time intrusion detection. Additionally, model
optimization and TinyML techniques, including feature selection, parallel
execution, and random search methods, are used to improve the efficiency of the
proposed IDS. Finally, an optimized and efficient LightGBM-based IDS is
developed to achieve accurate intrusion detection for RDSs.

TL;DR: Safhire is a hybrid inference framework using FHE that offloads nonlinear computations to the client, reducing latency and computation while preserving model confidentiality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to protect users' sensitive data and the server's model confidentiality in cloud-based services.

Method: Utilizing a hybrid framework to distribute linear and non-linear layer computations while applying randomized shuffling and optimizations like ciphertext packing.

Result: Safhire achieves 1.5X–10.5X lower inference latency compared to existing methods with minimal communication overhead and similar accuracy.

Conclusion: Safhire successfully demonstrates the practicality of hybrid FHE inference for secure and efficient cloud-based applications.

Abstract: In contemporary cloud-based services, protecting users' sensitive data and
ensuring the confidentiality of the server's model are critical. Fully
homomorphic encryption (FHE) enables inference directly on encrypted inputs,
but its practicality is hindered by expensive bootstrapping and inefficient
approximations of non-linear activations. We introduce Safhire, a hybrid
inference framework that executes linear layers under encryption on the server
while offloading non-linearities to the client in plaintext. This design
eliminates bootstrapping, supports exact activations, and significantly reduces
computation. To safeguard model confidentiality despite client access to
intermediate outputs, Safhire applies randomized shuffling, which obfuscates
intermediate values and makes it practically impossible to reconstruct the
model. To further reduce latency, Safhire incorporates advanced optimizations
such as fast ciphertext packing and partial extraction. Evaluations on multiple
standard models and datasets show that Safhire achieves 1.5X - 10.5X lower
inference latency than Orion, a state-of-the-art baseline, with manageable
communication overhead and comparable accuracy, thereby establishing the
practicality of hybrid FHE inference.

*Luca Pajola,Eugenio Caripoti,Simeone Pizzi,Mauro Conti,Stefan Banzer,Giovanni Apruzzese*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the shortcomings of current phishing email detection research, introduces a novel dataset (E-PhishLLM) generated with a large language model-based framework (E-PhishGEN), and highlights the need for more realistic and diverse benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the inadequacies of phishing email detection due to outdated and non-representative datasets, which fail to reflect current phishing trends or linguistic diversity.

Method: The authors assess existing machine learning-based methods on older benchmarks, develop an LLM-based framework (E-PhishGEN) to generate novel datasets, and validate the generated dataset (E-PhishLLM) through empirical tests and a user study.

Result: Most methods performed well on old benchmarks but poorly on the more realistic E-PhishLLM dataset, revealing a gap in detection effectiveness against modern phishing attempts.

Conclusion: Phishing email detection remains unsolved. The authors contribute a new dataset and tools to facilitate future research aiming to address the identified gaps.

Abstract: Every day, our inboxes are flooded with unsolicited emails, ranging between
annoying spam to more subtle phishing scams. Unfortunately, despite abundant
prior efforts proposing solutions achieving near-perfect accuracy, the reality
is that countering malicious emails still remains an unsolved dilemma.
  This "open problem" paper carries out a critical assessment of scientific
works in the context of phishing email detection. First, we focus on the
benchmark datasets that have been used to assess the methods proposed in
research. We find that most prior work relied on datasets containing emails
that -- we argue -- are not representative of current trends, and mostly
encompass the English language. Based on this finding, we then re-implement and
re-assess a variety of detection methods reliant on machine learning (ML),
including large-language models (LLM), and release all of our codebase -- an
(unfortunately) uncommon practice in related research. We show that most such
methods achieve near-perfect performance when trained and tested on the same
dataset -- a result which intrinsically hinders development (how can future
research outperform methods that are already near perfect?). To foster the
creation of "more challenging benchmarks" that reflect current phishing trends,
we propose E-PhishGEN, an LLM-based (and privacy-savvy) framework to generate
novel phishing-email datasets. We use our E-PhishGEN to create E-PhishLLM, a
novel phishing-email detection dataset containing 16616 emails in three
languages. We use E-PhishLLM to test the detectors we considered, showing a
much lower performance than that achieved on existing benchmarks -- indicating
a larger room for improvement. We also validate the quality of E-PhishLLM with
a user study (n=30). To sum up, we show that phishing email detection is still
an open problem -- and provide the means to tackle such a problem by future
research.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a machine learning approach for detecting malicious FPGA bitstreams via binary-level analysis, achieving high detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address security risks in FPGA systems caused by malicious bitstreams, including denial-of-service and data leaks.

Method: Utilized machine learning with static byte-level features, TSVD for compression, SMOTE for balancing, and classifiers like Random Forest on re-engineered bitstream data.

Result: Random Forest classifier achieved a macro F1-score of 0.97, demonstrating high accuracy for detecting malicious payloads in FPGA configurations.

Conclusion: The approach enables real-time, efficient detection of malicious bitstreams on limited-resource systems like FPGAs without relying on source code access.

Abstract: The growing use of FPGAs in reconfigurable systems introducessecurity risks
through malicious bitstreams that could cause denial-of-service (DoS), data
leakage, or covert attacks. We investigated chip-level hardware malicious
payload in embedded systems and proposed a supervised machine learning method
to detect malicious bitstreams via static byte-level features. Our approach
diverges from existing methods by analyzing bitstreams directly at the binary
level, enabling real-time detection without requiring access to source code or
netlists. Bitstreams were sourced from state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmarks and
re-engineered to target the Xilinx PYNQ-Z1 FPGA Development Board. Our dataset
included 122 samples of benign and malicious configurations. The data were
vectorized using byte frequency analysis, compressed using TSVD, and balanced
using SMOTE to address class imbalance. The evaluated classifiers demonstrated
that Random Forest achieved a macro F1-score of 0.97, underscoring the
viability of real-time Trojan detection on resource-constrained systems. The
final model was serialized and successfully deployed via PYNQ to enable
integrated bitstream analysis.

### [983] [Q-Learning--Driven Adaptive Rewiring for Cooperative Control in Heterogeneous Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01057)
*Yi-Ning Weng,Hsuan-Wei Lee*

Main category: physics.soc-ph

TL;DR: The study explores how agents in multi-agent systems use Q-learning-based adaptive rewiring to form cooperative clusters and manage social connections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how learning and network dynamics lead to cooperation emergence in multi-agent systems, bridging microscopic rules with macroscopic patterns.

Method: A Q-learning-based adaptive rewiring technique combining temporal difference learning and network restructuring tailored to interaction histories.

Result: Three behavioral regimes identified based on rewiring constraints were observed, revealing that adaptive rewiring enhances cooperation and drives large-scale cluster formation.

Conclusion: Intelligence-driven rewiring mechanisms can spontaneously organize cooperation patterns in complex networks, enabling more effective social connections guided by machine learning principles.

Abstract: Cooperation emergence in multi-agent systems represents a fundamental
statistical physics problem where microscopic learning rules drive macroscopic
collective behavior transitions. We propose a Q-learning-based variant of
adaptive rewiring that builds on mechanisms studied in the literature. This
method combines temporal difference learning with network restructuring so that
agents can optimize strategies and social connections based on interaction
histories. Through neighbor-specific Q-learning, agents develop sophisticated
partnership management strategies that enable cooperator cluster formation,
creating spatial separation between cooperative and defective regions. Using
power-law networks that reflect real-world heterogeneous connectivity patterns,
we evaluate emergent behaviors under varying rewiring constraint levels,
revealing distinct cooperation patterns across parameter space rather than
sharp thermodynamic transitions. Our systematic analysis identifies three
behavioral regimes: a permissive regime (low constraints) enabling rapid
cooperative cluster formation, an intermediate regime with sensitive dependence
on dilemma strength, and a patient regime (high constraints) where strategic
accumulation gradually optimizes network structure. Simulation results show
that while moderate constraints create transition-like zones that suppress
cooperation, fully adaptive rewiring enhances cooperation levels through
systematic exploration of favorable network configurations. Quantitative
analysis reveals that increased rewiring frequency drives large-scale cluster
formation with power-law size distributions. Our results establish a new
paradigm for understanding intelligence-driven cooperation pattern formation in
complex adaptive systems, revealing how machine learning serves as an
alternative driving force for spontaneous organization in multi-agent networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of high-quality annotated data for assessing Quranic recitations and enable accurate pronunciation assessment leveraging Tajweed rules.

Method: Introduced a 98% automated pipeline for dataset creation, fine-tuned wav2vec2-BERT for segmentation, developed the Tasmeea algorithm for transcription verification, created the Quran Phonetic Script, and proposed a multi-level CTC model for pronunciation error detection.

Result: Generated 850+ hours of annotated audio, achieved an average Phoneme Error Rate of 0.16% using the proposed model, and created open-source resources for further research.

Conclusion: The work bridges critical gaps by offering robust tools and datasets for Quranic recitation analysis while enabling advancements in pronunciation assessment and supporting further open-source contributions.

Abstract: Assessing spoken language is challenging, and quantifying pronunciation
metrics for machine learning models is even harder. However, for the Holy
Quran, this task is simplified by the rigorous recitation rules (tajweed)
established by Muslim scholars, enabling highly effective assessment. Despite
this advantage, the scarcity of high-quality annotated data remains a
significant barrier.
  In this work, we bridge these gaps by introducing: (1) A 98% automated
pipeline to produce high-quality Quranic datasets -- encompassing: Collection
of recitations from expert reciters, Segmentation at pause points (waqf) using
our fine-tuned wav2vec2-BERT model, Transcription of segments, Transcript
verification via our novel Tasmeea algorithm; (2) 850+ hours of audio (~300K
annotated utterances); (3) A novel ASR-based approach for pronunciation error
detection, utilizing our custom Quran Phonetic Script (QPS) to encode Tajweed
rules (unlike the IPA standard for Modern Standard Arabic). QPS uses a
two-level script: (Phoneme level): Encodes Arabic letters with short/long
vowels. (Sifa level): Encodes articulation characteristics of every phoneme. We
further include comprehensive modeling with our novel multi-level CTC Model
which achieved 0.16% average Phoneme Error Rate (PER) on the testset. We

overcome their historical latency limitations, offering a promising path
forward for practical voice-based AI agents.

Result: The proposed model performs at a similar level as conventional G2P-based text-to-speech systems while preserving natural accents and intonations.

Conclusion: This approach offers a scalable and cost-effective alternative to traditional methods, making it easier to work with large non-transcribed audio datasets.

Abstract: This study presents a novel approach to voice synthesis that can substitute
the traditional grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion by using a deep
learning-based model that generates discrete tokens directly from speech.
Utilizing a pre-trained voice SSL model, we train a T5 encoder to produce
pseudo-language labels from mixed-script texts (e.g., containing Kanji and
Kana). This method eliminates the need for manual phonetic transcription,
reducing costs and enhancing scalability, especially for large non-transcribed
audio datasets. Our model matches the performance of conventional G2P-based
text-to-speech systems and is capable of synthesizing speech that retains
natural linguistic and paralinguistic features, such as accents and
intonations.

*Yiwei Guo,Bohan Li,Hankun Wang,Zhihan Li,Shuai Wang,Xie Chen,Kai Yu*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper introduces AHAMask, a method to enhance large audio language models (LALMs) by masking specific attention heads to improve task performance without relying on sensitive instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large audio language models suffer from instruction sensitivity, where different instructions may lead to inconsistent outcomes. The motivation is to overcome this limitation and achieve reliable task performance.

Method: The authors propose AHAMask, which masks some attention heads in the LLM decoder of LALMs. These masks are derived by training on a LALM with parameters equal to the attention head count.

Result: The experimental results show that applying AHAMask achieves similar or better performance than relying on instructions, for both single and composite tasks.

Conclusion: AHAMask not only improves task reliability in LALMs but also uncovers functional pathways within their attention head mechanisms.

Abstract: Although current large audio language models (LALMs) extend text large
language models (LLMs) with generic acoustic understanding abilities, they
usually suffer from instruction sensitivity, where different instructions of
the same intention can yield drastically different outcomes. In this work, we
propose AHAMask, where we simply mask some of the attention heads in the
decoder-only LLM backbone of LALMs, to trigger specific acoustic task
functionalities without instructions. These masks are efficiently obtained by
training on an LALM, with the number of trainable parameters equal to the
attention head count in its LLM backbone. We show by experiments that applying
such selective attention head masks achieves comparable or even better
performance than using instructions, either on single or composite tasks.
Besides achieving reliable acoustic task specification for LALMs, this also
reveals that LALMs exhibit certain "functional pathways" in their attention
heads.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional music visualization systems lack expressiveness due to reliance on manually-crafted shapes and colors.

Method: The authors use latent feature-based audio analysis techniques combined with language models for textual scene generation, followed by generative models to produce videos.

Result: Generated videos demonstrate storytelling abilities, visual coherence, and emotional alignment with music, as per a preliminary user evaluation.

Conclusion: Latent feature approaches and deep generative methods show promise in advancing music visualization techniques beyond traditional approaches.

Abstract: Conventional music visualisation systems rely on handcrafted ad hoc
transformations of shapes and colours that offer only limited expressiveness.
We propose two novel pipelines for automatically generating music videos from
any user-specified, vocal or instrumental song using off-the-shelf deep
learning models. Inspired by the manual workflows of music video producers, we
experiment on how well latent feature-based techniques can analyse audio to
detect musical qualities, such as emotional cues and instrumental patterns, and
distil them into textual scene descriptions using a language model. Next, we
employ a generative model to produce the corresponding video clips. To assess
the generated videos, we identify several critical aspects and design and
conduct a preliminary user evaluation that demonstrates storytelling potential,
visual coherency and emotional alignment with the music. Our findings
underscore the potential of latent feature techniques and deep generative
models to expand music visualisation beyond traditional approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a less complex and low-latency neural speech codec by challenging the reliance on multi-stage residual vector quantization (RVQ) stacks.

Method: The method involves treating mel-spectrograms as 2D data, quantizing 4x4 patches into a shared codebook, employing adversarial fine-tuning for VQ-VAE, and training a HiFi-GAN vocoder for high-fidelity synthesis.

Result: The proposed codec operates at about 7.5 kbits/s for 16 kHz speech and achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art neural codecs on perceptual quality and intelligibility metrics.

Conclusion: A simplified non-residual codec design is presented, demonstrating its effectiveness as a foundation for future low-latency codec applications.

Abstract: We present a neural speech codec that challenges the need for complex
residual vector quantization (RVQ) stacks by introducing a simpler,
single-stage quantization approach. Our method operates directly on the
mel-spectrogram, treating it as a 2D data and quantizing non-overlapping 4x4
patches into a single, shared codebook. This patchwise design simplifies the
architecture, enables low-latency streaming, and yields a discrete latent grid.
To ensure high-fidelity synthesis, we employ a late-stage adversarial
fine-tuning for the VQ-VAE and train a HiFi-GAN vocoder from scratch on the
codec's reconstructed spectrograms. Operating at approximately 7.5 kbits/s for
16 kHz speech, our system was evaluated against several state-of-the-art neural
codecs using objective metrics such as STOI, PESQ, MCD, and ViSQOL. The results
demonstrate that our simplified, non-residual architecture achieves competitive
perceptual quality and intelligibility, validating it as an effective and open

*Ashwin Nagarajan,Hao-Wen Dong*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper explores the challenges of fine-grained stylistic control in text-to-music models and evaluates human-readable modifiers generated by a large language model as an alternative to artist-name prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitations of existing stylization methods, which often require retraining or specialized conditioning, and to evaluate policy-compliant alternatives for controlling music style without using artist names.

Method: The authors use MusicGen-small and evaluate stylistic control for two artists—Billie Eilish and Ludovico Einaudi—comparing baseline prompts, artist-name prompts, and descriptors generated by a large language model. Both VGGish and CLAP embeddings are used for similarity evaluation.

Result: The findings show that artist-name prompts are the strongest control signal for stylistic alignment, but name-free descriptors recover much of the stylistic effect. Additionally, descriptors encode specific stylistic cues but exhibit reduced alignment in cross-artist transfers.

Conclusion: This study highlights the name-free gap—the controllability difference between artist-name prompts and policy-compliant descriptors—and proposes a reproducible evaluation protocol for understanding prompt-level controllability in text-to-music systems.

Abstract: Text-to-music models capture broad attributes such as instrumentation or
mood, but fine-grained stylistic control remains an open challenge. Existing
stylization methods typically require retraining or specialized conditioning,
which complicates reproducibility and limits policy compliance when artist
names are restricted. We study whether lightweight, human-readable modifiers
sampled from a large language model can provide a policy-robust alternative for
stylistic control. Using MusicGen-small, we evaluate two artists: Billie Eilish
(vocal pop) and Ludovico Einaudi (instrumental piano). For each artist, we use
fifteen reference excerpts and evaluate matched seeds under three conditions:
baseline prompts, artist-name prompts, and five descriptor sets. All prompts
are generated using a large language model. Evaluation uses both VGGish and
CLAP embeddings with distributional and per-clip similarity measures, including
a new min-distance attribution metric. Results show that artist names are the
strongest control signal across both artists, while name-free descriptors
recover much of this effect. This highlights that existing safeguards such as
the restriction of artist names in music generation prompts may not fully
prevent style imitation. Cross-artist transfers reduce alignment, showing that
descriptors encode targeted stylistic cues. We also present a descriptor table
across ten contemporary artists to illustrate the breadth of the tokens.
Together these findings define the name-free gap, the controllability
difference between artist-name prompts and policy-compliant descriptors, shown
through a reproducible evaluation protocol for prompt-level controllability.

### [997] [FLM-Audio: Natural Monologues Improves Native Full-Duplex Chatbots via Dual Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02521)
*Yiqun Yao,Xiang Li,Xin Jiang,Xuezhi Fang,Naitong Yu,Wenjia Ma,Aixin Sun,Yequan Wang*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to improve full-duplex dialog models by using a continuous token-based approach for synchronizing textual and audio inputs, overcoming alignment challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of aligning textual monologues with audio streams in full-duplex dialog models without degrading large pre-trained language models or requiring highly accurate timestamps.

Method: Proposed the use of natural textual monologues in continuous token sequences alongside a dual training paradigm that alternates between leading and trailing position relative to the audio during training.

Result: Developed FLM-Audio, a 7B spoken dialog model demonstrating enhanced responsiveness, duplexity, and overall user chatting experiences based on experimental assessments.

Conclusion: The paper presents an effective approach for improving alignment and responsiveness in full-duplex dialog models, leveraging natural textual monologues and dual training strategies.

Abstract: Full-duplex dialog models are designed to listen and speak simultaneously
with rapid responses to fast-changing user input. Among existing approaches,
native full-duplex models merges different channels (e.g. listen and speak) in
a single time step, overcoming the high response latency inherent to
time-division multiplexing time-division multiplexing (TDM) alternatives. Yet,
a key challenge remains: aligning textual monologues with audio streams that
operate at different bitrates. The prevailing solution relies on word-level
alignment, but this can degrade the language ability of large pre-trained
models. Moreover, it requires highly accurate timestamps for every token, which
introduces cascading errors and increases pre-processing costs. In this paper,
we propose textual monologues in continuous tokens sequence, namely "natural"
monologues, which mimics humanoid cognitive behavior in dialogs. For temporal
alignment, we alternate the position of the natural monologue - leading or
trailing the audio - across different training stages. This "dual" training
paradigm proves highly effective in building FLM-Audio, our 7B spoken dialog
model that demonstrates superior responsiveness, duplexity, and chatting
experiences, as confirmed by experimental results.

*Gyehun Go,Satbyul Han,Ahyeon Choi,Eunjin Choi,Juhan Nam,Jeong Mi Park*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The study evaluates text-to-music (TTM) systems based on their ability to convey intended emotions, using a benchmark called AImoclips.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the emotional fidelity of TTM systems since this aspect is less explored compared to text alignment or human preference.

Method: They benchmarked 6 TTM systems, generated 1,000 clips, and collected emotion ratings (valence & arousal) from 111 participants using Likert scales.

Result: Commercial systems produced more pleasant than intended emotions, whereas open-source ones deviated in the opposite direction. High-arousal conditions resulted in better emotion conveyance across models.

Conclusion: TTM systems face a bias towards emotional neutrality, presenting a limitation in affective controllability. AImoclips provides insights for improving this aspect in future systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-music (TTM) generation have enabled controllable
and expressive music creation using natural language prompts. However, the
emotional fidelity of TTM systems remains largely underexplored compared to
human preference or text alignment. In this study, we introduce AImoclips, a
benchmark for evaluating how well TTM systems convey intended emotions to human
listeners, covering both open-source and commercial models. We selected 12
emotion intents spanning four quadrants of the valence-arousal space, and used
six state-of-the-art TTM systems to generate over 1,000 music clips. A total of
111 participants rated the perceived valence and arousal of each clip on a
9-point Likert scale. Our results show that commercial systems tend to produce
music perceived as more pleasant than intended, while open-source systems tend
to perform the opposite. Emotions are more accurately conveyed under
high-arousal conditions across all models. Additionally, all systems exhibit a
bias toward emotional neutrality, highlighting a key limitation in affective
controllability. This benchmark offers valuable insights into model-specific
emotion rendering characteristics and supports future development of
emotionally aligned TTM systems.

Abstract: Traffic congestion remains a pressing urban challenge, requiring intelligent
transportation systems for real-time management. We present a hybrid framework
that combines deep learning and reinforcement learning for acoustic vehicle
speed classification. A dual-branch BMCNN processes MFCC and wavelet features
to capture complementary frequency patterns. An attention-enhanced DQN
adaptively selects the minimal number of audio frames and triggers early
decisions once confidence thresholds are reached. Evaluations on IDMT-Traffic
and our SZUR-Acoustic (Suzhou) datasets show 95.99% and 92.3% accuracy, with up
to 1.63x faster average processing via early termination. Compared with A3C,
DDDQN, SA2C, PPO, and TD3, the method provides a superior accuracy-efficiency
trade-off and is suitable for real-time ITS deployment in heterogeneous urban
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create a speech-command recognition system that operates efficiently under strict memory and computational constraints, making it usable for IoT devices and other resource-limited applications.

Method: The method combined energy-based voice activity detection (VAD), an optimized Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) pipeline with adaptive binning, and the LogNNet reservoir-computing classifier. The system was evaluated with four commands from the Speech Commands dataset and implemented on an Arduino Nano for validation.

Result: The presented system using the LogNNet classifier achieved 92.04% accuracy in speaker-independent scenarios, with only 18 KB of RAM (~55% utilization) on an Arduino Nano 33 IoT, demonstrating real-time speech-command recognition.

Conclusion: This proposed pipeline demonstrates the feasibility of deploying accurate and low-resource speech-command recognition systems on battery-powered IoT devices under constrained environments.

Abstract: This paper presents a low-resource speech-command recognizer combining
energy-based voice activity detection (VAD), an optimized Mel-Frequency
Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) pipeline, and the LogNNet reservoir-computing
classifier. Using four commands from the Speech Commands da-taset downsampled
to 8 kHz, we evaluate four MFCC aggregation schemes and find that adaptive
binning (64-dimensional feature vector) offers the best accuracy-to-compactness
trade-off. The LogNNet classifier with architecture 64:33:9:4 reaches 92.04%
accuracy under speaker-independent evaluation, while requiring significantly
fewer parameters than conventional deep learn-ing models. Hardware
implementation on Arduino Nano 33 IoT (ARM Cor-tex-M0+, 48 MHz, 32 KB RAM)
validates the practical feasibility, achieving ~90% real-time recognition
accuracy while consuming only 18 KB RAM (55% utilization). The complete
pipeline (VAD -> MFCC -> LogNNet) thus enables reliable on-device
speech-command recognition under strict memory and compute limits, making it
suitable for battery-powered IoT nodes, wire-less sensor networks, and
hands-free control interfaces.

them infeasible to deploy on edge devices, such as smartphones and wearables,
with limited computational resources. In this work, we present TinyMusician, a
lightweight music generation model distilled from MusicGen (a State-of-the-art

*Yun Chu,Qiuhao Wang,Enze Zhou,Qian Liu,Gang Zheng*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper introduces a graph neural network-based framework for precise and flexible abnormal respiratory sound event detection, addressing limitations in variable-length audio processing and location-based detection effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Respiratory sound analysis is crucial for early diagnosis, but existing methods face challenges like subjectivity, reliance on fixed audio lengths, and inaccurate temporal localization.

Method: The proposal involves a graph neural network framework with anchor intervals to handle variable-length audio and achieve more accurate abnormal sound localization. The framework also incorporates respiratory position information.

Result: Experiments conducted on two datasets (SPRSound 2024 and HF Lung V1) validate the method's accuracy and the benefit of using position information in improving sound discrimination.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a significant improvement in the adaptability and precision of respiratory sound event detection, enabling practical advancements in medical diagnostics.

Abstract: Auscultation is a key method for early diagnosis of respiratory and pulmonary
diseases, relying on skilled healthcare professionals. However, the process is
often subjective, with variability between experts. As a result, numerous deep
learning-based automatic classification methods have emerged, most of which
focus on respiratory sound classification. In contrast, research on respiratory
sound event detection remains limited. Existing sound event detection methods
typically rely on frame-level predictions followed by post-processing to
generate event-level outputs, making interval boundaries challenging to learn
directly. Furthermore, many approaches can only handle fixed-length audio, lim-
iting their applicability to variable-length respiratory sounds. Additionally,
the impact of respiratory sound location information on detection performance
has not been extensively explored. To address these issues, we propose a graph
neural network-based framework with anchor intervals, capable of handling
variable-length audio and providing more precise temporal localization for
abnormal respi- ratory sound events. Our method improves both the flexibility
and applicability of respiratory sound detection. Experiments on the SPRSound
2024 and HF Lung V1 datasets demonstrate the effec- tiveness of the proposed
approach, and incorporating respiratory position information enhances the
discrimination between abnormal sounds.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in separating overlapping speech in human-vehicle interaction, which is critical to improving automatic speech recognition systems.

Method: CabinSep leverages spatial features through channel information, applies MVDR for distortion reduction during inference, and uses a novel data augmentation combining simulated and real-recorded impulse responses.

Result: CabinSep demonstrates a computational efficiency of 0.4 GMACs and achieves a 17.5% improvement in speech recognition error reduction compared to the DualSep model on real-recorded datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a lightweight, effective solution for reducing speech recognition errors and facilitates more precise speech separation and speaker localization in vehicular environments.

Abstract: Separating overlapping speech from multiple speakers is crucial for effective
human-vehicle interaction. This paper proposes CabinSep, a lightweight neural
mask-based minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) speech separation
approach, to reduce speech recognition errors in back-end automatic speech
recognition (ASR) models. Our contributions are threefold: First, we utilize
channel information to extract spatial features, which improves the estimation
of speech and noise masks. Second, we employ MVDR during inference, reducing
speech distortion to make it more ASR-friendly. Third, we introduce a data
augmentation method combining simulated and real-recorded impulse responses
(IRs), improving speaker localization at zone boundaries and further reducing
speech recognition errors. With a computational complexity of only 0.4 GMACs,
CabinSep achieves a 17.5% relative reduction in speech recognition error rate
in a real-recorded dataset compared to the state-of-the-art DualSep model.

*Andrea Poltronieri,Xavier Serra,Martín Rocamora*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper tackles challenges in Audio Chord Estimation (ACE) including inter-annotator inconsistencies and class imbalance. It introduces a consonance-based evaluation metric and proposes a novel conformer-based ACE model integrating these concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations in audio chord estimation caused by annotator subjectivity and class imbalance, aiming to improve the transcription and analysis of music.

Method: The paper evaluates inter-annotator agreement using advanced metrics and introduces a consonance-informed distance metric. A novel conformer-based ACE model with consonance-based label smoothing is proposed, addressing class imbalance via decomposed chord estimation.

Result: Consonance-based metrics demonstrated better alignment with musical perceptual similarities. The proposed conformer-based model improved the accuracy of chord reconstruction and addressed class imbalance effectively.

Conclusion: Integrating perceptual consonance concepts and addressing dataset imbalances enhances the performance and meaningfulness of Audio Chord Estimation models.

Abstract: Audio Chord Estimation (ACE) holds a pivotal role in music information
research, having garnered attention for over two decades due to its relevance
for music transcription and analysis. Despite notable advancements, challenges
persist in the task, particularly concerning unique characteristics of harmonic
content, which have resulted in existing systems' performances reaching a glass
ceiling. These challenges include annotator subjectivity, where varying
interpretations among annotators lead to inconsistencies, and class imbalance
within chord datasets, where certain chord classes are over-represented
compared to others, posing difficulties in model training and evaluation. As a
first contribution, this paper presents an evaluation of inter-annotator
agreement in chord annotations, using metrics that extend beyond traditional
binary measures. In addition, we propose a consonance-informed distance metric
that reflects the perceptual similarity between harmonic annotations. Our
analysis suggests that consonance-based distance metrics more effectively
capture musically meaningful agreement between annotations. Expanding on these
findings, we introduce a novel ACE conformer-based model that integrates
consonance concepts into the model through consonance-based label smoothing.
The proposed model also addresses class imbalance by separately estimating
root, bass, and all note activations, enabling the reconstruction of chord
labels from decomposed outputs.

TL;DR: This paper compares classical machine learning methods using hand-crafted features with deep learning (CNN) for music genre classification, finding that SVM outperforms CNN on the GTZAN dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to determine whether traditional machine learning methods using domain-specific feature engineering can outperform deep learning models on a standard dataset for music genre classification.

Method: The paper evaluates classical classifiers (SVM and ensemble methods) based on hand-crafted audio features versus a CNN that operates on Mel spectrograms, using the GTZAN dataset.

Result: SVM achieves higher classification accuracy than CNN due to the regularization effect of engineered features, especially given the data-constrained nature of the GTZAN dataset.

Conclusion: The study highlights the enduring importance of feature engineering over deep learning models, particularly for practical tasks with moderately sized datasets, challenging the universal applicability of deep learning.

Abstract: This paper presents a comparative analysis of machine learning methodologies
for automatic music genre classification. We evaluate the performance of
classical classifiers, including Support Vector Machines (SVM) and ensemble
methods, trained on a comprehensive set of hand-crafted audio features, against
a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) operating on Mel spectrograms. The study
is conducted on the widely-used GTZAN dataset. Our findings demonstrate a
noteworthy result: the SVM, leveraging domain-specific feature engineering,
achieves superior classification accuracy compared to the end-to-end CNN model.
We attribute this outcome to the data-constrained nature of the benchmark
dataset, where the strong inductive bias of engineered features provides a
regularization effect that mitigates the risk of overfitting inherent in
high-capacity deep learning models. This work underscores the enduring
relevance of traditional feature extraction in practical audio processing tasks
and provides a critical perspective on the universal applicability of deep
learning, especially for moderately sized datasets.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the lack of clear definitions and evaluation methods for audio tokenization in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), proposing new definitions and a systematic evaluation framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to improve audio tokenization for MLLMs by addressing the ambiguity in defining semantic and acoustic tokens and the lack of comprehensive evaluation methods.

Method: The paper redefines semantic and acoustic tokens and introduces a systematic evaluation framework covering audio reconstruction, codebook ID stability, transformer perplexity, and downstream performance.

Result: The proposed definitions are validated, and a correlation is found among reconstruction quality, codebook stability, perplexity, and downstream tasks.

Conclusion: The study advances how audio tokens are defined and evaluated, enabling more effective audio tokenization for multimodal applications.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have been widely applied in speech
and music. This tendency has led to a focus on audio tokenization for Large
Models (LMs). Unlike semantic-only text tokens, audio tokens must both capture
global semantic content and preserve fine-grained acoustic details. Moreover,
they provide a discrete method for speech and music that can be effectively
integrated into MLLMs. However, existing research is unsuitable in the
definitions of semantic tokens and acoustic tokens. In addition, the evaluation
of different codecs typically concentrates on specific domains or tasks, such
as reconstruction or Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) task, which prevents
fair and comprehensive comparisons. To address these problems, this paper
provides suitable definitions for semantic and acoustic tokens and introduces a
systematic evaluation framework. This framework allows for a comprehensive
assessment of codecs' capabilities which evaluate across four dimensions: audio
reconstruction metric, codebook index (ID) stability, decoder-only transformer
perplexity, and performance on downstream probe tasks. Our results show the
correctness of the provided suitable definitions and the correlation among
reconstruction metrics, codebook ID stability, downstream probe tasks and
perplexity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the applicability of pre-trained speech models to non-speech data, such as baby cries, and to understand the acoustic properties these models encode.

Method: Analyzed five pre-trained speech models across eight baby cries datasets, covering 115 hours of audio from 960 babies, evaluating them for various classification tasks.

Result: The models effectively classified baby cries, capturing vocal source instability and identity, offering valuable acoustic insights.

Conclusion: Pre-trained speech models are effective for classifying non-speech audio like baby cries, with implications for designing models for tasks like emotion detection.

Abstract: Transfer learning using latent representations from pre-trained speech models
achieves outstanding performance in tasks where labeled data is scarce.
However, their applicability to non-speech data and the specific acoustic
properties encoded in these representations remain largely unexplored. In this
study, we investigate both aspects. We evaluate five pre-trained speech models
on eight baby cries datasets, encompassing 115 hours of audio from 960 babies.
For each dataset, we assess the latent representations of each model across all
available classification tasks. Our results demonstrate that the latent
representations of these models can effectively classify human baby cries and
encode key information related to vocal source instability and identity of the
crying baby. In addition, a comparison of the architectures and training
strategies of these models offers valuable insights for the design of future
models tailored to similar tasks, such as emotion detection.

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel framework, ESTM, to enhance anomalous sound detection by addressing time-frequency coupling limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a challenge in detecting anomalous industrial equipment sounds due to the difficulty in modeling long-range temporal and cross-frequency couplings.

Method: They propose the ESTM framework, leveraging a dual-path Mamba architecture, Selective State-Space Models for sequence modeling, and TriStat-Gating for pattern sensitivity.

Result: ESTM demonstrated improved detection performance on the DCASE 2020 Task 2 dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed ESTM framework is effective for enhancing anomalous sound detection by capturing richer time-frequency characteristics and dynamic couplings.

Abstract: The core challenge in industrial equipment anoma lous sound detection (ASD)
lies in modeling the time-frequency coupling characteristics of acoustic
features. Existing modeling methods are limited by local receptive fields,
making it difficult to capture long-range temporal patterns and cross-band
dynamic coupling effects in machine acoustic features. In this paper, we
propose a novel framework, ESTM, which is based on a dual-path Mamba
architecture with time-frequency decoupled modeling and utilizes Selective
State-Space Models (SSM) for long-range sequence modeling. ESTM extracts rich
feature representations from different time segments and frequency bands by
fusing enhanced Mel spectrograms and raw audio features, while further
improving sensitivity to anomalous patterns through the TriStat-Gating (TSG)
module. Our experiments demonstrate that ESTM improves anomalous detection
performance on the DCASE 2020 Task 2 dataset, further validating the
effectiveness of the proposed method.

for no-code BCI design, making it accessible to researchers with minimal
programming experience. For advanced users, it facilitates the seamless
integration of custom functionalities and novel algorithms with minimal coding,
ensuring adaptability at each design stage. PyNoetic also includes a rich array
of analytical tools such as machine learning models, brain-connectivity
indices, systematic testing functionalities via simulation, and evaluation
methods of novel paradigms. PyNoetic's strengths lie in its versatility for
both offline and real-time BCI development, which streamlines the design

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper proposes a fluid antenna enabled physical layer key generation system to improve the key generation rate in harsh wireless environments, showing significant improvement over existing benchmarks with novel algorithmic optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physical layer key generation faces challenges in harsh wireless environments due to unsatisfactory channel characteristics and deteriorated key generation rates.

Method: The authors introduced a fluid antenna array system, derived a closed-form KGR expression, and employed optimization algorithms like particle swarm optimization and alternating optimization combining projected gradient descent to optimize precoding matrix and antenna positions.

Result: Simulation results show the proposed system outperforms fixed-position antenna arrays and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces. Specifically, the system achieves a 35.42% KGR improvement under PSO and a 67.73% KGR improvement under AO compared to conventional uniform planar antenna arrays.

Conclusion: Fluid antennas offer enhanced spatial degrees of freedom and significantly improve the KGR performance, proving their effectiveness as a promising enhancement for physical layer security systems.

Abstract: As a promising physical layer security technique, physical layer key
generation (PLKG) enables legitimate users to obtain secret keys from wireless
channel without security infrastructures. However, in harsh propagation
environments, the channel characteristic becomes unsatisfactory, the key
generation rate (KGR) is significantly deteriorated. In this paper, we propose
a novel fluid antenna (FA) enabled PLKG system to address this challenge.
Specifically, we first derive the closed-form expression of the KGR for FA
array, and then jointly optimize the precoding matrix and the antenna positions
via a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Next, to further reduce the
computational complexity of the optimization procedure, we develop an
alternating optimization (AO) algorithm, which combines the projected gradient
descent (PGD) and the PSO. Simulation results demonstrate that by exploiting
the additional spatial degree of freedom (DoF), our FA enabled PLKG system is
superior to the benchmarks, such as the conventional fixed-position antenna
(FPA) array and the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). It is worth
highlighting that compared to the conventional uniform planar antenna (UPA),
the FA enabled PLKG achieves a 35.42\% KGR performance improvement under PSO
algorithm and a 67.73\% KGR performance improvement under AO algorithm,
respectively.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on single-channel EEG data to detect sleep apnea, achieving 85.1% accuracy as a more accessible alternative to the costly Polysomnography (PSG).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods, like Polysomnography, for diagnosing sleep apnea are expensive, labor-intensive, and inconvenient, often leading to poor-quality data. Simplifying and improving diagnostics is essential to better address this prevalent condition.

Method: The researchers used a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on single-channel EEG data. They implemented data preprocessing with an IIR Butterworth filter, constructed datasets for broader temporal context, and handled class imbalance with SMOTETomek.

Result: The CNN model achieved an accuracy of 85.1% and a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.22, showing strong potential for in-home use.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the feasibility of shifting from costly lab-based diagnostics to accessible, automated home-based solutions for sleep apnea detection, potentially improving healthcare accessibility and patient outcomes.

Abstract: Sleep apnea, a prevalent sleep disorder, involves repeated episodes of
breathing interruptions during sleep, leading to various health complications,
including cognitive impairments, high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke,
and even death. One of the main challenges in diagnosing and treating sleep
apnea is identifying individuals at risk. The current gold standard for
diagnosis, Polysomnography (PSG), is costly, labor intensive, and inconvenient,
often resulting in poor quality sleep data. This paper presents a novel
approach to the detection of sleep apnea using a Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) trained on single channel EEG data. The proposed CNN achieved an accuracy
of 85.1% and a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.22, demonstrating a
significant potential for home based applications by addressing the limitations
of PSG in automated sleep apnea detection. Key contributions of this work also
include the development of a comprehensive preprocessing pipeline with an
Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) Butterworth filter, a dataset construction
method providing broader temporal context, and the application of SMOTETomek to
address class imbalance. This research underscores the feasibility of
transitioning from traditional laboratory based diagnostics to more accessible,
automated home based solutions, improving patient outcomes and broadening the
accessibility of sleep disorder diagnostics.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method that uses wrist-worn sensor signals to simulate shoe-mounted sensor signals for advanced gait analysis, leveraging Conditional GANs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome limitations in gait analysis by using wrist-worn sensors instead of shoe-mounted ones, increasing convenience for daily usage.

Method: Conditional GANs, both traditional and WGANs, were employed, with architectures like convolutional autoencoder and convolutional U-Net for signal translation.

Result: Experiments showed successful translation of wrist sensor signals to shoe sensor signals, enabling accurate gait analysis.

Conclusion: The approach is effective in facilitating everyday gait analysis with wrist-worn sensors by accurately simulating shoe-mounted sensor data.

Abstract: The paper presents an approach in which inertial signals measured with a
wrist-worn sensor (e.g., a smartwatch) are translated into those that would be
recorded using a shoe-mounted sensor, enabling the use of state-of-the-art gait
analysis methods. In the study, the signals are translated using Conditional
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Two different GAN versions are used for
experimental verification: traditional ones trained using binary cross-entropy
loss and Wasserstein GANs (WGANs). For the generator, two architectures, a
convolutional autoencoder, and a convolutional U-Net, are tested. The
experiment results have shown that the proposed approach allows for an accurate
translation, enabling the use of wrist sensor inertial signals for efficient,
every-day gait analysis.

*Yuzhi Yang,Omar Alhussein,Mérouane Debbah*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper presents a non-identical diffusion model for wireless MIMO-OFDM channel generation, addressing limitations of standard models by introducing element-wise time indicators for noise level variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the recovery of wireless MIMO-OFDM channel matrices where initial estimates exhibit uneven reliability across elements due to pilot schemes.

Method: The paper introduces a non-identical diffusion model with an element-wise time indicator, and proposes a dimension-wise time embedding strategy for MIMO-OFDM channel generation. Training and generation methods are developed and numerically compared.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates theoretical correctness and effectiveness, with improved generation performance over conventional time embeddings.

Conclusion: The non-identical diffusion model enhances the accuracy of wireless OFDM channel generation by capturing local error variations and addressing the limitations of uniform noise assumptions in conventional models.

Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion model, termed the non-identical diffusion model,
and investigate its application to wireless orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM) channel generation. Unlike the standard diffusion model
that uses a scalar-valued time index to represent the global noise level, we
extend this notion to an element-wise time indicator to capture local error
variations more accurately. Non-identical diffusion enables us to characterize
the reliability of each element (e.g., subcarriers in OFDM) within the noisy
input, leading to improved generation results when the initialization is
biased. Specifically, we focus on the recovery of wireless multi-input
multi-output (MIMO) OFDM channel matrices, where the initial channel estimates
exhibit highly uneven reliability across elements due to the pilot scheme.
Conventional time embeddings, which assume uniform noise progression, fail to
capture such variability across pilot schemes and noise levels. We introduce a
matrix that matches the input size to control element-wise noise progression.
Following a similar diffusion procedure to existing methods, we show the
correctness and effectiveness of the proposed non-identical diffusion scheme
both theoretically and numerically. For MIMO-OFDM channel generation, we
propose a dimension-wise time embedding strategy. We also develop and evaluate
multiple training and generation methods and compare them through numerical
experiments.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper introduces SoM-MIMO, a task-driven system combining JSCC and digital MIMO to enhance image transmission for cooperative perception in networked mobile agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of transmitting sensory data efficiently and robustly in cooperative perception scenarios, especially for mobile agents under complex tasks and adverse channel conditions.

Method: The paper leverages the structural properties of feature pyramids and the channel characteristics of digital MIMO systems to design the SoM-MIMO framework for perceptual tasks.

Result: SoM-MIMO achieves significant mAP improvements (6.30 and 10.48) across all SNR levels compared to existing JSCC approaches, without increasing communication overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed SoM-MIMO system provides efficient and robust solutions for digital MIMO image transmission, advancing task-driven communication for networked agents.

Abstract: To support cooperative perception (CP) of networked mobile agents in dynamic
scenarios, the efficient and robust transmission of sensory data is a critical
challenge. Deep learning-based joint source-channel coding (JSCC) has
demonstrated promising results for image transmission under adverse channel
conditions, outperforming traditional rule-based codecs. While recent works
have explored to combine JSCC with the widely adopted multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) technology, these approaches are still limited to the
discrete-time analog transmission (DTAT) model and simple tasks. Given the
limited performance of existing MIMO JSCC schemes in supporting complex CP
tasks for networked mobile agents with digital MIMO communication systems, this
paper presents a Synesthesia of Machines (SoM)-based task-driven MIMO system
for image transmission, referred to as SoM-MIMO. By leveraging the structural
properties of the feature pyramid for perceptual tasks and the channel
properties of the closed-loop MIMO communication system, SoM-MIMO enables
efficient and robust digital MIMO transmission of images. Experimental results
have shown that compared with two JSCC baseline schemes, our approach achieves
average mAP improvements of 6.30 and 10.48 across all SNR levels, while
maintaining identical communication overhead.

*Mihir Bafna,Bowen Jing,Bonnie Berger*

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: DynaProt predicts protein dynamics directly from static structures, offering a scalable and computationally efficient alternative to molecular dynamics simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding protein dynamics is crucial for elucidating biological functions, but molecular dynamics simulations are computationally expensive.

Method: DynaProt leverages SE(3)-invariant multivariate Gaussian frameworks to estimate protein dynamics at two complementary scales: marginal anisotropy per residue and joint scalar covariances between residues.

Result: DynaProt achieves high accuracy in predicting residue flexibility (RMSF), enables reconstruction of full covariance matrices for ensemble generation, and does so efficiently with fewer parameters.

Conclusion: DynaProt offers a scalable, accurate framework for protein dynamics prediction, paving the way for alternatives to computationally expensive methods.

Abstract: Many methods have been developed to predict static protein structures,
however understanding the dynamics of protein structure is essential for
elucidating biological function. While molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
remain the in silico gold standard, its high computational cost limits
scalability. We present DynaProt, a lightweight, SE(3)-invariant framework that
predicts rich descriptors of protein dynamics directly from static structures.
By casting the problem through the lens of multivariate Gaussians, DynaProt
estimates dynamics at two complementary scales: (1) per-residue marginal
anisotropy as $3 \times 3$ covariance matrices capturing local flexibility, and
(2) joint scalar covariances encoding pairwise dynamic coupling across
residues. From these dynamics outputs, DynaProt achieves high accuracy in
predicting residue-level flexibility (RMSF) and, remarkably, enables reasonable
reconstruction of the full covariance matrix for fast ensemble generation.
Notably, it does so using orders of magnitude fewer parameters than prior
methods. Our results highlight the potential of direct protein dynamics
prediction as a scalable alternative to existing methods.

*Aditya Sengar,Ali Hariri,Pierre Vandergheynst,Patrick Barth*

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: This paper extends a generative model for biomolecular dynamics by introducing a temporal propagator in the latent space, evaluating three methods and their trade-offs for long-term simulation stability and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenge of modeling long-timescale biomolecular dynamics without relying on predefined collective variables and to establish methods that can simulate temporal evolution effectively.

Method: The authors extend LD-FPG with a temporal propagator in a unified encoder-propagator-decoder framework and compare three propagators: score-guided Langevin dynamics, Koopman-based linear operators, and autoregressive neural networks, evaluating them on stability, thermodynamics, and free-energy landscapes.

Result: Autoregressive neural networks showed the most robust long-term stability; score-guided Langevin dynamics recovered side-chain thermodynamics well when the score was accurate; and Koopman-based approaches provided lightweight and interpretable trade-offs but damped fluctuations.

Conclusion: The study highlights the strengths and limitations of different propagators, providing practical guidance on their usage in latent-space simulators for all-atom protein dynamics.

Abstract: Simulating the long-timescale dynamics of biomolecules is a central challenge
in computational science. While enhanced sampling methods can accelerate these
simulations, they rely on pre-defined collective variables that are often
difficult to identify. A recent generative model, LD-FPG, demonstrated that
this problem could be bypassed by learning to sample the static equilibrium
ensemble as all-atom deformations from a reference structure, establishing a
powerful method for all-atom ensemble generation. However, while this approach
successfully captures a system's probable conformations, it does not model the
temporal evolution between them. Here we extend LD-FPG with a temporal
propagator that operates within the learned latent space and compare three
classes: (i) score-guided Langevin dynamics, (ii) Koopman-based linear
operators, and (iii) autoregressive neural networks. Within a unified
encoder-propagator-decoder framework, we evaluate long-horizon stability,
backbone and side-chain ensemble fidelity, and functional free-energy
landscapes. Autoregressive neural networks deliver the most robust long
rollouts; score-guided Langevin best recovers side-chain thermodynamics when
the score is well learned; and Koopman provides an interpretable, lightweight
baseline that tends to damp fluctuations. These results clarify the trade-offs
among propagators and offer practical guidance for latent-space simulators of
all-atom protein dynamics.

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: This paper introduces PepMorph, a peptide discovery tool that uses machine learning to design sequences for specific self-assembling morphologies, achieving 83% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for predicting peptide self-assembly morphology are computationally intractable due to the vast sequence space.

Method: The authors developed PepMorph, which uses a Transformer-based Conditional Variational Autoencoder with a masking mechanism, trained on a new dataset of peptide descriptors.

Result: PepMorph achieved 83% accuracy in generating peptides with the desired fibrillar or spherical morphology.

Conclusion: The PepMorph framework demonstrates great potential for application-driven discoveries in peptide design with controlled morphologies.

Abstract: Peptide self-assembly prediction offers a powerful bottom-up strategy for
designing biocompatible, low-toxicity materials for large-scale synthesis in a
broad range of biomedical and energy applications. However, screening the vast
sequence space for categorization of aggregate morphology remains intractable.
We introduce PepMorph, an end-to-end peptide discovery pipeline that generates
novel sequences that are not only prone to aggregate but self-assemble into a
specified fibrillar or spherical morphology. We compiled a new dataset by
leveraging existing aggregation propensity datasets and extracting geometric
and physicochemical isolated peptide descriptors that act as proxies for
aggregate morphology. This dataset is then used to train a Transformer-based
Conditional Variational Autoencoder with a masking mechanism, which generates
novel peptides under arbitrary conditioning. After filtering to ensure design
specifications and validation of generated sequences through coarse-grained
molecular dynamics simulations, PepMorph yielded 83% accuracy in intended
morphology generation, showcasing its promise as a framework for
application-driven peptide discovery.

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: The paper introduces RAMS, a novel sampling strategy for improving physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and neural operators in solving high-dimensional PDEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sampling strategies for solving PDEs via SciML either increase computational costs significantly or lack efficiency for high-dimensional problems.

Method: RAMS moves samples in adversarial gradient directions to maximize PDE residuals, enhancing training efficiency, and integrates seamlessly into existing sampling frameworks.

Result: RAMS demonstrated strong performance in experiments involving high-dimensional PDEs and operator learning tasks, proving its effectiveness.

Conclusion: RAMS is a significant advancement in adaptive sampling methods, offering an efficient solution for operator learning and improving SciML paradigms.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and neural operators, two leading
scientific machine learning (SciML) paradigms, have emerged as powerful tools
for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). Although increasing the
training sample size generally enhances network performance, it also increases
computational costs for physics-informed or data-driven training. To address
this trade-off, different sampling strategies have been developed to sample
more points in regions with high PDE residuals. However, existing sampling
methods are computationally demanding for high-dimensional problems, such as
high-dimensional PDEs or operator learning tasks. Here, we propose a
residual-based adversarial-gradient moving sample (RAMS) method, which moves
samples according to the adversarial gradient direction to maximize the PDE
residual via gradient-based optimization. RAMS can be easily integrated into
existing sampling methods. Extensive experiments, ranging from PINN applied to
high-dimensional PDEs to physics-informed and data-driven operator learning
problems, have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of RAMS.
Notably, RAMS represents the first efficient adaptive sampling approach for
operator learning, marking a significant advancement in the SciML field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the need for more efficient aerodynamic design tools in Formula 1 due to reduced wind tunnel hours and strict budget caps as per FIA regulations.

Method: The authors utilize a PINN framework combining CFD simulation data and physical principles of fluid dynamics (Navier-Stokes equations). A hybrid loss function ensures both data accuracy and adherence to aerodynamic principles.

Result: The model achieves highly accurate predictions for aerodynamic coefficients with R-squared values of 0.968 for drag coefficient and 0.981 for lift coefficient, while significantly cutting down computational time.

Conclusion: The PINN framework provides Formula 1 teams with a robust, quick tool for aerodynamic design exploration, ensuring compliance with new FIA regulations and budgetary limits.

Abstract: In response to recent FIA regulations reducing Formula 1 team wind tunnel
hours (from 320 hours for last-place teams to 200 hours for championship
leaders) and strict budget caps of 135 million USD per year, more efficient
aerodynamic development tools are needed by teams. Conventional computational
fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, though offering high fidelity results,
require large computational resources with typical simulation durations of 8-24
hours per configuration analysis. This article proposes a Physics-Informed
Neural Network (PINN) for the fast prediction of Formula 1 front wing
aerodynamic coefficients. The suggested methodology combines CFD simulation
data from SimScale with first principles of fluid dynamics through a hybrid
loss function that constrains both data fidelity and physical adherence based
on Navier-Stokes equations. Training on force and moment data from 12
aerodynamic features, the PINN model records coefficient of determination
(R-squared) values of 0.968 for drag coefficient and 0.981 for lift coefficient
prediction while lowering computational time. The physics-informed framework
guarantees that predictions remain adherent to fundamental aerodynamic
principles, offering F1 teams an efficient tool for the fast exploration of
design space within regulatory constraints.

TL;DR: This paper presents a non-intrusive, Autoencoder-based framework for reduced-order modeling in continuum mechanics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches to reduced-order modeling often have limitations in accuracy and extensibility. The paper aims to develop a method that simultaneously addresses these challenges in the context of continuum mechanics.

Method: The approach involves three integrated stages: (i) using an unsupervised Autoencoder for data compression, (ii) applying a supervised regression network for mapping problem parameters to latent codes, and (iii) enabling an end-to-end surrogate for reconstructing full-field solutions directly from parameters. Two novel extensions—force-augmented prediction and multi-field capabilities—are introduced.

Result: The framework performs well in nonlinear benchmark problems involving various mechanical conditions, demonstrating high accuracy in reconstructing high-dimensional solutions while remaining non-intrusive.

Conclusion: The paper successfully combines deep learning with dimensionality reduction to create efficient, accurate, and extensible surrogate models, offering utility in various applications such as uncertainty quantification and digital twins.

Abstract: We propose a non-intrusive, Autoencoder-based framework for reduced-order
modeling in continuum mechanics. Our method integrates three stages: (i) an
unsupervised Autoencoder compresses high-dimensional finite element solutions
into a compact latent space, (ii) a supervised regression network maps problem
parameters to latent codes, and (iii) an end-to-end surrogate reconstructs
full-field solutions directly from input parameters.
  To overcome limitations of existing approaches, we propose two key
extensions: a force-augmented variant that jointly predicts displacement fields
and reaction forces at Neumann boundaries, and a multi-field architecture that
enables coupled field predictions, such as in thermo-mechanical systems. The
framework is validated on nonlinear benchmark problems involving heterogeneous
composites, anisotropic elasticity with geometric variation, and
thermo-mechanical coupling. Across all cases, it achieves accurate
reconstructions of high-fidelity solutions while remaining fully non-intrusive.
  These results highlight the potential of combining deep learning with
dimensionality reduction to build efficient and extensible surrogate models.
Our publicly available implementation provides a foundation for integrating
data-driven model order reduction into uncertainty quantification,
optimization, and digital twin applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address resource allocation in distributed systems with heterogeneous communication and computation times, while overcoming constraints from synchronous algorithms.

Method: The researchers propose an Asynchronous Stochastic Primal-Dual (Asyn-PD) algorithm, relying on locally available stochastic gradients and allowing worker-server asynchronicity.

Result: The Asyn-PD algorithm converges to the saddle point solution at a rate of O(1/t), and numerical experiments confirm its advantages over synchronous alternatives.

Conclusion: The study validates the effectiveness and efficiency of the Asyn-PD algorithm for distributed resource allocation tasks in asynchronous environments.

Abstract: This work proposes and studies the distributed resource allocation problem in
asynchronous and stochastic settings. We consider a distributed system with
multiple workers and a coordinating server with heterogeneous computation and
communication times. We explore an approximate stochastic primal-dual approach
with the aim of 1) adhering to the resource budget constraints, 2) allowing for
the asynchronicity between the workers and the server, and 3) relying on the
locally available stochastic gradients. We analyze our Asynchronous stochastic
Primal-Dual (Asyn-PD) algorithm and prove its convergence in the second moment
to the saddle point solution of the approximate problem at the rate of
$O(1/t)$, where $t$ is the iteration number. Furthermore, we verify our
algorithm numerically to validate the analytically derived convergence results,
and demonstrate the advantages of utilizing our asynchronous algorithm rather
than deploying a synchronous algorithm where the server must wait until it gets
update from all workers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Repetitive scenario design problems require efficient determination of the sample size needed to meet risk constraints, but this process can be challenging and time-consuming.

Method: The paper suggests learning the probability density function (pdf) that maps risk levels to sample sizes based on observed data, allowing for on-the-fly adjustments and optimization.

Result: The method is proven theoretically sound, converges to the optimal sample size, and is demonstrated to work effectively on diverse challenging problems, including those with nonconvex constraints and dynamic distributions.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully generalizes existing optimization methods while efficiently addressing diverse and complex repetitive design problems.

Abstract: We consider the problem of repetitive scenario design where one has to solve
repeatedly a scenario design problem and can adjust the sample size (number of
scenarios) to obtain a desired level of risk (constraint violation
probability). We propose an approach to learn on the fly the optimal sample
size based on observed data consisting in previous scenario solutions and their
risk level. Our approach consists in learning a function that represents the
pdf (probability density function) of the risk as a function of the sample
size. Once this function is known, retrieving the optimal sample size is
straightforward. We prove the soundness and convergence of our approach to
obtain the optimal sample size for the class of fixed-complexity scenario
problems, which generalizes fully-supported convex scenario programs that have
been studied extensively in the scenario optimization literature. We also
demonstrate the practical efficiency of our approach on a series of challenging
repetitive scenario design problems, including non-fixed-complexity problems,
nonconvex constraints and time-varying distributions.

Method: The paper proposes QON architectures using Hong-Ou-Mandel and Mach-Zehnder interferometers with phase, amplitude, and intensity modulation. These are implemented as differentiable modules and evaluated using MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets.

Result: HOM-based amplitude modulation and MZ-based phase-shifted modulation configurations achieve comparable or better performance to classical neurons, while intensity-based modulation faces training instabilities.

Conclusion: QONs demonstrate potential as efficient and scalable components for future quantum-inspired neural systems, with specific configurations showing promising convergence and performance.

Abstract: Quantum optical neurons (QONs) are emerging as promising computational units
that leverage photonic interference to perform neural operations in an
energy-efficient and physically grounded manner. Building on recent theoretical
proposals, we introduce a family of QON architectures based on Hong-Ou-Mandel
(HOM) and Mach-Zehnder (MZ) interferometers, incorporating different photon
modulation strategies -- phase, amplitude, and intensity. These physical setups
yield distinct pre-activation functions, which we implement as fully
differentiable modules in software. We evaluate these QONs both in isolation
and as building blocks of multilayer networks, training them on binary and
multiclass image classification tasks using the MNIST and FashionMNIST
datasets. Our experiments show that two configurations -- HOM-based amplitude
modulation and MZ-based phase-shifted modulation -- achieve performance
comparable to that of classical neurons in several settings, and in some cases
exhibit faster or more stable convergence. In contrast, intensity-based
encodings display greater sensitivity to distributional shifts and training
instabilities. These results highlight the potential of QONs as efficient and
scalable components for future quantum-inspired neural architectures and hybrid

Motivation: The motivation is to bridge symbolic AI and neural AI in practical applications, particularly to advance knowledge bases for specialized fields like area studies.

Method: The study exemplifies its semiotic reading by deploying the LaCAS ecosystem and Okapi software to present macro-domains and knowledge objects, while discussing neural tools' integration for enhancing the system's life cycle.

Result: The authors demonstrate an ecosystem for managing 160,000 resources and presenting specialized knowledge efficiently, backed by AI-driven tools and methodologies.

Conclusion: The work suggests the development of specialized agents and methodologies for controlled neural tool integration, ensuring alignment with a symbolic ontology framework for knowledge base enhancement.

Abstract: In a context where the social sciences and humanities are experimenting with
non-anthropocentric analytical frames, this article proposes a semiotic
(structural) reading of the hybridization between symbolic AI and neural (or
sub-symbolic) AI based on a field of application: the design and use of a
knowledge base for area studies. We describe the LaCAS ecosystem -- Open
Archives in Linguistic and Cultural Studies (thesaurus; RDF/OWL ontology; LOD
services; harvesting; expertise; publication), deployed at Inalco (National
Institute for Oriental Languages and Civilizations) in Paris with the Okapi
(Open Knowledge and Annotation Interface) software environment from Ina

resources and ten knowledge macro-domains grouping together several thousand
knowledge objects. We illustrate this approach using the knowledge domain
''Languages of the world'' (~540 languages) and the knowledge object ''Quechua

tools, more specifically generative tools, into the life cycle of a knowledge
base: assistance with data localization/qualification, index extraction and
aggregation, property suggestion and testing, dynamic file generation, and
engineering of contextualized prompts (generic, contextual, explanatory,
adjustment, procedural) aligned with a domain ontology. We outline an ecosystem
of specialized agents capable of animating the database while respecting its
symbolic constraints, by articulating model-driven and data-driven methods.
