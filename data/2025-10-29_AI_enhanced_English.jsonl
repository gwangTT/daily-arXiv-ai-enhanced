We introduce ReCAP (Recursive\nContext-Aware Reasoning and Planning), a hierarchical framework with shared\ncontext for reasoning and planning in LLMs. ReCAP combines three key\nmechanisms: (i) plan-ahead decomposition, in which the model generates a full\nsubtask list, executes the first item, and refines the remainder; (ii)\nstructured re-injection of parent plans, maintaining consistent multi-level\ncontext during recursive return; and (iii) memory-efficient execution, bounding\nthe active prompt so costs scale linearly with task depth. Together these\nmechanisms align high-level goals with low-level actions, reduce redundant\nprompting, and preserve coherent context updates across recursion. Experiments\ndemonstrate that ReCAP substantially improves subgoal alignment and success\nrates on various long-horizon reasoning benchmarks, achieving a 32% gain on\nsynchronous Robotouille and a 29% improvement on asynchronous Robotouille under\nthe strict pass@1 protocol.", "AI": {"tldr": "ReCAP improves reasoning and planning in LLMs for long-horizon tasks with hierarchical framework, showing significant success rate improvements in benchmarks.", "motivation": "To address challenges like context drift, goal loss, and inefficiencies in long-horizon reasoning tasks for LLMs.", "method": "ReCAP uses plan-ahead decomposition, structured re-injection of parent plans, and memory-efficient execution to maintain context alignment and scalable task handling.", "result": "Experiments show ReCAP achieves 32% improvement on synchronous Robotouille and 29% on asynchronous Robotouille under strict pass@1 protocol.", "conclusion": "ReCAP successfully enhances long-horizon reasoning tasks by aligning high-level plans with low-level actions, preserving context, and improving task performance."}}
