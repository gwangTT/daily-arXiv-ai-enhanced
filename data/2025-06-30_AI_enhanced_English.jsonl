To improve the automation of these bidding\nsystems, we adopt generative models, namely the Decision Transformer (DT), to\ntackle the difficulties inherent in automated bidding. Applying the Decision\nTransformer to the auto-bidding task enables a unified approach to sequential\nmodeling, which efficiently overcomes short-sightedness by capturing long-term\ndependencies between past bidding actions and user behavior. Nevertheless,\nconventional DT has certain drawbacks: (1) DT necessitates a preset\nreturn-to-go (RTG) value before generating actions, which is not inherently\nproduced; (2) The policy learned by DT is restricted by its training data,\nwhich is consists of mixed-quality trajectories. To address these challenges,\nwe introduce the R* Decision Transformer (R* DT), developed in a three-step\nprocess: (1) R DT: Similar to traditional DT, R DT stores actions based on\nstate and RTG value, as well as memorizing the RTG for a given state using the\ntraining set; (2) R^ DT: We forecast the highest value (within the training\nset) of RTG for a given state, deriving a suboptimal policy based on the\ncurrent state and the forecasted supreme RTG value; (3) R* DT: Based on R^ DT,\nwe generate trajectories and select those with high rewards (using a simulator)\nto augment our training dataset. This data enhancement has been shown to\nimprove the RTG of trajectories in the training data and gradually leads the\nsuboptimal policy towards optimality. Comprehensive tests on a publicly\navailable bidding dataset validate the R* DT's efficacy and highlight its\nsuperiority when dealing with mixed-quality trajectories.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper introduces the R* Decision Transformer (R* DT) for improving automated bidding in online ad auctions, emphasizing overcoming the limitations of conventional Decision Transformers (DT) and addressing mixed-quality training data.", "motivation": "The paper seeks to improve automated bidding systems in online ad auctions by addressing challenges with conventional Decision Transformers, such as dependence on preset return-to-go values and limitations caused by mixed-quality training data.", "method": "The authors proposed a three-step enhancement to the Decision Transformer: 1) R DT memorizes RTG values from the training set, 2) R^ DT forecasts optimal RTG for better policies, and 3) R* DT enriches the training data by generating and selecting trajectories with high rewards.", "result": "Experiments on a publicly available bidding dataset demonstrate the R* DT's improved performance, particularly in handling mixed-quality trajectories and achieving better automated bidding outcomes.", "conclusion": "The R* DT effectively addresses the shortcomings of conventional DT by optimizing policy learning through data enhancement, showcasing its capability as a more efficient solution for automated bidding challenges in online advertising."}}

At best, scientific knowledge from publications is provided in\ntabular formats, which lack semantic context. A more flexible, structured, and\nsemantic representation is needed to make scientific knowledge understandable\nand processable by both humans and machines. We propose an evolution model of\nknowledge representation, inspired by the 5-star Linked Open Data (LOD) model,\nwith five stages and defined criteria to guide the stepwise transition from a\ndigital artifact, such as a PDF, to a semantic representation integrated in a\nknowledge graph (KG). Based on an exemplary workflow implementing the entire\nmodel, we developed a hybrid approach, called SciMantify, leveraging tabular\nformats of scientific knowledge, e.g., results from secondary studies, to\nsupport its evolving semantification. In the approach, humans and machines\ncollaborate closely by performing semantic annotation tasks (SATs) and refining\nthe results to progressively improve the semantic representation of scientific\nknowledge. We implemented the approach in the Open Research Knowledge Graph\n(ORKG), an established platform for improving the findability, accessibility,\ninteroperability, and reusability of scientific knowledge.

In this paper, we aim to address this issue by leveraging Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) to detect and measure gender bias in passage ranking.\nExisting gender fairness metrics rely on lexical- and frequency-based measures,\nleading to various limitations, e.g., missing subtle gender disparities.\nBuilding on our LLM-based gender bias detection method, we introduce a novel\ngender fairness metric, named Class-wise Weighted Exposure (CWEx), aiming to\naddress existing limitations. To measure the effectiveness of our proposed\nmetric and study LLMs' effectiveness in detecting gender bias, we annotate a\nsubset of the MS MARCO Passage Ranking collection and release our new gender\nbias collection, called MSMGenderBias, to foster future research in this area.\nOur extensive experimental results on various ranking models show that our\nproposed metric offers a more detailed evaluation of fairness compared to\nprevious metrics, with improved alignment to human labels (58.77% for\nGrep-BiasIR, and 18.51% for MSMGenderBias, measured using Cohen's Kappa\nagreement), effectively distinguishing gender bias in ranking. By integrating\nLLM-driven bias detection, an improved fairness metric, and gender bias\nannotations for an established dataset, this work provides a more robust\nframework for analyzing and mitigating bias in IR systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper proposes an LLM-based method and a new fairness metric (CWEx) for detecting and measuring gender bias in passage ranking, releasing a new dataset called MSMGenderBias to improve IR systems.", "motivation": "The paper addresses the limitations in current gender fairness metrics in NLP and IR systems, such as missing subtle gender disparities, and aims to provide a robust approach to detect and evaluate gender bias.", "method": "It introduces an LLM-based gender bias detection method, a novel Class-wise Weighted Exposure (CWEx) metric, and annotates a subset of MS MARCO to create the MSMGenderBias collection.", "result": "The proposed CWEx metric results in better alignment with human labels (achieving a Cohen's Kappa agreement of 58.77% for Grep-BiasIR and 18.51% for MSMGenderBias) compared to previous metrics, enhancing the precision of gender bias detection.", "conclusion": "By integrating LLM-based methods, a novel fairness metric, and annotated data, the paper provides an advanced framework to analyze and mitigate gender bias in IR systems, aiming to foster future research."}}
