### [1] [AI Survival Stories: a Taxonomic Analysis of AI Existential Risk](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09765)
*Herman Cappelen,Simon Goldstein,John Hawthorne*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper creates a framework analyzing AI's existential risks, exploring scenarios where humanity survives based on two major premises about AI's power and potential threat.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper seeks to address growing concerns about existential risks posed by AI systems and understand pathways humanity could take to mitigate those risks.

Method: The authors developed a taxonomy of survival stories based on two premises: (1) AI becomes extremely powerful, and (2) powerful AI destroys humanity. Different survival scenarios are constructed by showing how either of these premises could fail.

Result: The taxonomy identifies various survival scenarios and challenges associated with each, providing insights into different responses to AI-related risks.

Conclusion: Different survival narratives emphasize the importance of focused strategies to either limit AI's power, manage its goals, or ensure proper detection and control mechanisms against potentially harmful systems.

Abstract: Since the release of ChatGPT, there has been a lot of debate about whether AI systems pose an existential risk to humanity. This paper develops a general framework for thinking about the existential risk of AI systems. We analyze a two premise argument that AI systems pose a threat to humanity. Premise one: AI systems will become extremely powerful. Premise two: if AI systems become extremely powerful, they will destroy humanity. We use these two premises to construct a taxonomy of survival stories, in which humanity survives into the far future. In each survival story, one of the two premises fails. Either scientific barriers prevent AI systems from becoming extremely powerful; or humanity bans research into AI systems, thereby preventing them from becoming extremely powerful; or extremely powerful AI systems do not destroy humanity, because their goals prevent them from doing so; or extremely powerful AI systems do not destroy humanity, because we can reliably detect and disable systems that have the goal of doing so. We argue that different survival stories face different challenges. We also argue that different survival stories motivate different responses to the threats from AI. Finally, we use our taxonomy to produce rough estimates of P(doom), the probability that humanity will be destroyed by AI.

### [2] [GUI-Eyes: Tool-Augmented Perception for Visual Grounding in GUI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09770)
*Chen Chen,Jiawei Shao,Dakuan Lu,Haoyi Hu,Xiangcheng Liu,Hantao Yao,Wu Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces GUI-Eyes, an RL framework that uses active visual perception in GUI tasks by leveraging strategic decision-making and targeted tool use, achieving superior accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in GUI automation due to reliance on static visual inputs and passive perception in current methods.

Method: A two-stage RL-based reasoning process where the agent strategically decides on visual tool usage (e.g., zooming, cropping) supported by a progressive perception strategy and spatially continuous reward functions.

Result: GUI-Eyes significantly outperforms baseline methods on grounding accuracy (44.8%) using a limited dataset (3k samples) on the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark.

Conclusion: Tool-aware active perception improves robustness and data efficiency in GUI automation by enabling better reasoning and adaptive observation behaviors.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) and reinforcement learning (RL) have driven progress in GUI automation. However, most existing methods rely on static, one-shot visual inputs and passive perception, lacking the ability to adaptively determine when, whether, and how to observe the interface. We present GUI-Eyes, a reinforcement learning framework for active visual perception in GUI tasks. To acquire more informative observations, the agent learns to make strategic decisions on both whether and how to invoke visual tools, such as cropping or zooming, within a two-stage reasoning process. To support this behavior, we introduce a progressive perception strategy that decomposes decision-making into coarse exploration and fine-grained grounding, coordinated by a two-level policy. In addition, we design a spatially continuous reward function tailored to tool usage, which integrates both location proximity and region overlap to provide dense supervision and alleviate the reward sparsity common in GUI environments. On the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, GUI-Eyes-3B achieves 44.8% grounding accuracy using only 3k labeled samples, significantly outperforming both supervised and RL-based baselines. These results highlight that tool-aware active perception, enabled by staged policy reasoning and fine-grained reward feedback, is critical for building robust and data-efficient GUI agents.

### [3] [PCN-Rec: Agentic Proof-Carrying Negotiation for Reliable Governance-Constrained Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09771)
*Aradhya Dixit,Shreem Dixit*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces PCN-Rec, a pipeline combining governance-compliant recommendations alongside user relevance by leveraging deterministic enforcement and checks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based recommenders are good at generating ranked lists but fail to enforce governance constraints like diversity or long-tail exposure properly and reliably.

Method: PCN-Rec utilizes a pipeline with a base recommender generating candidates, two negotiation agents for relevance and constraints, a mediator LLM synthesizing a slate, and deterministic verifications to ensure compliance.

Result: On MovieLens-100K dataset, PCN-Rec shows a 98.55% pass rate for satisfying constraints while maintaining high utility (minimal drop in NDCG@10).

Conclusion: PCN-Rec effectively achieves governance compliance without significantly compromising recommendation utility, ensuring auditability through deterministic verification and repair mechanisms.

Abstract: Modern LLM-based recommenders can generate compelling ranked lists, but they struggle to reliably satisfy governance constraints such as minimum long-tail exposure or diversity requirements. We present PCN-Rec, a proof-carrying negotiation pipeline that separates natural-language reasoning from deterministic enforcement. A base recommender (MF/CF) produces a candidate window of size W, which is negotiated by two agents: a User Advocate optimizing relevance and a Policy Agent enforcing constraints. A mediator LLM synthesizes a top-N slate together with a structured certificate (JSON) describing the claimed constraint satisfaction. A deterministic verifier recomputes all constraints from the slate and accepts only verifier-checked certificates; if verification fails, a deterministic constrained-greedy repair produces a compliant slate for re-verification, yielding an auditable trace. On MovieLens-100K with governance constraints, PCN-Rec achieves a 98.55% pass rate on feasible users (n = 551, W = 80) versus a one-shot single-LLM baseline without verification/repair, while preserving utility with only a 0.021 absolute drop in NDCG@10 (0.403 vs. 0.424); differences are statistically significant (p < 0.05).

### [4] [Antisocial behavior towards large language model users: experimental evidence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09772)
*Paweł Niszczota,Cassandra Grützner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper examines social reactions to the use of large language models (LLMs) and provides evidence of negative behavioral responses toward individuals relying on LLMs in real-effort tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether negative attitudes toward individuals who use LLMs translate into costly punitive actions.

Method: A two-phase online experiment was conducted with participants destroying earnings of peers who used or did not use LLMs in completing a real-effort task.

Result: Participants punished individuals increased with higher use of LLMs, and suspicion arose over self-reported LLM usage, affecting punishment levels.

Conclusion: LLM efficiency gains are offset by social sanctions, posing implications for their adoption.

Abstract: The rapid spread of large language models (LLMs) has raised concerns about the social reactions they provoke. Prior research documents negative attitudes toward AI users, but it remains unclear whether such disapproval translates into costly action. We address this question in a two-phase online experiment (N = 491 Phase II participants; Phase I provided targets) where participants could spend part of their own endowment to reduce the earnings of peers who had previously completed a real-effort task with or without LLM support. On average, participants destroyed 36% of the earnings of those who relied exclusively on the model, with punishment increasing monotonically with actual LLM use. Disclosure about LLM use created a credibility gap: self-reported null use was punished more harshly than actual null use, suggesting that declarations of "no use" are treated with suspicion. Conversely, at high levels of use, actual reliance on the model was punished more strongly than self-reported reliance. Taken together, these findings provide the first behavioral evidence that the efficiency gains of LLMs come at the cost of social sanctions.

### [5] [Improving Chain-of-Thought for Logical Reasoning via Attention-Aware Intervention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09805)
*Nguyen Minh Phuong,Dang Huu Tien,Naoya Inoue*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study introduces an end-to-end framework for logical reasoning tasks in LLMs and proposes Attention-Aware Intervention (AAI) to improve performance by modulating attention heads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the reliance on complex interactive frameworks or external resources for logical reasoning in language models, aiming for scalability, generalization, and analyzability.

Method: Incorporate structural information into few-shot prompts and employ Attention-Aware Intervention (AAI) to reweight attention scores of selected heads based on logical patterns.

Result: AAI enhances logical reasoning performance across various benchmarks with minimal computational overhead, demonstrating its versatility and efficiency.

Conclusion: AAI provides an efficient solution to improve reasoning in LLMs by steering attention mechanisms, presenting a scalable and robust alternative to traditional methods.

Abstract: Modern logical reasoning with LLMs primarily relies on employing complex interactive frameworks that decompose the reasoning process into subtasks solved through carefully designed prompts or requiring external resources (e.g., symbolic solvers) to exploit their strong logical structures. While interactive approaches introduce additional overhead, hybrid approaches depend on external components, which limit their scalability. A non-interactive, end-to-end framework enables reasoning to emerge within the model itself -- improving generalization while preserving analyzability without any external resources. In this work, we introduce a non-interactive, end-to-end framework for reasoning tasks. We show that introducing structural information into the few-shot prompt activates a subset of attention heads that patterns aligned with logical reasoning operators. Building on this insight, we propose Attention-Aware Intervention (AAI), an inference-time intervention method that reweights attention scores across selected heads identified by their logical patterns. AAI offers an efficient way to steer the model's reasoning toward leveraging prior knowledge through attention modulation. Extensive experiments show that AAI enhances logical reasoning performance across diverse benchmarks and model architectures, while incurring negligible additional computational overhead.

### [6] [Thinking Long, but Short: Stable Sequential Test-Time Scaling for Large Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09855)
*Michael R. Metel,Yufei Cui,Boxing Chen,Prasanna Parthasarathi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Min-Seek, a novel sequential test-time scaling method that stabilizes and improves large reasoning model accuracy without requiring fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Models often face accuracy degradation and instability when induced to extend their reasoning length beyond optimal levels. There is a need for a method to stabilize and enhance accuracy without fine-tuning.

Method: The Min-Seek algorithm stabilizes and improves reasoning accuracy by storing one additional induced thought's KV pairs efficiently with a custom KV cache that dynamically encodes keys without position embeddings, enabling reasoning beyond context length limitations.

Result: Min-Seek significantly enhances model accuracy in a wide range of reasoning tasks while maintaining computational efficiency under mild conditions.

Conclusion: Min-Seek provides an efficient, stable, and scalable method to optimize computational reasoning accuracy without the need for reasoning length fine-tuning.

Abstract: Sequential test-time scaling is a promising training-free method to improve large reasoning model accuracy, but as currently implemented, significant limitations have been observed. Inducing models to think for longer can increase their accuracy, but as the length of reasoning is further extended, it has also been shown to result in accuracy degradation and model instability. This work presents a novel sequential test-time scaling method, Min-Seek, which improves model accuracy significantly over a wide range of induced thoughts, stabilizing the accuracy of sequential scaling, and removing the need for reasoning length fine-tuning. Beyond improving model accuracy over a variety of reasoning tasks, our method is inherently efficient, as only the KV pairs of one additional induced thought are kept in the KV cache during reasoning. With a custom KV cache which stores keys without position embeddings, by dynamically encoding them contiguously before each new generated thought, our method can continue to reason well beyond a model's maximum context length, and under mild conditions has linear computational complexity.

### [7] [A Scoping Review of the Ethical Perspectives on Anthropomorphising Large Language Model-Based Conversational Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09869)
*Andrea Ferrario,Rasita Vinay,Matteo Casserini,Alessandro Facchini*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper reviews and summarizes ethical issues and opportunities in ascribing human characteristics to large language model-based conversational agents (LLM-based CAs) while proposing recommendations for governance and future research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the increasing ethical and practical challenges surrounding anthropomorphisation of LLM-based CAs, especially as these systems gain prominence in society and engage users through human-like traits.

Method: The authors conduct a scoping review across five databases and three preprint repositories, synthesizing literature on anthropomorphising LLM-based CAs by exploring conceptual foundations, ethical aspects, and methodological approaches.

Result: The study finds differing definitions and operationalizations of anthropomorphisation, a risk-focused discourse, and a lack of sufficient empirical studies connecting user interaction to governance guidelines.

Conclusion: A research agenda and recommendations for designing and governing LLM-based CAs using ethical anthropomorphic cues are proposed, acknowledging the need for further empirical studies to address practical challenges.

Abstract: Anthropomorphisation -- the phenomenon whereby non-human entities are ascribed human-like qualities -- has become increasingly salient with the rise of large language model (LLM)-based conversational agents (CAs). Unlike earlier chatbots, LLM-based CAs routinely generate interactional and linguistic cues, such as first-person self-reference, epistemic and affective expressions that empirical work shows can increase engagement. On the other hand, anthropomorphisation raises ethical concerns, including deception, overreliance, and exploitative relationship framing, while some authors argue that anthropomorphic interaction may support autonomy, well-being, and inclusion. Despite increasing interest in the phenomenon, literature remains fragmented across domains and varies substantially in how it defines, operationalizes, and normatively evaluates anthropomorphisation. This scoping review maps ethically oriented work on anthropomorphising LLM-based CAs across five databases and three preprint repositories. We synthesize (1) conceptual foundations, (2) ethical challenges and opportunities, and (3) methodological approaches. We find convergence on attribution-based definitions but substantial divergence in operationalization, a predominantly risk-forward normative framing, and limited empirical work that links observed interaction effects to actionable governance guidance. We conclude with a research agenda and design/governance recommendations for ethically deploying anthropomorphic cues in LLM-based conversational agents.

### [8] [Epistemology gives a Future to Complementarity in Human-AI Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09871)
*Andrea Ferrario,Alessandro Facchini,Juan M. Durán*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Human-AI complementarity is crucial yet challenged by theoretical gaps; this paper reframes it using epistemological concepts to emphasize its role in reliable decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the theoretical challenges and practical limitations of human-AI complementarity in decision-making processes.

Method: Reframing complementarity through epistemological analysis, leveraging computational reliabilism to assess reliability in human-AI interactions.

Result: Complementarity acts as evidence for reliable epistemic processes within human-AI teams, enabling improved calibration of decision-making systems.

Conclusion: Human-AI complementarity's value lies in fostering reliability rather than solely measuring predictive accuracy, aiding practical reasoning in socio-technical contexts.

Abstract: Human-AI complementarity is the claim that a human supported by an AI system can outperform either alone in a decision-making process. Since its introduction in the human-AI interaction literature, it has gained traction by generalizing the reliance paradigm and by offering a more practical alternative to the contested construct of 'trust in AI.' Yet complementarity faces key theoretical challenges: it lacks precise theoretical anchoring, it is formalized just as a post hoc indicator of relative predictive accuracy, it remains silent about other desiderata of human-AI interactions and it abstracts away from the magnitude-cost profile of its performance gain. As a result, complementarity is difficult to obtain in empirical settings. In this work, we leverage epistemology to address these challenges by reframing complementarity within the discourse on justificatory AI. Drawing on computational reliabilism, we argue that historical instances of complementarity function as evidence that a given human-AI interaction is a reliable epistemic process for a given predictive task. Together with other reliability indicators assessing the alignment of the human-AI team with the epistemic standards and socio-technical practices, complementarity contributes to the degree of reliability of human-AI teams when generating predictions. This supports the practical reasoning of those affected by these outputs -- patients, managers, regulators, and others. In summary, our approach suggests that the role and value of complementarity lies not in providing a relative measure of predictive accuracy, but in helping calibrate decision-making to the reliability of AI-supported processes that increasingly shape everyday life.

### [9] [Beyond Rule-Based Workflows: An Information-Flow-Orchestrated Multi-Agents Paradigm via Agent-to-Agent Communication from CORAL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09883)
*Xinxing Ren,Quagmire Zang,Caelum Forder,Suman Deb,Ahsen Tahir,Roman J. Georgio,Peter Carroll,Zekun Guo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel Information-Flow-Orchestrated Multi-Agent Paradigm using flexible agent-to-agent communication, outperforming existing rule-based workflows in a benchmark test.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of workflow-driven Multi-Agent Systems, which involve substantial manual effort and cannot handle the complexity of real-world tasks.

Method: The authors propose a system with a dedicated information flow orchestrator that dynamically coordinates agents via natural language, removing the reliance on predefined workflows.

Result: On the GAIA benchmark, their approach achieved a noteworthy 8.49% improvement in accuracy over the baseline with comparable computational cost.

Conclusion: The proposed paradigm offers enhanced task flexibility, more robust handling of edge cases, and surpasses traditional rule-based workflows in performance.

Abstract: Most existing Large Language Model (LLM)-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) rely on predefined workflows, where human engineers enumerate task states in advance and specify routing rules and contextual injections accordingly. Such workflow-driven designs are essentially rule-based decision trees, which suffer from two fundamental limitations: they require substantial manual effort to anticipate and encode possible task states, and they cannot exhaustively cover the state space of complex real-world tasks. To address these issues, we propose an Information-Flow-Orchestrated Multi-Agent Paradigm via Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Communication from CORAL, in which a dedicated information flow orchestrator continuously monitors task progress and dynamically coordinates other agents through the A2A toolkit using natural language, without relying on predefined workflows. We evaluate our approach on the general-purpose benchmark GAIA, using the representative workflow-based MAS OWL as the baseline while controlling for agent roles and underlying models. Under the pass@1 setting, our method achieves 63.64% accuracy, outperforming OWL's 55.15% by 8.49 percentage points with comparable token consumption. Further case-level analysis shows that our paradigm enables more flexible task monitoring and more robust handling of edge cases. Our implementation is publicly available at: https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/Beyond-Rule-Based-Workflows

### [10] [Continuum Memory Architectures for Long-Horizon LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09913)
*Joe Logan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The Continuum Memory Architecture (CMA) improves upon Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) by enabling dynamic and persistent memory management across interactions, addressing structural limitations in RAG.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of RAG, which treats memory as a stateless lookup table and fails to enable meaningful continuity, updates, or disambiguation across agent interactions.

Method: The CMA framework is proposed, emphasizing persistent storage, selective retention, temporal chaining, associative routing, and consolidation for more cohesive memory management.

Result: CMA demonstrates consistent behavioral advantages, including better performance in knowledge updates, temporal association, associative recall, and contextual disambiguation compared to RAG.

Conclusion: CMA is identified as a critical architecture for enabling long-horizon agents, though challenges such as latency, memory drift, and interpretability remain open for research.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become the default strategy for providing large language model (LLM) agents with contextual knowledge. Yet RAG treats memory as a stateless lookup table: information persists indefinitely, retrieval is read-only, and temporal continuity is absent. We define the \textit{Continuum Memory Architecture} (CMA), a class of systems that maintain and update internal state across interactions through persistent storage, selective retention, associative routing, temporal chaining, and consolidation into higher-order abstractions. Rather than disclosing implementation specifics, we specify the architectural requirements CMA imposes and show consistent behavioral advantages on tasks that expose RAG's structural inability to accumulate, mutate, or disambiguate memory. The empirical probes (knowledge updates, temporal association, associative recall, contextual disambiguation) demonstrate that CMA is a necessary architectural primitive for long-horizon agents while highlighting open challenges around latency, drift, and interpretability.

### [11] [CaMeLs Can Use Computers Too: System-level Security for Computer Use Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09923)
*Hanna Foerster,Robert Mullins,Tom Blanchard,Nicolas Papernot,Kristina Nikolić,Florian Tramèr,Ilia Shumailov,Cheng Zhang,Yiren Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a defense mechanism, Single-Shot Planning, to counter prompt injection attacks in Computer Use Agents by creating execution plans upfront without relying on insecure observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Computer Use Agents are prone to prompt injection attacks, compromising their functionality and potentially leading to security breaches like financial losses. There is a need for robust solutions mitigating this vulnerability.

Method: The authors introduce 'Single-Shot Planning,' where a trusted planner generates a comprehensive execution graph ahead of interacting with potentially untrusted content, ensuring control flow integrity. They also address vulnerabilities like Branch Steering attacks.

Result: The architecture succeeds in preventing instruction injections while performing well against Branch Steering attacks. It retains up to 57% of performance for state-of-the-art models and improves performance of smaller models by up to 19%.

Conclusion: The proposed approach demonstrates that rigorous security measures can coexist with strong utility in Computer Use Agents, offering both protection from injection attacks and retaining effective performance.

Abstract: AI agents are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, where malicious content hijacks agent behavior to steal credentials or cause financial loss. The only known robust defense is architectural isolation that strictly separates trusted task planning from untrusted environment observations. However, applying this design to Computer Use Agents (CUAs) -- systems that automate tasks by viewing screens and executing actions -- presents a fundamental challenge: current agents require continuous observation of UI state to determine each action, conflicting with the isolation required for security. We resolve this tension by demonstrating that UI workflows, while dynamic, are structurally predictable. We introduce Single-Shot Planning for CUAs, where a trusted planner generates a complete execution graph with conditional branches before any observation of potentially malicious content, providing provable control flow integrity guarantees against arbitrary instruction injections. Although this architectural isolation successfully prevents instruction injections, we show that additional measures are needed to prevent Branch Steering attacks, which manipulate UI elements to trigger unintended valid paths within the plan. We evaluate our design on OSWorld, and retain up to 57% of the performance of frontier models while improving performance for smaller open-source models by up to 19%, demonstrating that rigorous security and utility can coexist in CUAs.

### [12] [Hallucination Detection and Mitigation in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09929)
*Ahmad Pesaranghader,Erin Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discusses managing hallucinations in large AI models by creating a framework for continuous improvement via identifying causes and interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to make large AI models (LLMs/LRMs) reliable for critical domains like finance and law, where they often generate misleading content (hallucinations).

Method: The authors present a framework categorizing hallucination sources (model, data, and context) alongside detection and mitigation techniques, demonstrated through a case study in financial data extraction.

Result: The proposed system effectively integrates a feedback loop involving model, context, and data layers, showcasing progressive reliability improvement.

Conclusion: The framework offers a structured, scalable solution for enhancing AI trustworthiness, particularly in high-regulation environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) offer transformative potential for high-stakes domains like finance and law, but their tendency to hallucinate, generating factually incorrect or unsupported content, poses a critical reliability risk. This paper introduces a comprehensive operational framework for hallucination management, built on a continuous improvement cycle driven by root cause awareness. We categorize hallucination sources into model, data, and context-related factors, allowing targeted interventions over generic fixes. The framework integrates multi-faceted detection methods (e.g., uncertainty estimation, reasoning consistency) with stratified mitigation strategies (e.g., knowledge grounding, confidence calibration). We demonstrate its application through a tiered architecture and a financial data extraction case study, where model, context, and data tiers form a closed feedback loop for progressive reliability enhancement. This approach provides a systematic, scalable methodology for building trustworthy generative AI systems in regulated environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces "LabourLawLLM," a specialized large language model for Chinese labor law, and an evaluation benchmark, "LabourLawBench," demonstrating its superior performance compared to general-purpose models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of general-purpose LLMs like GPT-4 in handling labor law tasks requiring precise legal knowledge and contextual reasoning.

Method: The authors developed LabourLawLLM tailored to Chinese labor law and created LabourLawBench with diverse labor-law tasks and an evaluation framework combining objective metrics and subjective assessments.

Result: LabourLawLLM showed consistent performance improvements across various labor law tasks compared to general-purpose and legal-specific models.

Conclusion: This research provides a scalable methodology for building specialized legal LLMs, enhancing the accuracy, reliability, and societal value of AI in legal applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to substantial progress in domain-specific applications, particularly within the legal domain. However, general-purpose models such as GPT-4 often struggle with specialized subdomains that require precise legal knowledge, complex reasoning, and contextual sensitivity. To address these limitations, we present LabourLawLLM, a legal large language model tailored to Chinese labor law. We also introduce LabourLawBench, a comprehensive benchmark covering diverse labor-law tasks, including legal provision citation, knowledge-based question answering, case classification, compensation computation, named entity recognition, and legal case analysis. Our evaluation framework combines objective metrics (e.g., ROUGE-L, accuracy, F1, and soft-F1) with subjective assessment based on GPT-4 scoring. Experiments show that LabourLawLLM consistently outperforms general-purpose and existing legal-specific LLMs across task categories. Beyond labor law, our methodology provides a scalable approach for building specialized LLMs in other legal subfields, improving accuracy, reliability, and societal value of legal AI applications.

### [14] [SPRInG: Continual LLM Personalization via Selective Parametric Adaptation and Retrieval-Interpolated Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09974)
*Seoyeon Kim,Jaehyung Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPRInG, a framework addressing dynamic user preference personalization in large language models with selective updates and adaptive techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: User preferences evolve over time, presenting a challenge for models to adapt without losing prior learned knowledge in dynamic, noisy environments.

Method: SPRInG uses drift-driven selective adaptation with a score function to identify significant preference shifts and employs mechanisms during both training and inference phases to manage personalization effectively.

Result: Experiments on personalized generation benchmarks show that SPRInG performs better than standard baselines, proving its adaptability and reliability.

Conclusion: SPRInG tackles preference drift effectively, offering an innovative solution for continual personalization in dynamic user interaction scenarios.

Abstract: Personalizing Large Language Models typically relies on static retrieval or one-time adaptation, assuming user preferences remain invariant over time. However, real-world interactions are dynamic, where user interests continuously evolve, posing a challenge for models to adapt to preference drift without catastrophic forgetting. Standard continual learning approaches often struggle in this context, as they indiscriminately update on noisy interaction streams, failing to distinguish genuine preference shifts from transient contexts. To address this, we introduce SPRInG, a novel semi-parametric framework designed for effective continual personalization. During training, SPRInG employs drift-driven selective adaptation, which utilizes a likelihood-based scoring function to identify high-novelty interactions. This allows the model to selectively update the user-specific adapter on drift signals while preserving hard-to-learn residuals in a replay buffer. During inference, we apply strict relevance gating and fuse parametric knowledge with retrieved history via logit interpolation. Experiments on the long-form personalized generation benchmark demonstrate that SPRInG outperforms existing baselines, validating its robustness for real-world continual personalization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Memo-SQL introduces a training-free NL2SQL framework that leverages structured decomposition and experience-aware self-correction to address limitations of existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results on BIRD with high efficiency.


<details>

Motivation: The authors aim to overcome the limitations of existing NL2SQL systems, including the lack of historical error-fix learning, inefficient decomposition strategies, and a trade-off between accuracy and computational cost.

Method: Memo-SQL uses structured decomposition (entity-wise, hierarchical, and atomic sequential strategies) and builds a memory of error-fix pairs for retrieval-augmented prompting to dynamically self-correct during SQL generation.

Result: Memo-SQL achieves state-of-the-art execution accuracy of 68.5% on the BIRD dataset while using over 10 times fewer computational resources compared to previous test-time scaling approaches.

Conclusion: Memo-SQL represents a significant step forward in NL2SQL systems, combining efficiency and accuracy without requiring model fine-tuning or external APIs, thus addressing key challenges in the field.

Abstract: Existing NL2SQL systems face two critical limitations: (1) they rely on in-context learning with only correct examples, overlooking the rich signal in historical error-fix pairs that could guide more robust self-correction; and (2) test-time scaling approaches often decompose questions arbitrarily, producing near-identical SQL candidates across runs and diminishing ensemble gains. Moreover, these methods suffer from a stark accuracy-efficiency trade-off: high performance demands excessive computation, while fast variants compromise quality. We present Memo-SQL, a training-free framework that addresses these issues through two simple ideas: structured decomposition and experience-aware self-correction. Instead of leaving decomposition to chance, we apply three clear strategies, entity-wise, hierarchical, and atomic sequential, to encourage diverse reasoning. For correction, we build a dynamic memory of both successful queries and historical error-fix pairs, and use retrieval-augmented prompting to bring relevant examples into context at inference time, no fine-tuning or external APIs required. On BIRD, Memo-SQL achieves 68.5% execution accuracy, setting a new state of the art among open, zero-fine-tuning methods, while using over 10 times fewer resources than prior TTS approaches.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework for integrating Jungian psychological personality types into LLMs, enabling coherent and adaptive human-like personalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether LLMs can demonstrate human-like personality traits that enhance engagement, realism, and decision-making during interactions.

Method: The framework integrates mechanisms for coherent expression (dominant-auxiliary coordination), adaptation (reinforcement-compensation), and long-term evolution (reflection). Personality alignment is evaluated using Myers-Briggs assessments.

Result: Preliminary evaluations reveal that personality-aware LLMs offer context-sensitive, coherent interactions and dynamic adaptability.

Conclusion: Evolving personality-aware LLMs can enable naturalistic, engaging, and adaptive interactions, improving human-computer interfaces.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly shaping human-computer interaction (HCI), from personalized assistants to social simulations. Beyond language competence, researchers are exploring whether LLMs can exhibit human-like characteristics that influence engagement, decision-making, and perceived realism. Personality, in particular, is critical, yet existing approaches often struggle to achieve both nuanced and adaptable expression. We present a framework that models LLM personality via Jungian psychological types, integrating three mechanisms: a dominant-auxiliary coordination mechanism for coherent core expression, a reinforcement-compensation mechanism for temporary adaptation to context, and a reflection mechanism that drives long-term personality evolution. This design allows the agent to maintain nuanced traits while dynamically adjusting to interaction demands and gradually updating its underlying structure. Personality alignment is evaluated using Myers-Briggs Type Indicator questionnaires and tested under diverse challenge scenarios as a preliminary structured assessment. Findings suggest that evolving, personality-aware LLMs can support coherent, context-sensitive interactions, enabling naturalistic agent design in HCI.

*Tingyue Pan,Jie Ouyang,Mingyue Cheng,Qingchuan Li,Zirui Liu,Mingfan Pan,Shuo Yu,Qi Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces PaperScout, an adaptive paper search agent, and a novel training method—Proximal Sequence Policy Optimization (PSPO).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing paper search methods struggle with handling complex, conditional queries in research due to rigid workflows.

Method: They propose PaperScout, an autonomous agent using dynamic decision-making, and PSPO, a sequence-level policy optimization to address training challenges in multi-turn tasks.

Result: PaperScout, boosted by PSPO, consistently achieves better recall and relevance compared to traditional workflow-driven and reinforcement learning methods.

Conclusion: Integrating dynamic decision processes with PSPO presents a significant improvement in academic paper search, showing advantages over conventional methods.

Abstract: Academic paper search is a fundamental task in scientific research, yet most existing approaches rely on rigid, predefined workflows that struggle with complex, conditional queries. To address this limitation, we propose PaperScout, an autonomous agent that reformulates paper search as a sequential decision-making process. Unlike static workflows, PaperScout dynamically decides whether, when, and how to invoke search and expand tools based on accumulated retrieval context. However, training such agents presents a fundamental challenge: standard reinforcement learning methods, typically designed for single-turn tasks, suffer from a granularity mismatch when applied to multi-turn agentic tasks, where token-level optimization diverges from the granularity of sequence-level interactions, leading to noisy credit assignment. We introduce Proximal Sequence Policy Optimization (PSPO), a process-aware, sequence-level policy optimization method that aligns optimization with agent-environment interaction. Comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that PaperScout significantly outperforms strong workflow-driven and RL baselines in both recall and relevance, validating the effectiveness of our adaptive agentic framework and optimization strategy.

TL;DR: FilDeep is a new deep learning framework designed to address the challenges in solving large deformation problems of elastic-plastic solids by utilizing both high-fidelity and low-fidelity datasets effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome the limitations of traditional numerical methods in calculating large deformations in elastic-plastic solids and address the data availability dilemma faced by existing deep learning models.

Method: The FilDeep framework leverages both low-fidelity (more abundant but less accurate) and high-fidelity (scarcer but more accurate) datasets. It incorporates attention-enabled cross-fidelity modules to capture long-range physical interactions in multifidelity data.

Result: FilDeep achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance in experiments and demonstrates efficiency for deployment in manufacturing applications.

Conclusion: FilDeep successfully addresses the issue of data quality and quantity trade-offs in large deformation problems. It shows potential for enhancing computational techniques in manufacturing industries.

Abstract: The scientific computation of large deformations in elastic-plastic solids is crucial in various manufacturing applications. Traditional numerical methods exhibit several inherent limitations, prompting Deep Learning (DL) as a promising alternative. The effectiveness of current DL techniques typically depends on the availability of high-quantity and high-accuracy datasets, which are yet difficult to obtain in large deformation problems. During the dataset construction process, a dilemma stands between data quantity and data accuracy, leading to suboptimal performance in the DL models. To address this challenge, we focus on a representative application of large deformations, the stretch bending problem, and propose FilDeep, a Fidelity-based Deep Learning framework for large Deformation of elastic-plastic solids. Our FilDeep aims to resolve the quantity-accuracy dilemma by simultaneously training with both low-fidelity and high-fidelity data, where the former provides greater quantity but lower accuracy, while the latter offers higher accuracy but in less quantity. In FilDeep, we provide meticulous designs for the practical large deformation problem. Particularly, we propose attention-enabled cross-fidelity modules to effectively capture long-range physical interactions across MF data. To the best of our knowledge, our FilDeep presents the first DL framework for large deformation problems using MF data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our FilDeep consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance and can be efficiently deployed in manufacturing.

TL;DR: This work analyzes large language models (LLMs) use in practice using data from the OpenRouter platform comprising over 100 trillion tokens, revealing insights into adoption, use cases, and user retention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to empirically understand how LLMs are being used in real-world settings to better design and deploy these systems.

Method: The researchers analyzed over 100 trillion LLM interactions from the OpenRouter platform, categorizing use across different dimensions like task type, geography, and user retention.

Result: Key findings include high adoption of open-weight models, dominance of creative roleplay and coding assistance applications, and identification of a 'Glass Slipper' effect in early user retention.

Conclusion: The complexity and diversity of LLM use imply a need for data-driven approaches to inform better development of these models and tools for varied applications.

Abstract: The past year has marked a turning point in the evolution and real-world use of large language models (LLMs). With the release of the first widely adopted reasoning model, o1, on December 5th, 2024, the field shifted from single-pass pattern generation to multi-step deliberation inference, accelerating deployment, experimentation, and new classes of applications. As this shift unfolded at a rapid pace, our empirical understanding of how these models have actually been used in practice has lagged behind. In this work, we leverage the OpenRouter platform, which is an AI inference provider across a wide variety of LLMs, to analyze over 100 trillion tokens of real-world LLM interactions across tasks, geographies, and time. In our empirical study, we observe substantial adoption of open-weight models, the outsized popularity of creative roleplay (beyond just the productivity tasks many assume dominate) and coding assistance categories, plus the rise of agentic inference. Furthermore, our retention analysis identifies foundational cohorts: early users whose engagement persists far longer than later cohorts. We term this phenomenon the Cinderella "Glass Slipper" effect. These findings underscore that the way developers and end-users engage with LLMs "in the wild" is complex and multifaceted. We discuss implications for model builders, AI developers, and infrastructure providers, and outline how a data-driven understanding of usage can inform better design and deployment of LLM systems.

### [20] [MATRIX AS PLAN: Structured Logical Reasoning with Feedback-Driven Replanning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10101)
*Ke Chen,Jiandian Zeng,Zihao Peng,Guo Li,Guangxue Zhang,Tian Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MatrixCoT enhances LLM logical reasoning by introducing a structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) framework with matrix-based planning and feedback mechanisms, improving robustness and interpretability without external solvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face challenges in logical reasoning tasks involving symbolic expressions and strict rules. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting improves reasoning but lacks rigor, and neuro-symbolic methods, though precise, are brittle. Thus, there is a need for structured representations overcoming these limitations while enhancing comprehension and reasoning.

Method: MatrixCoT introduces a normalized and typed approach to natural language, incorporates explicit citation fields, and applies a matrix-based planning method. It preserves the global relations in reasoning steps, produces verifiable artifacts, and implements feedback-driven replanning to ensure correctness.

Result: Experiments across five logical-reasoning benchmarks and five LLMs demonstrate that MatrixCoT significantly enhances robustness, interpretability, and performance in symbolic reasoning tasks without external solvers.

Conclusion: MatrixCoT addresses the weaknesses of existing approaches by providing a structured framework that stabilizes logical reasoning and improves error correction. It achieves competitive performance while enhancing capabilities such as robustness and trustworthiness in reasoning tasks.

Abstract: As knowledge and semantics on the web grow increasingly complex, enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) comprehension and reasoning capabilities has become particularly important. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. However, it still falls short on logical reasoning tasks that rely on symbolic expressions and strict deductive rules. Neuro-symbolic methods address this gap by enforcing formal correctness through external solvers. Yet these solvers are highly format-sensitive, and small instabilities in model outputs can lead to frequent processing failures. LLM-driven approaches avoid parsing brittleness, but they lack structured representations and process-level error-correction mechanisms. To further enhance the logical reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we propose MatrixCoT, a structured CoT framework with a matrix-based plan. Specifically, we normalize and type natural language expressions, attach explicit citation fields, and introduce a matrix-based planning method to preserve global relations among steps. The plan becomes a verifiable artifact, making execution more stable. For verification, we also add a feedback-driven replanning mechanism. Under semantic-equivalence constraints, it identifies omissions and defects, rewrites and compresses the dependency matrix, and produces a more trustworthy final answer. Experiments on five logical-reasoning benchmarks and five LLMs show that, without relying on external solvers, MatrixCoT enhances both robustness and interpretability when tackling complex symbolic reasoning tasks, while maintaining competitive performance.

*Cheng Feng,Chaoliang Zhong,Jun Sun,Yusuke Oishi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces methods that enhance small language models to match or exceed the capabilities of larger models in domain-specific tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying large language models for domain-specific tasks is challenging due to their size, and student-teacher model distillation often results in performance gaps.

Method: The paper introduces a theoretical framework emphasizing Student-Favored Subdomain advantage and proposes Scheduled Checkpoint Distillation (SCD) along with Adaptive Weighting (AW) to enhance student model performance during distillation.

Result: Experiments on tasks like QA, NER, and text classification in multiple languages demonstrate the proposed method's superiority over existing distillation approaches, allowing student models to surpass fine-tuned large models.

Conclusion: Small student models can be optimized to outperform larger fine-tuned models on specific domain tasks through targeted distillation techniques like SCD and AW.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are challenging to deploy for domain-specific tasks due to their massive scale. While distilling a fine-tuned LLM into a smaller student model is a promising alternative, the capacity gap between teacher and student often leads to suboptimal performance. This raises a key question: when and how can a student model match or even surpass its teacher on domain-specific tasks? In this work, we propose a novel theoretical insight: a student can outperform its teacher if its advantage on a Student-Favored Subdomain (SFS) outweighs its deficit on the Teacher-Favored Subdomain (TFS). Guided by this insight, we propose Scheduled Checkpoint Distillation (SCD), which reduces the TFS deficit by emulating the teacher's convergence process during supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the domain task, and a sample-wise Adaptive Weighting (AW) mechanism to preserve student strengths on SFS. Experiments across diverse domain tasks--including QA, NER, and text classification in multiple languages--show that our method consistently outperforms existing distillation approaches, allowing the student model to match or even exceed the performance of its fine-tuned teacher.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MolGen is a molecular generation framework leveraging fragments and combining retrieval-augmented reasoning and reinforcement learning for precise multi-objective property control, significantly outperforming prior models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in generating molecules with precise numeric constraints across multiple physicochemical properties, which traditional LLMs struggle with.

Method: MolGen utilizes a two-stage framework: Stage I involves prototype generation through retrieval-anchored fragment edits, and Stage II employs RL-based optimization using Group Relative Policy Optimization for fine-grained adjustments.

Result: Experimental validation shows MolGen achieves higher validity and better adherence to multi-property constraints compared to strong LLMs and graph-based algorithms.

Conclusion: MolGen effectively combines fragment-level reasoning with controlled refinement, introducing new capabilities for molecule generation under complex multi-objective constraints.

Abstract: Generating molecules that satisfy precise numeric constraints over multiple physicochemical properties is critical and challenging. Although large language models (LLMs) are expressive, they struggle with precise multi-objective control and numeric reasoning without external structure and feedback. We introduce \textbf{M olGen}, a fragment-level, retrieval-augmented, two-stage framework for molecule generation under multi-property constraints. Stage I : Prototype generation: a multi-agent reasoner performs retrieval-anchored, fragment-level edits to produce a candidate near the feasible region. Stage II : RL-based fine-grained optimization: a fragment-level optimizer trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) applies one- or multi-hop refinements to explicitly minimize the property errors toward our target while regulating edit complexity and deviation from the prototype. A large, automatically curated dataset with reasoning chains of fragment edits and measured property deltas underpins both stages, enabling deterministic, reproducible supervision and controllable multi-hop reasoning. Unlike prior work, our framework better reasons about molecules by leveraging fragments and supports controllable refinement toward numeric targets. Experiments on generation under two sets of property constraints (QED, LogP, Molecular Weight and HOMO, LUMO) show consistent gains in validity and precise satisfaction of multi-property targets, outperforming strong LLMs and graph-based algorithms.

TL;DR: LLMs display limited ability to infer temporal structures and predict time intervals between repeated actions. They outperform statistical baselines but fall short of specialized machine-learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate whether LLMs can predict intervals between recurring actions and understand the effects of context on their predictive behavior.

Method: Benchmarking LLMs in zero-shot settings against statistical and machine-learning models in a repurchase scenario with varying contextual information levels.

Result: LLMs outperformed basic statistical models but were unable to compete with specialized machine-learning models. Adding context moderately improves accuracy but excessive context worsens performance.

Conclusion: LLMs are ill-equipped for quantitative temporal inference. Hybrid models combining statistical precision with linguistic flexibility may improve structured temporal reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in reasoning and prediction across different domains. Yet, their ability to infer temporal regularities from structured behavioral data remains underexplored. This paper presents a systematic study investigating whether LLMs can predict time intervals between recurring user actions, such as repeated purchases, and how different levels of contextual information shape their predictive behavior. Using a simple but representative repurchase scenario, we benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs in zero-shot settings against both statistical and machine-learning models. Two key findings emerge. First, while LLMs surpass lightweight statistical baselines, they consistently underperform dedicated machine-learning models, showing their limited ability to capture quantitative temporal structure. Second, although moderate context can improve LLM accuracy, adding further user-level detail degrades performance. These results challenge the assumption that "more context leads to better reasoning". Our study highlights fundamental limitations of today's LLMs in structured temporal inference and offers guidance for designing future context-aware hybrid models that integrate statistical precision with linguistic flexibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenge of poor generalization in dynamic markets caused by models being trained on static historical data and addressing the non-static nature of financial data.

Method: The paper introduces a drift-aware system combining parameterized data manipulation (transformations, mix-ups, curations) with a bi-level optimization-based adaptive planner-scheduler in a differentiable framework.

Result: Extensive experiments show improved model robustness and better risk-adjusted returns for forecasting and trading tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed system presents a generalized, adaptive solution for data-driven systems in finance, enabling better data management and learning-guided automation in dynamic markets.

Abstract: In quantitative finance, the gap between training and real-world performance-driven by concept drift and distributional non-stationarity-remains a critical obstacle for building reliable data-driven systems. Models trained on static historical data often overfit, resulting in poor generalization in dynamic markets. The mantra "History Is Not Enough" underscores the need for adaptive data generation that learns to evolve with the market rather than relying solely on past observations. We present a drift-aware dataflow system that integrates machine learning-based adaptive control into the data curation process. The system couples a parameterized data manipulation module comprising single-stock transformations, multi-stock mix-ups, and curation operations, with an adaptive planner-scheduler that employs gradient-based bi-level optimization to control the system. This design unifies data augmentation, curriculum learning, and data workflow management under a single differentiable framework, enabling provenance-aware replay and continuous data quality monitoring. Extensive experiments on forecasting and reinforcement learning trading tasks demonstrate that our framework enhances model robustness and improves risk-adjusted returns. The system provides a generalizable approach to adaptive data management and learning-guided workflow automation for financial data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the performance of long-horizon sequential decision-making tasks by leveraging LLMs, inspired by their success in reasoning and the shared Transformer foundation with Decision Transformer (DT).

Method: The authors propose treating trajectories as a distinct modality and align trajectory data with task descriptions in natural language. They introduce DecisionLLM, an autoregressive framework that learns to predict decisions using scaling laws based on model scale, data volume, and data quality.

Result: DecisionLLM demonstrates strong performance in benchmarks. DecisionLLM-3B surpasses traditional DT with substantial improvements: 69.4 on Maze2D umaze-v1 and 0.085 on AuctionNet.

Conclusion: DecisionLLM extends capabilities in sequential decision-making and the AIGB paradigm, showcasing potential for future research in online bidding scenarios.

Abstract: Long-sequence decision-making, which is usually addressed through reinforcement learning (RL), is a critical component for optimizing strategic operations in dynamic environments, such as real-time bidding in computational advertising. The Decision Transformer (DT) introduced a powerful paradigm by framing RL as an autoregressive sequence modeling problem. Concurrently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in complex reasoning and planning tasks. This inspires us whether LLMs, which share the same Transformer foundation, but operate at a much larger scale, can unlock new levels of performance in long-horizon sequential decision-making problem. This work investigates the application of LLMs to offline decision making tasks. A fundamental challenge in this domain is the LLMs' inherent inability to interpret continuous values, as they lack a native understanding of numerical magnitude and order when values are represented as text strings. To address this, we propose treating trajectories as a distinct modality. By learning to align trajectory data with natural language task descriptions, our model can autoregressively predict future decisions within a cohesive framework we term DecisionLLM. We establish a set of scaling laws governing this paradigm, demonstrating that performance hinges on three factors: model scale, data volume, and data quality. In offline experimental benchmarks and bidding scenarios, DecisionLLM achieves strong performance. Specifically, DecisionLLM-3B outperforms the traditional Decision Transformer (DT) by 69.4 on Maze2D umaze-v1 and by 0.085 on AuctionNet. It extends the AIGB paradigm and points to promising directions for future exploration in online bidding.

TL;DR: The paper proposes MMPG, a method using Graph Neural Networks with multi-perspective graph construction and Mixture of Experts for better protein representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GNN-based Protein Representation Learning methods capture partial residue interaction properties, limiting representation quality.

Method: MMPG constructs graphs from physical, chemical, and geometric perspectives and employs Mixture of Experts to adaptively fuse features, capturing both perspective-specific and interaction synergies.

Result: MMPG produces enhanced protein representations, verified across four downstream protein tasks.

Conclusion: MMPG addresses limitations of single-perspective methods, leveraging multi-perspective graphs and expert specialization for improved PRL performance.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely adopted for Protein Representation Learning (PRL), as residue interaction networks can be naturally represented as graphs. Current GNN-based PRL methods typically rely on single-perspective graph construction strategies, which capture partial properties of residue interactions, resulting in incomplete protein representations. To address this limitation, we propose MMPG, a framework that constructs protein graphs from multiple perspectives and adaptively fuses them via Mixture of Experts (MoE) for PRL. MMPG constructs graphs from physical, chemical, and geometric perspectives to characterize different properties of residue interactions. To capture both perspective-specific features and their synergies, we develop an MoE module, which dynamically routes perspectives to specialized experts, where experts learn intrinsic features and cross-perspective interactions. We quantitatively verify that MoE automatically specializes experts in modeling distinct levels of interaction from individual representations, to pairwise inter-perspective synergies, and ultimately to a global consensus across all perspectives. Through integrating this multi-level information, MMPG produces superior protein representations and achieves advanced performance on four different downstream protein tasks.

TL;DR: The paper explores how neural agents use compositional generalization to describe unseen images through a two-step method called 'Composition through Decomposition.'


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans can systematically combine known concepts into new ones due to compositionality, and the study aims to replicate this ability in artificial neural agents for better generalization.

Method: The two-step method includes: 1) 'Decompose' - agents learn to break down images into elementary concepts via a codebook and coordination game, and 2) 'Compose' - agents use the codebook to describe novel images by combining these concepts.

Result: Agents could describe unseen images using compositional methods, achieving zero-shot generalization without further training in some instances.

Conclusion: The findings show the effectiveness of 'Composition through Decomposition' for enabling neural agents to achieve compositional generalization, bridging gaps between human-like cognition and machine learning.

Abstract: Compositionality is a cognitive mechanism that allows humans to systematically combine known concepts in novel ways. This study demonstrates how artificial neural agents acquire and utilize compositional generalization to describe previously unseen images. Our method, termed "Composition through Decomposition", involves two sequential training steps. In the 'Decompose' step, the agents learn to decompose an image into basic concepts using a codebook acquired during interaction in a multi-target coordination game. Subsequently, in the 'Compose' step, the agents employ this codebook to describe novel images by composing basic concepts into complex phrases. Remarkably, we observe cases where generalization in the `Compose' step is achieved zero-shot, without the need for additional training.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a workflow to evaluate the impact of downsampling on needle electromyography (nEMG) signals for neuromuscular disease classification, aiming to balance diagnostic performance and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current feature-based machine-learning models for diagnosing neuromuscular diseases face computational challenges due to high and heterogeneous sampling rates of nEMG signals, making near real-time analysis difficult.

Method: The study introduces a workflow combining shape-based distortion metrics, classification outcomes, and feature space analysis to systematically assess downsampling's impact in preserving waveform integrity and predictive performance.

Result: Shape-aware downsampling algorithms are shown to outperform standard decimation methods, preserving diagnostic information while significantly reducing computational demands. A three-class NMD classification task confirms the workflow's viability.

Conclusion: The workflow offers practical guidance for downsampling configurations, enabling efficient nEMG analysis in near real-time and providing a generalizable framework for similar high-frequency time-series applications.

Abstract: Automated analysis of needle electromyography (nEMG) signals is emerging as a tool to support the detection of neuromuscular diseases (NMDs), yet the signals' high and heterogeneous sampling rates pose substantial computational challenges for feature-based machine-learning models, particularly for near real-time analysis. Downsampling offers a potential solution, but its impact on diagnostic signal content and classification performance remains insufficiently understood. This study presents a workflow for systematically evaluating information loss caused by downsampling in high-frequency time series. The workflow combines shape-based distortion metrics with classification outcomes from available feature-based machine learning models and feature space analysis to quantify how different downsampling algorithms and factors affect both waveform integrity and predictive performance. We use a three-class NMD classification task to experimentally evaluate the workflow. We demonstrate how the workflow identifies downsampling configurations that preserve diagnostic information while substantially reducing computational load. Analysis of shape-based distortion metrics showed that shape-aware downsampling algorithms outperform standard decimation, as they better preserve peak structure and overall signal morphology. The results provide practical guidance for selecting downsampling configurations that enable near real-time nEMG analysis and highlight a generalisable workflow that can be used to balance data reduction with model performance in other high-frequency time-series applications as well.

*Jiujiu Chen,Weijun Zeng,Shaofeng Hu,Sihong Xie,Hui Xiong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes GFM4GA, a graph foundation model for group anomaly detection using dual-level contrastive learning and few-shot settings, achieving superior results over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of existing Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) that cannot detect group anomalies, which require analyzing the group as a whole rather than individual-level patterns.

Method: The proposed method, GFM4GA, utilizes dual-level contrastive learning during pretraining to capture group anomaly patterns and feature inconsistencies. During fine-tuning, it incorporates parameter-constrained few-shot learning and weighted mechanisms to adapt to novel group anomalies.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that GFM4GA outperforms existing group anomaly detectors and GFMs for individual anomalies, with a 2.85% improvement in AUROC and a 2.55% increase in AUPRC on average.

Conclusion: GFM4GA effectively detects group anomalies, overcoming the limitations of existing GFMs. It demonstrates adaptability to unseen anomalies and provides robust results in network applications.

Abstract: Group anomaly detection is crucial in many network applications, but faces challenges due to diverse anomaly patterns. Motivated by the success of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing, graph foundation models (GFMs) is proposed to handle few-shot learning task with fewer labeling efforts. GFMs have been successfully applied to detection of individual anomalies but cannot be generalized to group anomalies, as group anomaly patterns must be detected as a whole and individuals in an abnormal group can look rather normal. Therefore, we propose GFM4GA, a novel graph foundation model for group anomaly detection. The pipeline is pretrained via dual-level contrastive learning based on feature-based estimation and group extraction, to capture potential group anomaly structure and feature inconsistencies. In the downstream tasks, the pipeline is finetuned in parameter-constrained and group-anomaly-proportion weighted few-shot settings, and its adaptive ability to unseen group anomalies expanded via group contexts determined by labeled anomaly neighbors. Experiments show that GFM4GA surpasses group anomaly detectors and GFMs for individual anomalies, achieving average improvements of 2.85% in AUROC and 2.55% in AUPRC.

*Alex Dantart,Marco Kóvacs-Navarro*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Topo-RAG, a retrieval framework that maintains the structure of complex enterprise data, achieving substantial improvements over linearization-based RAG systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current linearization-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems fail to adequately handle the inherent complexity of enterprise datasets that mix text and structured data, leading to information loss.

Method: Topo-RAG proposes a dual architecture, treating narratives with dense retrievers and tabular data with a Cell-Aware Late Interaction mechanism, preserving data topology.

Result: The approach improves retrieval performance on complex queries by 18.4% in nDCG@10 on the synthetic enterprise corpus, SEC-25, outperforming standard methods.

Conclusion: Topo-RAG provides a more effective framework for handling hybrid text-tabular datasets, enhancing both search precision and understanding of data structure.

Abstract: In enterprise datasets, documents are rarely pure. They are not just text, nor just numbers; they are a complex amalgam of narrative and structure. Current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have attempted to address this complexity with a blunt tool: linearization. We convert rich, multidimensional tables into simple Markdown-style text strings, hoping that an embedding model will capture the geometry of a spreadsheet in a single vector. But it has already been shown that this is mathematically insufficient.
  This work presents Topo-RAG, a framework that challenges the assumption that "everything is text". We propose a dual architecture that respects the topology of the data: we route fluid narrative through traditional dense retrievers, while tabular structures are processed by a Cell-Aware Late Interaction mechanism, preserving their spatial relationships. Evaluated on SEC-25, a synthetic enterprise corpus that mimics real-world complexity, Topo-RAG demonstrates an 18.4% improvement in nDCG@10 on hybrid queries compared to standard linearization approaches. It's not just about searching better; it's about understanding the shape of information.

*Vansh Kapoor,Aman Gupta,Hao Chen,Anurag Beniwal,Jing Huang,Aviral Kumar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TRIM improves efficiency in multi-step reasoning tasks by routing critical reasoning steps to stronger models, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address cascading failures in multi-step reasoning tasks, where a single incorrect step disrupts the entire solution.

Method: Proposed TRIM, a targeted routing strategy that assigns critical reasoning steps to stronger models using step-level evaluation of uncertainty and costs.

Result: TRIM achieves 5-6x higher cost efficiency on benchmarks like MATH-500 and AIME, maintaining or surpassing performance of stronger models.

Conclusion: Step-level targeted interventions in multi-step reasoning improve cost efficiency and accuracy, enabling scalable and effective reasoning solutions.

Abstract: Multi-step reasoning tasks like mathematical problem solving are vulnerable to cascading failures, where a single incorrect step leads to complete solution breakdown. Current LLM routing methods assign entire queries to one model, treating all reasoning steps as equal. We propose TRIM (Targeted routing in multi-step reasoning tasks), which routes only critical steps$\unicode{x2013}$those likely to derail the solution$\unicode{x2013}$to larger models while letting smaller models handle routine continuations. Our key insight is that targeted step-level interventions can fundamentally transform inference efficiency by confining expensive calls to precisely those steps where stronger models prevent cascading errors. TRIM operates at the step-level: it uses process reward models to identify erroneous steps and makes routing decisions based on step-level uncertainty and budget constraints. We develop several routing strategies within TRIM, ranging from a simple threshold-based policy to more expressive policies that reason about long-horizon accuracy-cost trade-offs and uncertainty in step-level correctness estimates. On MATH-500, even the simplest thresholding strategy surpasses prior routing methods with 5x higher cost efficiency, while more advanced policies match the strong, expensive model's performance using 80% fewer expensive model tokens. On harder benchmarks such as AIME, TRIM achieves up to 6x higher cost efficiency. All methods generalize effectively across math reasoning tasks, demonstrating that step-level difficulty represents fundamental characteristics of reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NoReGeo introduces a benchmark to assess LLMs' intrinsic geometric understanding, independent of reasoning or algebra.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' native spatial and geometric comprehension.

Method: Developed a dataset of 2,500 simple geometric problems across 25 categories solvable by innate geometric understanding.

Result: Tested state-of-the-art models like GPT-4, achieving only 65% accuracy, indicating a gap in spatial understanding.

Conclusion: Current LLMs lack intrinsic geometric cognition; specialized training approaches are necessary.

Abstract: We present NoReGeo, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the intrinsic geometric understanding of large language models (LLMs) without relying on reasoning or algebraic computation. Unlike existing benchmarks that primarily assess models' proficiency in reasoning-based geometry-where solutions are derived using algebraic methods-NoReGeo focuses on evaluating whether LLMs can inherently encode spatial relationships and recognize geometric properties directly. Our benchmark comprises 2,500 trivial geometric problems spanning 25 categories, each carefully crafted to be solvable purely through native geometric understanding, assuming known object locations. We assess a range of state-of-the-art models on NoReGeo, including frontier models like GPT-4, observing that even the most advanced systems achieve an overall maximum of 65% accuracy in binary classification tasks. Further, our ablation experiments demonstrate that such geometric understanding does not emerge through fine-tuning alone, indicating that effective training for geometric comprehension requires a specialized approach from the outset. Our findings highlight a significant gap in current LLMs' ability to natively grasp geometric concepts, providing a foundation for future research toward models with true geometric cognition.

*Xin Guan,Zijian Li,Shen Huang,Pengjun Xie,Jingren Zhou,Jiuxin Cao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces EAPO, a reinforcement learning approach designed to improve evidence retrieval in long-context reasoning tasks, addressing the challenge of sparse outcome rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to solve the problem of ungrounded 'lucky guesses' in long-context reasoning by ensuring a supervised process for precise evidence retrieval.

Method: The authors propose the EAPO framework, which computes dense evidence rewards using a reward model and incorporates an Adaptive Reward-Policy Co-Evolution mechanism for sharpening the reward model during training.

Result: EAPO achieves significant improvements in long-context reasoning tasks across eight benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: EAPO effectively addresses the sparse reward problem in long-context reasoning by improving evidence extraction and process supervision, demonstrating its utility over existing methods.

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has advanced LLM reasoning, applying it to long-context scenarios is hindered by sparsity of outcome rewards. This limitation fails to penalize ungrounded "lucky guesses," leaving the critical process of needle-in-a-haystack evidence retrieval largely unsupervised. To address this, we propose EAPO (Evidence-Augmented Policy Optimization). We first establish the Evidence-Augmented Reasoning paradigm, validating via Tree-Structured Evidence Sampling that precise evidence extraction is the decisive bottleneck for long-context reasoning. Guided by this insight, EAPO introduces a specialized RL algorithm where a reward model computes a Group-Relative Evidence Reward, providing dense process supervision to explicitly improve evidence quality. To sustain accurate supervision throughout training, we further incorporate an Adaptive Reward-Policy Co-Evolution mechanism. This mechanism iteratively refines the reward model using outcome-consistent rollouts, sharpening its discriminative capability to ensure precise process guidance. Comprehensive evaluations across eight benchmarks demonstrate that EAPO significantly enhances long-context reasoning performance compared to SOTA baselines.

*Cheng Lin Cheng,Ting Chuan Lin,Chai Kai Chang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes C-GRASP, an AI pipeline enhancing HRV-based emotion classification by addressing common physiological hallucinations through individualized reasoning steps and guardrails.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges in using Large Language Models (LLMs) for HRV interpretation, which suffer from physiological issues such as RSA contamination, instability in nonlinear metrics, and neglect of individualized baselines.

Method: C-GRASP is a RAG-enhanced pipeline that applies eight traceable reasoning steps, enforcing Z-score prioritization, constructing RSA-aware guardrails, and utilizing individualized Delta Z-score modules in the HRV analysis.

Result: C-GRASP achieved 37.3% accuracy in 4-class emotion classification and a Clinical Reasoning Consistency (CRC) score of 69.6% in evaluations using the DREAMER dataset. Ablation studies further validate the system's performance.

Conclusion: C-GRASP enhances transparency in affective computing by using evidence-based reasoning, mitigating population biases, and ensuring clinical decision support for safer AI applications in biomedical engineering.

Abstract: Heart rate variability (HRV) is a pivotal noninvasive marker for autonomic monitoring; however, applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to HRV interpretation is hindered by physiological hallucinations. These include respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) contamination, short-data instability in nonlinear metrics, and the neglect of individualized baselines in favor of population norms. We propose C-GRASP (Clinically-Grounded Reasoning for Affective Signal Processing), a guardrailed RAG-enhanced pipeline that decomposes HRV interpretation into eight traceable reasoning steps. Central to C-GRASP is a Z-score Priority Hierarchy that enforces the weighting of individualized baseline shifts over normative statistics. The system effectively mitigates spectral hallucinations through automated RSA-aware guardrails, preventing contamination of frequency-domain indices. Evaluated on 414 trials from the DREAMER dataset, C-GRASP integrated with high-scale reasoning models (e.g., MedGemma3-thinking) achieved superior performance in 4-class emotion classification (37.3% accuracy) and a Clinical Reasoning Consistency (CRC) score of 69.6%. Ablation studies confirm that the individualized Delta Z-score module serves as the critical logical anchor, preventing the "population bias" common in native LLMs. Ultimately, C-GRASP transitions affective computing from black-box classification to transparent, evidence-based clinical decision support, paving the way for safer AI integration in biomedical engineering.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LatentRefusal introduces a safe refusal mechanism for text-to-SQL systems to identify unanswerable queries before generating incorrect results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the deployment safety of text-to-SQL systems by addressing the challenge of unanswerable and underspecified user queries.

Method: The method involves predicting query answerability using intermediate hidden signals in large language models, supported by a proposed Tri-Residual Gated Encoder architecture.

Result: LatentRefusal achieves high effectiveness in detecting unanswerable queries across multiple benchmarks, improving average F1 to 88.5%.

Conclusion: LatentRefusal provides an efficient and attachable safety layer for text-to-SQL systems, reducing risks from unanswerable queries with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: In LLM-based text-to-SQL systems, unanswerable and underspecified user queries may generate not only incorrect text but also executable programs that yield misleading results or violate safety constraints, posing a major barrier to safe deployment. Existing refusal strategies for such queries either rely on output-level instruction following, which is brittle due to model hallucinations, or estimate output uncertainty, which adds complexity and overhead. To address this challenge, we formalize safe refusal in text-to-SQL systems as an answerability-gating problem and propose LatentRefusal, a latent-signal refusal mechanism that predicts query answerability from intermediate hidden activations of a large language model. We introduce the Tri-Residual Gated Encoder, a lightweight probing architecture, to suppress schema noise and amplify sparse, localized cues of question-schema mismatch that indicate unanswerability. Extensive empirical evaluations across diverse ambiguous and unanswerable settings, together with ablation studies and interpretability analyses, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and show that LatentRefusal provides an attachable and efficient safety layer for text-to-SQL systems. Across four benchmarks, LatentRefusal improves average F1 to 88.5 percent on both backbones while adding approximately 2 milliseconds of probe overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the inability of current AI models, like LLMs, to handle ultra-long-horizon tasks and consolidate sparse feedback into cohesive long-term strategies.

Method: The authors developed ML-Master 2.0 using Hierarchical Cognitive Caching (HCC), a multi-tiered framework inspired by computer systems, which organizes knowledge over time, separating immediate execution from experimental strategy.

Result: ML-Master 2.0 achieved a state-of-the-art performance with a medal rate of 56.44% in OpenAI's MLE-Bench under 24-hour evaluation budgets.

Conclusion: Ultra-long-horizon autonomy through advanced context management allows AI systems to achieve groundbreaking autonomy and exploration in complex scientific discovery.

Abstract: The advancement of artificial intelligence toward agentic science is currently bottlenecked by the challenge of ultra-long-horizon autonomy, the ability to sustain strategic coherence and iterative correction over experimental cycles spanning days or weeks. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated prowess in short-horizon reasoning, they are easily overwhelmed by execution details in the high-dimensional, delayed-feedback environments of real-world research, failing to consolidate sparse feedback into coherent long-term guidance. Here, we present ML-Master 2.0, an autonomous agent that masters ultra-long-horizon machine learning engineering (MLE) which is a representative microcosm of scientific discovery. By reframing context management as a process of cognitive accumulation, our approach introduces Hierarchical Cognitive Caching (HCC), a multi-tiered architecture inspired by computer systems that enables the structural differentiation of experience over time. By dynamically distilling transient execution traces into stable knowledge and cross-task wisdom, HCC allows agents to decouple immediate execution from long-term experimental strategy, effectively overcoming the scaling limits of static context windows. In evaluations on OpenAI's MLE-Bench under 24-hour budgets, ML-Master 2.0 achieves a state-of-the-art medal rate of 56.44%. Our findings demonstrate that ultra-long-horizon autonomy provides a scalable blueprint for AI capable of autonomous exploration beyond human-precedent complexities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ErrEval proposes an error-aware evaluation framework for assessing automatic question generation by explicitly identifying and categorizing errors to avoid overestimations and improve alignment with human judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods for automatic question generation neglect critical defects such as factual inaccuracies and mismatched answers, leading to inflated assessments of question quality.

Method: ErrEval uses a two-stage process: first, it employs an Error Identifier to detect and categorize structural, linguistic, and content errors; second, it guides large language model evaluators with these diagnostic signals for grounded scoring.

Result: ErrEval demonstrated improved alignment with human judgments across three benchmarks, addressing overestimation issues in low-quality questions.

Conclusion: Explicit error diagnostics in evaluation frameworks like ErrEval provide more accurate and reliable assessments for automatic question generation compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Automatic Question Generation (QG) often produces outputs with critical defects, such as factual hallucinations and answer mismatches. However, existing evaluation methods, including LLM-based evaluators, mainly adopt a black-box and holistic paradigm without explicit error modeling, leading to the neglect of such defects and overestimation of question quality. To address this issue, we propose ErrEval, a flexible and Error-aware Evaluation framework that enhances QG evaluation through explicit error diagnostics. Specifically, ErrEval reformulates evaluation as a two-stage process of error diagnosis followed by informed scoring. At the first stage, a lightweight plug-and-play Error Identifier detects and categorizes common errors across structural, linguistic, and content-related aspects. These diagnostic signals are then incorporated as explicit evidence to guide LLM evaluators toward more fine-grained and grounded judgments. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of ErrEval, showing that incorporating explicit diagnostics improves alignment with human judgments. Further analyses confirm that ErrEval effectively mitigates the overestimation of low-quality questions.

TL;DR: This paper introduces LADFA, a framework leveraging LLMs, RAG, and a custom knowledge base to automate the analysis of privacy policies, demonstrating its use in creating personal data flow graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy policies are often hard to understand due to their complexity and inconsistencies, making it challenging for users to comprehend personal data practices. The motivation is to create an automated solution that aids large-scale analysis and facilitates understanding of privacy policies.

Method: The authors employ LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and a customized knowledge base. They developed the LADFA framework with a pre-processor, an LLM-based processor, and a post-processor to process privacy policy texts, extract data flows, and visualize them as graphs.

Result: The framework was applied to ten privacy policies from the automotive sector, and results validated its effectiveness and accuracy in extracting and analyzing personal data flows.

Conclusion: LADFA is an effective and flexible solution for analyzing privacy policies. Its modular design ensures adaptability for broader text-based analytical tasks.

Abstract: Privacy policies help inform people about organisations' personal data processing practices, covering different aspects such as data collection, data storage, and sharing of personal data with third parties. Privacy policies are often difficult for people to fully comprehend due to the lengthy and complex legal language used and inconsistent practices across different sectors and organisations. To help conduct automated and large-scale analyses of privacy policies, many researchers have studied applications of machine learning and natural language processing techniques, including large language models (LLMs). While a limited number of prior studies utilised LLMs for extracting personal data flows from privacy policies, our approach builds on this line of work by combining LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and a customised knowledge base derived from existing studies. This paper presents the development of LADFA, an end-to-end computational framework, which can process unstructured text in a given privacy policy, extract personal data flows and construct a personal data flow graph, and conduct analysis of the data flow graph to facilitate insight discovery. The framework consists of a pre-processor, an LLM-based processor, and a data flow post-processor. We demonstrated and validated the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach by conducting a case study that involved examining ten selected privacy policies from the automotive industry. Moreover, it is worth noting that LADFA is designed to be flexible and customisable, making it suitable for a range of text-based analysis tasks beyond privacy policy analysis.

*Tiesunlong Shen,Rui Mao,Jin Wang,Heming Sun,Jian Zhang,Xuejie Zhang,Erik Cambria*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'LLMdoctor,' a framework for aligning large language models (LLMs) more efficiently at test-time using a patient-doctor paradigm, focusing on token-level optimization instead of traditional trajectory-level alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The existing methods for aligning LLMs with human preferences are either computationally expensive, inflexible, or suffer from limited performance and loss of generative diversity.

Method: A 'patient-doctor' framework is proposed where a frozen patient LLM is steered by a smaller, specialized doctor model. Token-level reward signals are extracted from the patient model, and flow-guided preference optimization (TFPO) enables precise alignment while retaining generation diversity.

Result: Experiments show that LLMdoctor outperforms current test-time alignment methods and surpasses full fine-tuning methods like DPO in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.

Conclusion: LLMdoctor is an efficient, scalable, and effective alternative for aligning large language models, achieving precise alignment without compromising generative diversity.

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences is critical, yet traditional fine-tuning methods are computationally expensive and inflexible. While test-time alignment offers a promising alternative, existing approaches often rely on distorted trajectory-level signals or inefficient sampling, fundamentally capping performance and failing to preserve the generative diversity of the base model. This paper introduces LLMdoctor, a novel framework for efficient test-time alignment that operates via a patient-doctor paradigm. It integrates token-level reward acquisition with token-level flow-guided preference optimization (TFPO) to steer a large, frozen patient LLM with a smaller, specialized doctor model. Unlike conventional methods that rely on trajectory-level rewards, LLMdoctor first extracts fine-grained, token-level preference signals from the patient model's behavioral variations. These signals then guide the training of the doctor model via TFPO, which establishes flow consistency across all subtrajectories, enabling precise token-by-token alignment while inherently preserving generation diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLMdoctor significantly outperforms existing test-time alignment methods and even surpasses the performance of full fine-tuning approaches like DPO.

TL;DR: NSR-Boost is a neuro-symbolic framework for upgrading legacy GBDT models safely and efficiently in industrial environments, addressing failure regions through residual boosting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Legacy GBDT models in high-concurrency environments face challenges in retraining due to cost and risks. This paper aims to offer a safe and low-cost solution for upgrading these models.

Method: NSR-Boost uses a three-stage process: identifying hard regions through residuals, generating interpretable experts using LLM and Bayesian optimization, and integrating outputs dynamically through a lightweight aggregator.

Result: NSR-Boost outperformed state-of-the-art models on six public datasets and one private dataset, delivering superior performance gains on real-world online data in financial risk control.

Conclusion: The framework effectively tackles missed long-tail risks in traditional models and provides scalable, efficient solutions for industrial model evolution.

Abstract: Although the Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs) dominate industrial tabular applications, upgrading legacy models in high-concurrency production environments still faces prohibitive retraining costs and systemic risks. To address this problem, we present NSR-Boost, a neuro-symbolic residual boosting framework designed specifically for industrial scenarios. Its core advantage lies in being "non-intrusive". It treats the legacy model as a frozen model and performs targeted repairs on "hard regions" where predictions fail. The framework comprises three key stages: first, finding hard regions through residuals, then generating interpretable experts by generating symbolic code structures using Large Language Model (LLM) and fine-tuning parameters using Bayesian optimization, and finally dynamically integrating experts with legacy model output through a lightweight aggregator. We report on the successful deployment of NSR-Boost within the core financial risk control system at Qfin Holdings. This framework not only significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines across six public datasets and one private dataset, more importantly, shows excellent performance gains on real-world online data. In conclusion, it effectively captures long-tail risks missed by traditional models and offers a safe, low-cost evolutionary paradigm for industry.

Motivation: Existing chart understanding datasets are limited to a small set of chart types and fail to comprehensively evaluate multimodal large language models.

Method: The authors created the ChartComplete dataset based on visualization community chart taxonomy, offering classified chart images of 30 chart types without embedding a learning signal.

Result: ChartComplete expands the range of chart types available for assessing chart understanding capabilities of MLLMs.

Abstract: With advancements in deep learning (DL) and computer vision techniques, the field of chart understanding is evolving rapidly. In particular, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are proving to be efficient and accurate in understanding charts. To accurately measure the performance of MLLMs, the research community has developed multiple datasets to serve as benchmarks. By examining these datasets, we found that they are all limited to a small set of chart types. To bridge this gap, we propose the ChartComplete dataset. The dataset is based on a chart taxonomy borrowed from the visualization community, and it covers thirty different chart types. The dataset is a collection of classified chart images and does not include a learning signal. We present the ChartComplete dataset as is to the community to build upon it.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DKGs often lack sufficient coverage compared to GKGs, necessitating a framework to integrate relevant information across the two while addressing challenges like ambiguity and differing levels of detail.

Method: The authors propose ExeFuse, which treats GKG facts as latent programs, uses granularity-aware operators, and ensures domain relevance by verifying executability within DKG in a unified probabilistic framework.

Result: The study constructs two benchmarks and demonstrates the effectiveness of ExeFuse through comprehensive experiments, proving the significance of DKGF and providing a standard testbed.

Conclusion: ExeFuse successfully tackles the issues of domain relevance and granularity misalignment, establishing the importance of DKGF as a task and offering a tangible solution for enriching domain-specific knowledge graphs.

Abstract: Domain-specific knowledge graphs (DKGs) often lack coverage compared to general knowledge graphs (GKGs). To address this, we introduce Domain-specific Knowledge Graph Fusion (DKGF), a novel task that enriches DKGs by integrating relevant facts from GKGs. DKGF faces two key challenges: high ambiguity in domain relevance and misalignment in knowledge granularity across graphs. We propose ExeFuse, a simple yet effective Fact-as-Program paradigm. It treats each GKG fact as a latent semantic program, maps abstract relations to granularity-aware operators, and verifies domain relevance via program executability on the target DKG. This unified probabilistic framework jointly resolves relevance and granularity issues. We construct two benchmarks, DKGF(W-I) and DKGF(Y-I), with 21 evaluation configurations. Extensive experiments validate the task's importance and our model's effectiveness, providing the first standardized testbed for DKGF.

TL;DR: The paper proposes GRACE, a framework for ensuring AI decisions are normatively aligned. GRACE uses neuro-symbolic methods to validate ethical decision-making, demonstrated on a therapy assistant.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensure AI systems act ethically and align with human norms, especially as they become increasingly autonomous and impactful.

Method: They introduce GRACE, a neuro-symbolic architecture with three components: a Moral Module for reasoning actions, a Decision-Making Module for optimizing agent actions, and a Guard ensuring moral compliance.

Result: GRACE successfully applied to a large language model (LLM) therapy assistant, allowing transparency and refinements in its decision-making.

Conclusion: GRACE offers a robust approach to enforce ethical alignment, interpretability, and adaptability in autonomous AI systems.

Abstract: As AI agents become increasingly autonomous, widely deployed in consequential contexts, and efficacious in bringing about real-world impacts, ensuring that their decisions are not only instrumentally effective but also normatively aligned has become critical. We introduce a neuro-symbolic reason-based containment architecture, Governor for Reason-Aligned ContainmEnt (GRACE), that decouples normative reasoning from instrumental decision-making and can contain AI agents of virtually any design. GRACE restructures decision-making into three modules: a Moral Module (MM) that determines permissible macro actions via deontic logic-based reasoning; a Decision-Making Module (DMM) that encapsulates the target agent while selecting instrumentally optimal primitive actions in accordance with derived macro actions; and a Guard that monitors and enforces moral compliance. The MM uses a reason-based formalism providing a semantic foundation for deontic logic, enabling interpretability, contestability, and justifiability. Its symbolic representation enriches the DMM's informational context and supports formal verification and statistical guarantees of alignment enforced by the Guard. We demonstrate GRACE on an example of a LLM therapy assistant, showing how it enables stakeholders to understand, contest, and refine agent behavior.

### [45] [Diagnosing Generalization Failures in Fine-Tuned LLMs: A Cross-Architectural Study on Phishing Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10524)
*Frank Bobe,Gregory D. Vetaw,Chase Pavlick,Darshan Bryner,Matthew Cook,Jose Salas-Vernis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates the generalization failures of fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) in specialized tasks, using a diagnostic framework across different model architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To diagnose why fine-tuned LLMs become brittle and fail to generalize effectively, particularly in high-stakes applications.

Method: The authors fine-tuned Llama 3.1 8B, Gemma 2 9B, and Mistral models on a phishing detection task, using SHAP analysis and mechanistic interpretability to study generalization failures.

Result: They found that generalization depends on architecture and data diversity, with Gemma 2 9B achieving >91% F1 only with diverse data, Llama 3.1 8B struggling with varied data, and Mistral proving robust across paradigms.

Conclusion: Reliable AI development requires validating the relationship between architecture, data, and training strategies to understand and address generalization failures.

Abstract: The practice of fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) has achieved state-of-the-art performance on specialized tasks, yet diagnosing why these models become brittle and fail to generalize remains a critical open problem. To address this, we introduce and apply a multi-layered diagnostic framework to a cross-architectural study. We fine-tune Llama 3.1 8B, Gemma 2 9B, and Mistral models on a high-stakes phishing detection task and use SHAP analysis and mechanistic interpretability to uncover the root causes of their generalization failures. Our investigation reveals three critical findings: (1) Generalization is driven by a powerful synergy between architecture and data diversity. The Gemma 2 9B model achieves state-of-the-art performance (>91\% F1), but only when trained on a stylistically diverse ``generalist'' dataset. (2) Generalization is highly architecture-dependent. We diagnose a specific failure mode in Llama 3.1 8B, which performs well on a narrow domain but cannot integrate diverse data, leading to a significant performance drop. (3) Some architectures are inherently more generalizable. The Mistral model proves to be a consistent and resilient performer across multiple training paradigms. By pinpointing the flawed heuristics responsible for these failures, our work provides a concrete methodology for diagnosing and understanding generalization failures, underscoring that reliable AI requires deep validation of the interplay between architecture, data, and training strategy.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the safety of seven multimodal models across various settings, revealing a heterogeneous safety landscape and vulnerabilities under adversarial conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address unclear improvements in safety among advanced language and multimodal models due to inconsistent evaluation practices.

Method: The authors use a unified protocol that includes benchmark, adversarial, multilingual, and compliance evaluations to assess the models across language, vision-language, and image generation modalities.

Result: The analysis identified substantial safety vulnerabilities in adversarial settings, with models performing variably across evaluations. GPT-5.2 stood out with relatively balanced safety performance, but others exhibited significant trade-offs.

Conclusion: Safety in frontier models is multidimensional and impacted by evaluation methods, highlighting the necessity for standardized safety evaluations to mitigate risks in real-world applications.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has produced substantial gains in reasoning, perception, and generative capability across language and vision. However, whether these advances yield commensurate improvements in safety remains unclear, in part due to fragmented evaluation practices limited to single modalities or threat models. In this report, we present an integrated safety evaluation of 7 frontier models: GPT-5.2, Gemini 3 Pro, Qwen3-VL, Doubao 1.8, Grok 4.1 Fast, Nano Banana Pro, and Seedream 4.5. We evaluate each model across language, vision-language, and image generation settings using a unified protocol that integrates benchmark evaluation, adversarial evaluation, multilingual evaluation, and compliance evaluation. Aggregating our evaluations into safety leaderboards and model safety profiles across multiple evaluation modes reveals a sharply heterogeneous safety landscape. While GPT-5.2 demonstrates consistently strong and balanced safety performance across evaluations, other models exhibit pronounced trade-offs among benchmark safety, adversarial alignment, multilingual generalization, and regulatory compliance. Both language and vision-language modalities show significant vulnerability under adversarial evaluation, with all models degrading substantially despite strong results on standard benchmarks. Text-to-image models achieve relatively stronger alignment in regulated visual risk categories, yet remain brittle under adversarial or semantically ambiguous prompts. Overall, these results show that safety in frontier models is inherently multidimensional--shaped by modality, language, and evaluation scheme, underscoring the need for standardized safety evaluations to accurately assess real-world risk and guide responsible model development and deployment.

### [47] [Defending Large Language Models Against Jailbreak Attacks via In-Decoding Safety-Awareness Probing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10543)
*Yinzhi Zhao,Ming Wang,Shi Feng,Xiaocui Yang,Daling Wang,Yifei Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to detect unsafe content in real-time during the generation process of large language models (LLMs) by using latent safety signals, improving safety against jailbreak attacks while preserving response quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the vulnerability of large language models to jailbreak attacks, as existing safety alignment efforts and defense mechanisms often fail against sophisticated attacks or degrade the models' utility.

Method: The method involves analyzing the latent safety-related signals present in LLMs during decoding and explicitly using these signals for early detection of unsafe content.

Result: The proposed approach significantly enhances safety by detecting unsafe content during decoding, maintains low false-positive refusal rates on benign inputs, and preserves overall response quality.

Conclusion: Activating intrinsic safety awareness during the decoding process of LLMs is a promising and effective direction for defending against jailbreak attacks without compromising performance or utility.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across natural language tasks and are increasingly deployed in real-world applications. Despite extensive safety alignment efforts, recent studies show that such alignment is often shallow and remains vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Existing defense mechanisms, including decoding-based constraints and post-hoc content detectors, struggle against sophisticated jailbreaks, often intervening robust detection or excessively degrading model utility. In this work, we examine the decoding process of LLMs and make a key observation: even when successfully jailbroken, models internally exhibit latent safety-related signals during generation. However, these signals are overridden by the model's drive for fluent continuation, preventing timely self-correction or refusal. Building on this observation, we propose a simple yet effective approach that explicitly surfaces and leverages these latent safety signals for early detection of unsafe content during decoding. Experiments across diverse jailbreak attacks demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances safety, while maintaining low over-refusal rates on benign inputs and preserving response quality. Our results suggest that activating intrinsic safety-awareness during decoding offers a promising and complementary direction for defending against jailbreak attacks.

TL;DR: The paper emphasizes the importance of analyzing LLM-based agent collectives, proposing frameworks to study their behavior and societal implications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to understand the societal risks and benefits of LLM-based multi-agent systems.

Method: Proposes an interactionist paradigm to examine how prior knowledge and social context affect emergent phenomena in LLM-based systems.

Result: Identifies four key directions for theory, methods, and interdisciplinary insights in the development of LLM collectives.

Conclusion: Urges for systematic frameworks and cross-disciplinary dialogue for responsible development and deployment of LLM-based collectives.

Abstract: In this article, we argue that understanding the collective behavior of agents based on large language models (LLMs) is an essential area of inquiry, with important implications in terms of risks and benefits, impacting us as a society at many levels. We claim that the distinctive nature of LLMs--namely, their initialization with extensive pre-trained knowledge and implicit social priors, together with their capability of adaptation through in-context learning--motivates the need for an interactionist paradigm consisting of alternative theoretical foundations, methodologies, and analytical tools, in order to systematically examine how prior knowledge and embedded values interact with social context to shape emergent phenomena in multi-agent generative AI systems. We propose and discuss four directions that we consider crucial for the development and deployment of LLM-based collectives, focusing on theory, methods, and trans-disciplinary dialogue.

Abstract: Comprehending genomic information is essential for biomedical research, yet extracting data from complex distributed databases remains challenging. Large language models (LLMs) offer potential for genomic Question Answering (QA) but face limitations due to restricted access to domain-specific databases. GeneGPT is the current state-of-the-art system that enhances LLMs by utilizing specialized API calls, though it is constrained by rigid API dependencies and limited adaptability. We replicate GeneGPT and propose GenomAgent, a multi-agent framework that efficiently coordinates specialized agents for complex genomics queries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To efficiently handle scenarios where satisfying all properties is impossible in LTLf synthesis with multiple conflicting properties.

Method: A fully symbolic algorithm that uses Boolean goal variables and the monotonicity property to compactly represent goal combinations and compute maximal realizable sets within a fixed-point framework.

Result: The proposed method provides substantial performance improvements over enumeration methods, achieving up to 100x speedup.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the feasibility and efficiency of compactly representing realizable goals in LTLf synthesis, making it more scalable for complex problems.

Abstract: We study LTLf synthesis with multiple properties, where satisfying all properties may be impossible. Instead of enumerating subsets of properties, we compute in one fixed-point computation the relation between product-game states and the goal sets that are realizable from them, and we synthesize strategies achieving maximal realizable sets. We develop a fully symbolic algorithm that introduces Boolean goal variables and exploits monotonicity to represent exponentially many goal combinations compactly. Our approach substantially outperforms enumeration-based baselines, with speedups of up to two orders of magnitude.

TL;DR: The study provides insights into HRM's reasoning process, revealing surprising limitations and leveraging strategies to enhance its accuracy significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand HRM’s strengths and weaknesses by studying its reasoning mechanisms, to improve its performance on complex tasks.

Method: The research identifies issues in HRM's reasoning through analysis, proposes strategies like data augmentation, input perturbation, and model bootstrapping, and integrates these to enhance reasoning accuracy.

Result: Augmented HRM improves Sudoku-Extreme accuracy from 54.5% to 96.9%, showcasing the efficacy of proposed methods.

Conclusion: The findings reveal limitations in HRM's reasoning and provide strategies to enhance its accuracy, offering critical insights into reasoning model behaviors.

Abstract: Hierarchical reasoning model (HRM) achieves extraordinary performance on various reasoning tasks, significantly outperforming large language model-based reasoners. To understand the strengths and potential failure modes of HRM, we conduct a mechanistic study on its reasoning patterns and find three surprising facts: (a) Failure of extremely simple puzzles, e.g., HRM can fail on a puzzle with only one unknown cell. We attribute this failure to the violation of the fixed point property, a fundamental assumption of HRM. (b) "Grokking" dynamics in reasoning steps, i.e., the answer is not improved uniformly, but instead there is a critical reasoning step that suddenly makes the answer correct; (c) Existence of multiple fixed points. HRM "guesses" the first fixed point, which could be incorrect, and gets trapped there for a while or forever. All facts imply that HRM appears to be "guessing" instead of "reasoning". Leveraging this "guessing" picture, we propose three strategies to scale HRM's guesses: data augmentation (scaling the quality of guesses), input perturbation (scaling the number of guesses by leveraging inference randomness), and model bootstrapping (scaling the number of guesses by leveraging training randomness). On the practical side, by combining all methods, we develop Augmented HRM, boosting accuracy on Sudoku-Extreme from 54.5% to 96.9%. On the scientific side, our analysis provides new insights into how reasoning models "reason".

### [52] [Structure and Diversity Aware Context Bubble Construction for Enterprise Retrieval Augmented Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10681)
*Amir Khurshid,Abhishek Sehgal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for constructing concise context bubbles for LLMs using structural priors and diversity constraints, improving information coherence and citation faithfulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address issues in RAG approaches like fragmented information, redundant content, and insufficient query context.

Method: Utilizing structure-informed and diversity-constrained selection to build context bubbles starting from anchor spans, balancing relevance, coverage, and penalties.

Result: The method reduces redundant contexts, improves secondary facet coverage, enhances answer quality, and provides auditability in retrieval.

Conclusion: Structural priors and diversity constraints are essential for generating compact, coherent contexts, ensuring efficient results within a limited window.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) contexts are typically constructed using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which involves ranking and selecting the top-k passages. The approach causes fragmentation in information graphs in document structures, over-retrieval, and duplication of content alongside insufficient query context, including 2nd and 3rd order facets. In this paper, a structure-informed and diversity-constrained context bubble construction framework is proposed that assembles coherent, citable bundles of spans under a strict token budget. The method preserves and exploits inherent document structure by organising multi-granular spans (e.g., sections and rows) and using task-conditioned structural priors to guide retrieval. Starting from high-relevance anchor spans, a context bubble is constructed through constrained selection that balances query relevance, marginal coverage, and redundancy penalties. It will explicitly constrain diversity and budget, producing compact and informative context sets, unlike top-k retrieval. Moreover, a full retrieval is emitted that traces the scoring and selection choices of the records, thus providing auditability and deterministic tuning. Experiments on enterprise documents demonstrate the efficiency of context bubble as it significantly reduces redundant context, is better able to cover secondary facets and has a better answer quality and citation faithfulness within a limited context window. Ablation studies demonstrate that both structural priors as well as diversity constraint selection are necessary; removing either component results in a decline in coverage and an increase in redundant or incomplete context.

### [53] [The Impact of Generative AI on Architectural Conceptual Design: Performance, Creative Self-Efficacy and Cognitive Load](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10696)
*Han Jiang,Yao Xiao,Rachel Hurley,Shichao Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study investigates the impact of Generative AI (GenAI) on performance, creative self-efficacy, and cognitive load in architectural design tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how GenAI can influence design performance, creativity confidence, and mental effort in architectural conceptual design tasks, especially since there is limited knowledge on its efficacy in this domain.

Method: The research involved 36 students performing architectural design tasks with and without GenAI. Performance was graded by experts, while self-efficacy and cognitive load were self-reported. Comparative analyses and subgroup assessments were conducted to examine differences.

Result: GenAI showed no overall performance benefit but improved results for novice designers. Creative self-efficacy declined with GenAI use, and cognitive load was not significantly impacted. Effective prompts reduced cognitive load.

Conclusion: GenAI effectiveness varies based on users' prior expertise. Strategic prompts can mitigate mental effort, but reliance on GenAI may lower creative confidence.

Abstract: Our study examines how generative AI (GenAI) influences performance, creative self-efficacy, and cognitive load in architectural conceptual design tasks. Thirty-six student participants from Architectural Engineering and other disciplines completed a two-phase architectural design task, first independently and then with external tools (GenAI-assisted condition and control condition using an online repository of existing architectural projects). Design outcomes were evaluated by expert raters, while self-efficacy and cognitive load were self-reported after each phase. Difference-in-differences analyses revealed no overall performance advantage of GenAI across participants; however, subgroup analyses showed that GenAI significantly improved design performance for novice designers. In contrast, general creative self-efficacy declined for students using GenAI. Cognitive load did not differ significantly between conditions, though prompt usage patterns showed that iterative idea generation and visual feedback prompts were linked to greater reductions in cognitive load. These findings suggest that GenAI effectiveness depends on users' prior expertise and interaction strategies through prompting.

*Binglei Lou,Ruilin Wu,Philip Leong*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: SparseLUT enhances DNN deployment on edge devices by reducing LUT size and improving efficiency while maintaining accuracy through architectural and training optimizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks on edge devices demand a balance of latency, power, hardware usage, and accuracy. Current LUT-based DNNs face size growth and connectivity inefficiencies.

Method: SparseLUT introduces multi-PolyLUT sub-neuron aggregation to reduce LUT consumption, and employs a selective pruning-and-regrowth training algorithm for improved connectivity and accuracy.

Result: SparseLUT achieves significant reductions in LUT usage (2.0x-13.9x smaller), lower inference latency (1.2x-1.6x faster), and boosts in accuracy (up to 2.13% on MNIST, 0.94% on Jet Substructure Classification).

Conclusion: SparseLUT offers a resource-efficient solution for LUT-based DNNs, balancing hardware constraints and accuracy through innovative design and training optimizations.

Abstract: Deploying deep neural networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained edge devices such as FPGAs requires a careful balance among latency, power, and hardware resource usage, while maintaining high accuracy. Existing Lookup Table (LUT)-based DNNs -- such as LogicNets, PolyLUT, and NeuraLUT -- face two critical challenges: the exponential growth of LUT size and inefficient random sparse connectivity. This paper presents SparseLUT, a comprehensive framework that addresses these challenges through two orthogonal optimizations. First, we propose an architectural enhancement that aggregates multiple PolyLUT sub-neurons via an adder, significantly reducing LUT consumption by 2.0x-13.9x and lowering inference latency by 1.2x-1.6x, all while maintaining comparable accuracy. Building upon this foundation, we further introduce a non-greedy training algorithm that optimizes neuron connectivity by selectively pruning less significant inputs and strategically regrowing more effective ones. This training optimization, which incurs no additional area and latency overhead, delivers consistent accuracy improvements across benchmarks -- achieving up to a 2.13% gain on MNIST and 0.94% on Jet Substructure Classification compared to existing LUT-DNN approaches.

TL;DR: The paper focuses on optimizing next-generation XR platforms by categorizing XR workloads and providing design guidelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for improved ultra-low-latency performance under power and area constraints for heterogeneous XR workloads.

Method: Using model-based design space exploration and empirical profiling to classify XR workloads into architectural archetypes.

Result: 12 XR kernels are analyzed, leading to workload archetypes and pinpointed architectural characteristics.

Conclusion: Future XR designs should shift toward phase-aware scheduling and elastic resource allocation for better efficiency.

Abstract: Edge and mobile platforms for augmented and virtual reality, collectively referred to as extended reality (XR) must deliver deterministic ultra-low-latency performance under stringent power and area constraints. However, the diversity of XR workloads is rapidly increasing, characterized by heterogeneous operator types and complex dataflow structures. This trend poses significant challenges to conventional accelerator architectures centered around convolutional neural networks (CNNs), resulting in diminishing returns for traditional compute-centric optimization strategies. Despite the importance of this problem, a systematic architectural understanding of the full XR pipeline remains lacking. In this paper, we present an architectural classification of XR workloads using a cross-layer methodology that integrates model-based high-level design space exploration (DSE) with empirical profiling on commercial GPU and CPU hardware. By analyzing a representative set of workloads spanning 12 distinct XR kernels, we distill their complex architectural characteristics into a small set of cross-layer workload archetypes (e.g., capacity-limited and overhead-sensitive). Building on these archetypes, we further extract key architectural insights and provide actionable design guidelines for next-generation XR SoCs. Our study highlights that XR architecture design must shift from generic resource scaling toward phase-aware scheduling and elastic resource allocation in order to achieve greater energy efficiency and high performance in future XR systems.

TL;DR: The paper proposes ProUtt, a method centered on intent reasoning for predicting users' next utterances in dialogues. This approach uses an intent tree to advance predictive accuracy and improve user experience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is derived from limitations of current solutions, which face privacy concerns, high computational costs, and lack explicit modeling of intent reasoning processes for next utterance prediction.

Method: ProUtt is an LLM-based preference data synthesis approach that builds intent trees to map dialogue progression and models user intent reasoning for predicting the next plausible utterance.

Result: ProUtt achieves superior prediction outcomes compared to existing methods, validated by human and LLM evaluations across four benchmarks.

Conclusion: ProUtt addresses critical gaps in intent reasoning for next utterance prediction and offers an effective alternative to costly or privacy-challenging solutions with open-source contributions for research advancement.

Abstract: Proactively predicting a users next utterance in human-machine dialogue can streamline interaction and improve user experience. Existing commercial API-based solutions are subject to privacy concerns while deploying general-purpose LLMs locally remains computationally expensive. As such, training a compact, task-specific LLM provides a practical alternative. Although user simulator methods can predict a user's next utterance, they mainly imitate their speaking style rather than advancing the dialogue. Preference data synthesis has been investigated to generate data for proactive next utterance prediction and help align LLMs with user preferences. Yet existing methods lack the ability to explicitly model the intent reasoning that leads to the user's next utterance and to define and synthesize preference and non-preference reasoning processes for predicting the user's next utterance.To address these challenges, we propose ProUtt, an LLM-driven preference data synthesis method for proactive next utterance prediction. ProUtt converts dialogue history into an intent tree and explicitly models intent reasoning trajectories by predicting the next plausible path from both exploitation and exploration perspectives. It then constructs preference and non-preference reasoning processes by perturbing or revising intent tree paths at different future turns. Extensive evaluations using LLM-as-a-judge and human judgments demonstrate that ProUtt consistently outperforms existing data synthesis methods, user simulators, and commercial LLM APIs across four benchmark datasets. We release both the code and the synthesized datasets to facilitate future research.

Motivation: The authors aim to address concerns about AI research outputs copying or rephrasing existing ideas ('smart plagiarism') and explore how multi-step workflows might enhance genuine creativity and originality in AI-driven research ideation.

Method: The study benchmarks five reasoning architectures, including decomposition-based and reflection-based workflows, through the analysis of 30 generated research proposals. These are evaluated on novelty, feasibility, and impact.

Result: Decomposition-based and long-context workflows emerged as the most effective, scoring high on novelty (4.17/5), while reflection-based approaches scored lower (2.33/5). High-performing workflows balanced creativity with feasibility across research domains.

Conclusion: The findings indicate that carefully designed multi-step workflows significantly enhance AI-driven research ideation, boosting novelty and feasibility without compromising creativity.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into the scientific ecosystem raises fundamental questions about the creativity and originality of AI-generated research. Recent work has identified ``smart plagiarism'' as a concern in single-step prompting approaches, where models reproduce existing ideas with terminological shifts. This paper investigates whether agentic workflows -- multi-step systems employing iterative reasoning, evolutionary search, and recursive decomposition -- can generate more novel and feasible research plans. We benchmark five reasoning architectures: Reflection-based iterative refinement, Sakana AI v2 evolutionary algorithms, Google Co-Scientist multi-agent framework, GPT Deep Research (GPT-5.1) recursive decomposition, and Gemini~3 Pro multimodal long-context pipeline. Using evaluations from thirty proposals each on novelty, feasibility, and impact, we find that decomposition-based and long-context workflows achieve mean novelty of 4.17/5, while reflection-based approaches score significantly lower (2.33/5). Results reveal varied performance across research domains, with high-performing workflows maintaining feasibility without sacrificing creativity. These findings support the view that carefully designed multi-stage agentic workflows can advance AI-assisted research ideation.

Conclusion: Emphasizes ethical data governance, open resources, and interdisciplinary collaboration for long-term NLP development in Senegalese languages.

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) is rapidly transforming research methodologies across disciplines, yet African languages remain largely underrepresented in this technological shift. This paper provides the first comprehensive overview of NLP progress and challenges for the six national languages officially recognized by the Senegalese Constitution: Wolof, Pulaar, Sereer, Joola, Mandingue, and Soninke.

Building on existing initiatives and research works, we analyze ongoing efforts in text normalization, machine translation, and speech processing. We also provide a centralized GitHub repository that compiles publicly accessible resources for a range of NLP tasks across these languages, designed to facilitate collaboration and reproducibility. A special focus is devoted to the application of NLP to the social sciences, where multilingual transcription, translation, and retrieval pipelines can significantly enhance the efficiency and inclusiveness of field research. The paper concludes by outlining a roadmap toward sustainable, community-centered NLP ecosystems for Senegalese languages, emphasizing ethical data governance, open resources, and interdisciplinary collaboration.

Method: The study developed a backend-agnostic extraction pipeline (SALP-CG) using few-shot guidance, JSON Schema constrained decoding, and deterministic high-risk rules to classify and grade sensitivity in health data. The pipeline complies with GB/T 39725-2020 standards.

Result: SALP-CG achieves robust results, including micro-F1=0.900 for top-level predictions, on the MedDialog-CN benchmark. It reliably identifies and grades sensitive conversational health data into categories based on potential privacy risks.

Conclusion: SALP-CG provides a reliable and practical framework for health-data classification and sensitivity grading, assisting in governance and standardizing practices for privacy in online medical conversations.

Abstract: Online medical consultations generate large volumes of conversational health data that often embed protected health information, requiring robust methods to classify data categories and assign risk levels in line with policies and practice. However, existing approaches lack unified standards and reliable automated methods to fulfill sensitivity classification for such conversational health data. This study presents a large language model-based extraction pipeline, SALP-CG, for classifying and grading privacy risks in online conversational health data. We concluded health-data classification and grading rules in accordance with GB/T 39725-2020. Combining few-shot guidance, JSON Schema constrained decoding, and deterministic high-risk rules, the backend-agnostic extraction pipeline achieves strong category compliance and reliable sensitivity across diverse LLMs. On the MedDialog-CN benchmark, models yields robust entity counts, high schema compliance, and accurate sensitivity grading, while the strongest model attains micro-F1=0.900 for maximum-level prediction. The category landscape stratified by sensitivity shows that Level 2-3 items dominate, enabling re-identification when combined; Level 4-5 items are less frequent but carry outsize harm. SALP-CG reliably helps classify categories and grading sensitivity in online conversational health data across LLMs, offering a practical method for health data governance.

*Jing-Yi Zeng,Guan-Hua Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores building a domain-specific LLM specialized in statistics using LLaMA-3.2-3B models, assessing multiple training pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient methodology for creating domain-specialized LLMs capable of statistical reasoning.

Method: Compared three training pipelines using continual pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, RLHF alignment, and downstream task adaptation based on varying initial models.

Result: Starting with an instruction-tuned model yields effective domain specialization. Trade-offs between domain expertise and general reasoning were identified, with RLHF optimizing preferences successfully.

Conclusion: StatLLaMA achieves balanced performance across various tasks, providing guidelines for resource-efficient statistical LMM development.

Abstract: This study investigates how to efficiently build a domain-specialized large language model (LLM) for statistics using the lightweight LLaMA-3.2-3B family as the foundation model (FM). We systematically compare three multi-stage training pipelines, starting from a base FM with no instruction-following capability, a base FM augmented with post-hoc instruction tuning, and an instruction-tuned FM with strong general reasoning abilities across continual pretraining, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) preference alignment, and downstream task adaptation. Results show that pipelines beginning with a base FM fail to develop meaningful statistical reasoning, even after extensive instruction tuning, SFT, or RLHF alignment. In contrast, starting from LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct enables effective domain specialization. A comprehensive evaluation of SFT variants reveals clear trade-offs between domain expertise and general reasoning ability. We further demonstrate that direct preference optimization provides stable and effective RLHF preference alignment. Finally, we show that downstream fine-tuning must be performed with extremely low intensity to avoid catastrophic forgetting in highly optimized models. The final model, StatLLaMA, achieves strong and balanced performance on benchmarks of mathematical reasoning, common-sense reasoning, and statistical expertise, offering a practical blueprint for developing resource-efficient statistical LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/HuangDLab/StatLLaMA.

### [62] [Bounded Hyperbolic Tangent: A Stable and Efficient Alternative to Pre-Layer Normalization in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09719)
*Hoyoon Byun,Youngjun Choi,Taero Kim,Sungrae Park,Kyungwoo Song*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Bounded Hyperbolic Tanh (BHyT), a method replacing Pre-Layer Normalization, offering faster, more stable training while maintaining high performance in large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inefficiency and instability of Pre-Layer Normalization (Pre-LN) in large language models arise from repeated statistical calculations and increasing variance at deep layers. Alternative methods lack stability at greater depths.

Method: The method, BHyT, integrates tanh nonlinearity with data-driven input bounding to control activation magnitude and variance. It uses exact block-only statistics and lightweight variance approximations for efficiency.

Result: BHyT showed 15.8% training acceleration and a 4.2% increase in token generation throughput over RMSNorm, with improved robustness and matching or better inference performance across NLP benchmarks.

Conclusion: BHyT effectively improves both training efficiency and stability in large language models, addressing key limitations of Pre-LN and Dynamic Tanh methods.

Abstract: Pre-Layer Normalization (Pre-LN) is the de facto choice for large language models (LLMs) and is crucial for stable pretraining and effective transfer learning. However, Pre-LN is inefficient due to repeated statistical calculations and suffers from the curse of depth. As layers grow, the magnitude and variance of the hidden state escalate, destabilizing training. Efficiency-oriented normalization-free methods such as Dynamic Tanh (DyT) improve speed but remain fragile at depth. To jointly address stability and efficiency, we propose Bounded Hyperbolic Tanh (BHyT), a drop-in replacement for Pre-LN. BHyT couples a tanh nonlinearity with explicit, data-driven input bounding to keep activations within a non-saturating range. It prevents depth-wise growth in activation magnitude and variance and comes with a theoretical stability guarantee. For efficiency, BHyT computes exact statistics once per block and replaces a second normalization with a lightweight variance approximation, enhancing efficiency. Empirically, BHyT demonstrates improved stability and efficiency during pretraining, achieving an average of 15.8% faster training and an average of 4.2% higher token generation throughput compared to RMSNorm., while matching or surpassing its inference performance and robustness across language understanding and reasoning benchmarks.

### [63] [Uncertainty-Aware Dynamic Knowledge Graphs for Reliable Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09720)
*Yu Takahashi,Shun Takeuchi,Kexuan Xin,Guillaume Pelat,Yoshiaki Ikai,Junya Saito,Jonathan Vitale,Shlomo Berkovsky,Amin Beheshti*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a QA system leveraging dynamic and uncertainty-aware knowledge graphs (KGs) to improve reliability in complex, evolving, and uncertain domains like healthcare.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing QA systems often rely on static and deterministic knowledge graphs, which fail to adapt to evolving information or account for uncertainty in reasoning, limiting reliability and interpretability.

Method: The framework involves (i) dynamically constructing evolving knowledge graphs, (ii) implementing confidence scoring and uncertainty-aware retrieval, and (iii) providing an interactive interface for interpretable QA.

Result: The system demonstrates the practicality of uncertainty-aware dynamic KGs by constructing evolving healthcare KGs from patient records, visualizing uncertainty, and improving outcomes in a mortality prediction task.

Conclusion: Uncertainty-aware dynamic KGs can significantly enhance the robustness, transparency, and reliability of QA systems, particularly in high-stakes fields like healthcare.

Abstract: Question answering (QA) systems are increasingly deployed across domains. However, their reliability is undermined when retrieved evidence is incomplete, noisy, or uncertain. Existing knowledge graph (KG) based QA frameworks typically represent facts as static and deterministic, failing to capture the evolving nature of information and the uncertainty inherent in reasoning. We present a demonstration of uncertainty-aware dynamic KGs, a framework that combines (i) dynamic construction of evolving KGs, (ii) confidence scoring and uncertainty-aware retrieval, and (iii) an interactive interface for reliable and interpretable QA. Our system highlights how uncertainty modeling can make QA more robust and transparent by enabling users to explore dynamic graphs, inspect confidence-annotated triples, and compare baseline versus confidence-aware answers. The target users of this demo are clinical data scientists and clinicians, and we instantiate the framework in healthcare: constructing personalized KGs from electronic health records, visualizing uncertainty across patient visits, and evaluating its impact on a mortality prediction task. This use case demonstrates the broader promise of uncertainty-aware dynamic KGs for enhancing QA reliability in high-stakes applications.

### [64] [Cross-Platform Evaluation of Large Language Model Safety in Pediatric Consultations: Evolution of Adversarial Robustness and the Scale Paradox](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09721)
*Vahideh Zolfaghari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines the safety of large language models (LLMs) in pediatric medical consultations under parental anxiety-driven adversarial conditions and highlights areas of improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the safety and reliability of LLMs under realistic stress scenarios, particularly in medical consultations involving potentially anxious users.

Method: The researchers used PediatricAnxietyBench with 300 queries (150 standard, 150 adversarial) across three models (Llama-3.3-70B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Mistral-7B). Safety was measured through a 0-15 scale assessing multiple factors such as restraint and emergency recognition.

Result: Smaller LLMs like Llama-3.1-8B and Mistral-7B outperformed larger ones (Llama-3.3-70B) in safety. The Mistral-7B model demonstrated the strongest adversarial improvement, and hedging correlated positively with safety. However, errors were present in emergency recognition (e.g., seizures).

Conclusion: Model safety relies on design and alignment more than size. While smaller LLMs perform better, all models exhibit vulnerabilities and lack emergency handling capabilities, indicating current unsuitability for real-time medical triage.

Abstract: Background Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in medical consultations, yet their safety under realistic user pressures remains understudied. Prior assessments focused on neutral conditions, overlooking vulnerabilities from anxious users challenging safeguards. This study evaluated LLM safety under parental anxiety-driven adversarial pressures in pediatric consultations across models and platforms. Methods PediatricAnxietyBench, from a prior evaluation, includes 300 queries (150 authentic, 150 adversarial) spanning 10 topics. Three models were assessed via APIs: Llama-3.3-70B and Llama-3.1-8B (Groq), Mistral-7B (HuggingFace), yielding 900 responses. Safety used a 0-15 scale for restraint, referral, hedging, emergency recognition, and non-prescriptive behavior. Analyses employed paired t-tests with bootstrapped CIs. Results Mean scores: 9.70 (Llama-3.3-70B) to 10.39 (Mistral-7B). Llama-3.1-8B outperformed Llama-3.3-70B by +0.66 (p=0.0001, d=0.225). Models showed positive adversarial effects, Mistral-7B strongest (+1.09, p=0.0002). Safety generalized across platforms; Llama-3.3-70B had 8% failures. Seizures vulnerable (33% inappropriate diagnoses). Hedging predicted safety (r=0.68, p<0.001). Conclusions Evaluation shows safety depends on alignment and architecture over scale, with smaller models outperforming larger. Evolution to robustness across releases suggests targeted training progress. Vulnerabilities and no emergency recognition indicate unsuitability for triage. Findings guide selection, stress adversarial testing, and provide open benchmark for medical AI safety.

*Franciszek Górski,Andrzej Czyżewski*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study developed effective classifiers for tagging medical texts in Polish, using a multilingual LLM for annotation and verified with limited resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of annotated resources for medical texts in Polish necessitated efficient solutions to train high-performing classifiers.

Method: A multilingual LLM (Llama3.1) annotated a medical text corpus, verified partially, and used to train and validate BERT-based classifiers.

Result: DistilBERT achieved the highest performance with F1 scores > 0.80 for all clinical categories and > 0.93 for 3 categories.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate effective alternatives to large language models, offering significant advantages in size, VRAM usage, and inference speed.

Abstract: In this work, we present an annotation framework that demonstrates how a multilingual LLM pretrained on a large corpus can be used as a teacher model to distill the expert knowledge needed for tagging medical texts in Polish. This work is part of a larger project called ADMEDVOICE, within which we collected an extensive corpus of medical texts representing five clinical categories - Radiology, Oncology, Cardiology, Hypertension, and Pathology. Using this data, we had to develop a multi-class classifier, but the fundamental problem turned out to be the lack of resources for annotating an adequate number of texts. Therefore, in our solution, we used the multilingual Llama3.1 model to annotate an extensive corpus of medical texts in Polish. Using our limited annotation resources, we verified only a portion of these labels, creating a test set from them. The data annotated in this way were then used for training and validation of 3 different types of classifiers based on the BERT architecture - the distilled DistilBERT model, BioBERT fine-tuned on medical data, and HerBERT fine-tuned on the Polish language corpus. Among the models we trained, the DistilBERT model achieved the best results, reaching an F1 score > 0.80 for each clinical category and an F1 score > 0.93 for 3 of them. In this way, we obtained a series of highly effective classifiers that represent an alternative to large language models, due to their nearly 500 times smaller size, 300 times lower GPU VRAM consumption, and several hundred times faster inference.

*Guancheng Du,Yong Hu,Wenqing Wang,Yaming Yang,Jiaheng Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SagaScale introduces a novel long-context benchmark built from full-length novels to evaluate LLMs on understanding lengthy documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in long-context benchmarks such as task realism, data scalability, and quality of data, and to improve LLMs' performance with long and complex contexts.

Method: SagaScale leverages a fully automated data collection pipeline with external resources like Wikipedia to generate question-answer pairs, ensuring benchmarks are realistic and scalable. Evaluation is conducted across 12 LLMs and three long-context processing methods.

Result: Findings reveal that providing full context to LLMs is significantly effective. Many LLMs face challenges with lengthy contexts, though Gemini-2.5-Pro performs particularly well. Agentic RAG improves retrieval performance compared to Naïve RAG.

Conclusion: SagaScale offers a pioneering bilingual benchmark with unprecedented context lengths, supporting analysis of LLM performance and promoting research advancements by providing public access to both benchmark data and codebase.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant progress, but understanding long and complex documents remains challenging. Many long-context benchmarks have been proposed, but they face several limitations, including task realism, data scalability, and data quality. To this end, we introduce SagaScale, a realistic, scalable, and high-quality long-context benchmark built from full-length novels. The entire benchmark is constructed using an automated data collection pipeline that utilizes external resources (e.g., Wikipedia pages) to curate question-answer pairs. Critically, these external resources are provided only for benchmark construction and not during evaluation, which allows LLMs to curate complex questions that go beyond what they can answer during evaluation. SagaScale is also bilingual and offers the largest context length to date, with average token counts exceeding 250K for English novels and 320K for Chinese novels. Our evaluation across 12 frontier LLMs and three long-context methods -- Naïve RAG, Agentic RAG, and Long Context -- yields key insights, including: (1) Directly supplying the full context to the LLM can outperform other methods by a large margin; (2) Most LLMs still struggle with lengthy contexts, but Gemini-2.5-Pro stands out as an exception; and (3) Agentic RAG effectively addresses the retrieval bottleneck in Naïve RAG. Finally, we publicly release the SagaScale benchmark and our data collection codebase to facilitate future research.

### [67] [Syntactic Framing Fragility: An Audit of Robustness in LLM Ethical Decisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09724)
*Katherine Elkins,Jon Chun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines the fragility of large language models (LLMs) in maintaining consistent ethical judgments under syntactic variations and proposes a framework to evaluate this robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to ensure that LLMs deployed in consequential decision-making are robust and consistent in ethical judgments, even under benign syntactic variations, as these inconsistencies could have significant implications.

Method: The authors introduced the Syntactic Framing Fragility (SFF) evaluation framework using Logical Polarity Normalization (LPN) to isolate syntactic effects and compare various scenarios and framing variations. They conducted an audit across 23 LLMs over 39,975 decisions using ethical scenarios.

Result: They discovered significant inconsistencies in ethical decisions due to syntactic framing, with open-source models showing more fragility compared to commercial models. They noted higher fragility in financial contexts and identified chain-of-thought reasoning as a mitigation strategy.

Conclusion: Syntactic consistency is a critical dimension of ethical robustness for LLMs, and SFF audits should be a part of safety evaluations for these models. Additionally, mitigation strategies, such as chain-of-thought reasoning, can enhance robustness.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in consequential decision-making settings, yet their robustness to benign prompt variation remains underexplored. In this work, we study whether LLMs maintain consistent ethical judgments across logically equivalent but syntactically different prompts, focusing on variations involving negation and conditional structure. We introduce Syntactic Framing Fragility (SFF), a robustness evaluation framework that isolates purely syntactic effects via Logical Polarity Normalization (LPN), enabling direct comparison of decisions across positive and negative framings without semantic drift. Auditing 23 state-of-the-art models spanning the U.S. and China as well as small U.S. open-source software models over 14 ethical scenarios and four controlled framings (39,975 decisions), we find widespread and statistically significant inconsistency: many models reverse ethical endorsements solely due to syntactic polarity, with open-source models exhibiting over twice the fragility of commercial counterparts. We further uncover extreme negation sensitivity, where some models endorse actions in 80-97% of cases when explicitly prompted with "should not." We show that eliciting chain-of-thought reasoning substantially reduces fragility, identifying a practical mitigation lever, and we map fragility across scenarios, finding higher risk in financial and business contexts than in medical scenarios. Our results demonstrate that syntactic consistency constitutes a distinct and critical dimension of ethical robustness, and we argue that SFF-style audits should be a standard component of safety evaluation for deployed LLMs. Code and results will be available on github.com.

### [68] [Assessing and Improving Punctuation Robustness in English-Marathi Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09725)
*Kaustubh Shivshankar Shejole,Sourabh Deoghare,Pushpak Bhattacharyya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Punctuation robustness in Marathi machine translation is studied using a specific benchmark, Virām, showing improvements with fine-tuned and pipeline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of punctuation ambiguity in English-to-Marathi translation, especially in low-resource language settings.

Method: Create and utilize the Virām benchmark with punctuation-ambiguous examples for evaluation. Compare restore-then-translate pipelines and fine-tuned methods.

Result: Specialized models and pipelines enhanced translation quality over baselines, whereas LLMs struggled in preserving meaning under punctuation ambiguity.

Conclusion: Task-specific approaches outperformed general models, indicating the need for specialized strategies to handle punctuation ambiguity in translation tasks.

Abstract: Punctuation plays a critical role in resolving semantic and structural ambiguity in written language. Machine Translation (MT) systems are now widely applied across diverse domains and languages, including many low-resource settings. In this work, we focus on Marathi, a low- to middle-resource language. We introduce Virām, the first diagnostic benchmark for assessing punctuation robustness in English-to-Marathi machine translation, consisting of 54 manually curated, punctuation-ambiguous instances. We evaluate two primary strategies for enhancing reliability: a pipeline-based restore-then-translate approach and direct fine-tuned on punctuation-varied data. Our results demonstrate that specialized fine-tuned models and pipeline systems significantly improve translation quality over standard baselines on the Virām benchmark. Qualitative analysis reveals that the original model may result in wrong translations leading to wrong interpretations, while fine-tuned models significantly improve overall reliability. Furthermore, we find that current Large Language Models (LLMs) lag behind these task-specific approaches in preserving meaning for punctuation-ambiguous text, thus necessitating further research in this area.

*Hien Tran,Quinten Steenhuis,Alexandros Christoforos,Chadbourne Davis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study reinterprets forgetting in large language models (LLMs) as a functional mechanism, inspired by human memory dynamics. It introduces benchmarks and strategies improving reasoning by mimicking human memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and embrace the forgetting behavior of LLMs, recasting it as a potential strength rather than a limitation, analogous to human cognitive mechanisms.

Method: The authors modeled LLMs' memory dynamics through probabilistic memory processes with exponential decay. They developed benchmarks to evaluate aspects like temporal reasoning and associative recall, and proposed probabilistic memory prompting to improve reasoning.

Result: Findings show that LLMs' forgetting rates align with human-like trade-offs between memory stability and adaptability, enhancing their long-horizon reasoning with the proposed approach.

Conclusion: Forgetting in LLMs should be seen as an adaptive feature, not a flaw, enabling reasoning improvements by mimicking human-like memory decay through probabilistic mechanisms.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are often evaluated against ideals of perfect Bayesian inference, yet growing evidence suggests that their in-context reasoning exhibits systematic forgetting of past information. Rather than viewing this behavior as a limitation, we reinterpret forgetting as a functional cognitive mechanism. Drawing inspiration from human memory dynamics, we model LLM inference as a probabilistic memory process governed by exponential decay. We introduce a benchmark suite that evaluates temporal reasoning, concept drift adaptation, and associative recall, enabling direct comparison between model behavior and human cognitive patterns. Our empirical results reveal that LLMs demonstrate forgetting rates analogous to human memory efficiency trade-offs between stability and adaptability. Building on these observations, we propose probabilistic memory prompting, a lightweight strategy that shapes evidence integration to mimic human-like memory decay, leading to improved long-horizon reasoning performance. Our findings position forgetting not as a failure mode, but as a principled mechanism for adaptive intelligence.

### [70] [SciNets: Graph-Constrained Multi-Hop Reasoning for Scientific Literature Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09727)
*Sauhard Dubey*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces SciNets, a graph-based methodology for synthesizing mechanistic explanations across scientific literature, addressing limitations of traditional retrieval and language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for scientific synthesis struggle with connecting fragmented mechanistic explanations across different domains due to limited reasoning depth and lack of structural grounding.

Method: SciNets frames mechanistic synthesis as a graph-constrained multi-hop reasoning task, constructing directed concept graphs from literature and identifying reasoning paths that link rarely co-occurring concepts.

Result: The paper systematically compares different graph-based reasoning approaches and observes a trade-off between reasoning depth/diversity and stability, highlighting limits of current methods in achieving both.

Conclusion: Explicitly using graph constraints enables controllable and systematic reasoning in scientific synthesis, but deeper reasoning introduces instability, reflecting the current boundaries of graph and language model integration.

Abstract: Cross-domain scientific synthesis requires connecting mechanistic explanations across fragmented literature, a capability that remains challenging for both retrieval-based systems and unconstrained language models. While recent work has applied large language models to scientific summarization and question answering, these approaches provide limited control over reasoning depth and structural grounding. We frame mechanistic synthesis as a graph-constrained multi-hop reasoning problem over literature-derived concept graphs. Given a scientific query and a compact, query-local corpus, SciNets constructs a directed concept graph and synthesizes mechanistic explanations by identifying multi-hop reasoning paths that connect concepts that rarely co-occur within individual papers. We systematically compare shortest-path reasoning, k-shortest paths with diversity constraints, stochastic random walks, and a retrieval-augmented language model baseline. Rather than evaluating correctness, which is often indeterminate when synthesizing connections across distributed sources, we introduce a behavioral framework that measures symbolic reasoning depth, mechanistic diversity, and grounding stability. Across machine learning, biology, and climate science tasks, explicit graph constraints enable controllable multi-hop reasoning while revealing a consistent trade-off: deeper and more diverse symbolic reasoning increases grounding instability, whereas shortest-path reasoning remains highly stable but structurally conservative. These findings provide a systematic behavioral characterization of the limits and capabilities of current graph-LLM integration for scientific synthesis.

### [71] [Eliminating Agentic Workflow for Introduction Generation with Parametric Stage Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09728)
*Meicong Zhang,Tiancheng su,Guoxiu He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach, STIG, which embeds logical workflows directly into large language models (LLMs) to generate complete research introductions in a single inference, eliminating the need for external workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of writing research introductions such as maintaining rigorous logic, coherent structure, and avoiding error accumulation in existing predefined agentic workflows.

Method: The authors propose STIG, which converts the multi-stage workflows into explicit stage tokens. These tokens guide LLMs during text generation, reinforced through instruction tuning to incorporate logical order, transitions, and relationships within the model.

Result: Experimental results indicate that STIG generates multi-stage text in one inference without requiring traditional workflows. It outperforms other baselines in terms of semantic similarity and structural rationality.

Conclusion: STIG effectively eliminates the need for external workflows by enabling LLMs to handle complex text generation tasks independently, producing logically coherent and well-structured research introductions.

Abstract: In recent years, using predefined agentic workflows to guide large language models (LLMs) for literature classification and review has become a research focus. However, writing research introductions is more challenging. It requires rigorous logic, coherent structure, and abstract summarization. Existing workflows often suffer from long reasoning chains, error accumulation, and reduced textual coherence. To address these limitations, we propose eliminating external agentic workflows. Instead, we directly parameterize their logical structure into the LLM. This allows the generation of a complete introduction in a single inference. To this end, we introduce the Stage Token for Introduction Generation (STIG). STIG converts the multiple stages of the original workflow into explicit stage signals. These signals guide the model to follow different logical roles and functions during generation. Through instruction tuning, the model learns the mapping between stage tokens and text functions. It also learns the logical order and transition patterns between stages, encoding this knowledge into the model parameters. Experimental results show that STIG can generate multi-stage text in a single inference. It does not require explicit workflow calls. STIG outperforms traditional agentic workflows and other baselines on metrics of semantic similarity and sentence-level structural rationality. The code is provided in the Supplementary Materials.

*Tohida Rehman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid summarization framework for generating reliable summaries of earnings conference calls, combining extractive and abstractive techniques to improve accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual analysis of lengthy financial reports and earnings calls is labor-intensive, error-prone, and biased. Automated summarization can address these challenges in extracting actionable business insights.

Method: The study combines extractive LexRank for identifying salient sentences and fine-tuned abstractive models, including BART and PEGASUS, along with Longformer Encoder-Decoder models specialized in long-context dependencies.

Result: The hybrid summarization system demonstrates competitive performance in factual consistency under computational constraints, while long-context models offer the strongest overall accuracy. Detailed evaluations are conducted using metrics like ROUGE, METEOR, and FinBERTScore.

Conclusion: The findings support the development of efficient systems for summarizing financial documents, balancing computational efficiency with factual accuracy to produce actionable business insights.

Abstract: Financial reports and earnings communications contain large volumes of structured and semi structured information, making detailed manual analysis inefficient. Earnings conference calls provide valuable evidence about a firm's performance, outlook, and strategic priorities. The manual analysis of lengthy call transcripts requires substantial effort and is susceptible to interpretive bias and unintentional error. In this work, we present a hybrid summarization framework that combines extractive and abstractive techniques to produce concise and factually reliable Reuters-style summaries from the ECTSum dataset. The proposed two stage pipeline first applies the LexRank algorithm to identify salient sentences, which are subsequently summarized using fine-tuned variants of BART and PEGASUS designed for resource constrained settings. In parallel, we fine-tune a Longformer Encoder-Decoder (LED) model to directly capture long-range contextual dependencies in financial documents.
  Model performance is evaluated using standard automatic metrics, including ROUGE, METEOR, MoverScore, and BERTScore, along with domain-specific variants such as SciBERTScore and FinBERTScore. To assess factual accuracy, we further employ entity-level measures based on source-precision and F1-target. The results highlight complementary trade offs between approaches, long context models yield the strongest overall performance, while the hybrid framework achieves competitive results with improved factual consistency under computational constraints. These findings support the development of practical summarization systems for efficiently distilling lengthy financial texts into usable business insights.

*Kurt Miller,Qiuhao Lu,William Hersh,Kirk Roberts,Steven Bedrick,Andrew Wen,Hongfang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper reviews methods for extracting metadata from clinical documents, highlighting trends, applications, and gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of harmonizing heterogeneous clinical document metadata for improved interpretation and application.

Method: A scoping review following PRISMA-ScR guidelines, reviewing 67 relevant articles on clinical document metadata extraction.

Result: Identified trends showing a progression from rule-based methods to transformer-based architectures leveraging large language models. Sparse labeled datasets exist outside of section structure data.

Conclusion: Future research will likely focus on richer metadata representations and deeper integration into clinical workflows.

Abstract: Clinical document metadata, such as document type, structure, author role, medical specialty, and encounter setting, is essential for accurate interpretation of information captured in clinical documents. However, vast documentation heterogeneity and drift over time challenge harmonization of document metadata. Automated extraction methods have emerged to coalesce metadata from disparate practices into target schema. This scoping review aims to catalog research on clinical document metadata extraction, identify methodological trends and applications, and highlight gaps. We followed the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines to identify articles that perform clinical document metadata extraction. We initially found and screened 266 articles published between January 2011 and August 2025, then comprehensively reviewed 67 we deemed relevant to our study. Among the articles included, 45 were methodological, 17 used document metadata as features in a downstream application, and 5 analyzed document metadata composition. We observe myriad purposes for methodological study and application types. Available labelled public data remains sparse except for structural section datasets. Methods for extracting document metadata have progressed from largely rule-based and traditional machine learning with ample feature engineering to transformer-based architectures with minimal feature engineering. The emergence of large language models has enabled broader exploration of generalizability across tasks and datasets, allowing the possibility of advanced clinical text processing systems. We anticipate that research will continue to expand into richer document metadata representations and integrate further into clinical applications and workflows.

Motivation: The motivation is to understand and evaluate the semantic geometry of multilingual embeddings, addressing their systematic patterns and weaknesses across linguistic levels.

Method: The study employs Semanscope, a visualization framework combining PHATE manifold learning to analyze various datasets spanning from sub-character to character, word, and numerical levels.

Result: Key findings include geometric collapses in Chinese radicals, distinct geometric patterns in writing systems, semantic domain clustering across three languages, and spiral trajectories of Arabic numbers that challenge distributional semantics.

Conclusion: PHATE-based manifold learning is proven to be invaluable for analyzing geometric structures and for evaluating current embedding models' ability to capture semantic relationships effectively.

Abstract: We introduce a multi-level analysis framework for examining semantic geometry in multilingual embeddings, implemented through Semanscope (a visualization tool that applies PHATE manifold learning across four linguistic levels). Analysis of diverse datasets spanning sub-character components, alphabetic systems, semantic domains, and numerical concepts reveals systematic geometric patterns and critical limitations in current embedding models. At the sub-character level, purely structural elements (Chinese radicals) exhibit geometric collapse, highlighting model failures to distinguish semantic from structural components. At the character level, different writing systems show distinct geometric signatures. At the word level, content words form clustering-branching patterns across 20 semantic domains in English, Chinese, and German. Arabic numbers organize through spiral trajectories rather than clustering, violating standard distributional semantics assumptions. These findings establish PHATE manifold learning as an essential analytic tool not only for studying geometric structure of meaning in embedding space, but also for validating the effectiveness of embedding models in capturing semantic relationships.

### [75] [Benchmarking Cross-Lingual Semantic Alignment in Multilingual Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09732)
*Wen G. Gong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a semantic benchmarking framework, Semanscope, using a new metric, Semantic Affinity (SA), to evaluate cross-lingual semantic alignment across multilingual embedding models. Results show explicit translation supervision is key for high alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practitioners struggle to differentiate between multilingual embedding models that offer true cross-lingual semantic alignment and those that succeed through language-specific patterns, as task-driven benchmarks often fail to capture alignment issues.

Method: The authors propose Semantic Affinity (SA), a metric assessing the inter-lingual to intra-lingual spread ratio using cosine distance. They also use PHATE visualization in the Semanscope framework and benchmark 13 models across 4 datasets.

Result: The study identifies a three-tier structure among models: top BERT models with high alignment due to translation-pair supervision; LLM embeddings with mid-range SA scores regardless of scale; and MLM-only BERT models with poor alignment. Training objective, not architecture or model scale, is the key determinant of alignment.

Conclusion: Explicit translation supervision is critical for achieving cross-lingual semantic alignment in multilingual embeddings. The proposed Semanscope framework and Semantic Affinity metric help practitioners select alignment-oriented models.

Abstract: With hundreds of multilingual embedding models available, practitioners lack clear guidance on which provide genuine cross-lingual semantic alignment versus task performance through language-specific patterns. Task-driven benchmarks (MTEB) may mask fundamental alignment shortcomings. We introduce Semantic Affinity (SA), a bounded (between 0 and 1) metric measuring inter-lingual to intra-lingual spread ratio using cosine distance, combined with PHATE visualization in our Semanscope framework. Benchmarking 13 models across 4 datasets (52 experiments) reveals a three-tier structure: (1) Top BERT models (LaBSE SA = 0.70, USE SA = 0.68, S-BERT SA = 0.68) achieve strong alignment via translation-pair supervision; (2) LLM embeddings plateau at SA between 0.55 and 0.61 regardless of 0.6 B to 8 B scale; (3) MLM-only BERT models (mBERT, XLM-R, SA < 0.50) fail despite more than 100 language training. Training objective, not architecture or scale, determines alignment. Oracle Bone primitives (1200 BCE) expose semantic drift-models learn corpus patterns rather than cognitive primitives. This work provides semantic benchmarking to help practitioners select quality multilingual embeddings from hundreds of available models, showing cross-lingual alignment requires explicit translation supervision, not merely model scale or multilingual data.

### [76] [SurgGoal: Rethinking Surgical Planning Evaluation via Goal-Satisfiability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10455)
*Ruochen Li,Kun Yuan,Yufei Xia,Yue Zhou,Qingyu Lu,Weihang Li,Youxiang Zhu,Nassir Navab*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenges of evaluating vision-language models (VLMs) in surgical planning and proposes a new meta-evaluation benchmark based on goal satisfiability to test their correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is driven by the need to assess whether vision-language models are reliable and effective for safety-critical surgical planning tasks.

Method: The authors proposed a benchmark for evaluating models using expert-defined surgical rules, valid procedural variations, and invalid plans with order/content errors. They tested models under constrained settings using a rule-based satisfaction metric.

Result: Sequence similarity metrics are found inadequate in judging planning quality. Rule-based metrics better identified failures, indicating that structural and semantic knowledge are key for improving VLM performance.

Conclusion: Structural guidance is essential for improving planning quality in Video-LLMs, and semantic guidance can help larger models when combined with structured constraints.

Abstract: Surgical planning integrates visual perception, long-horizon reasoning, and procedural knowledge, yet it remains unclear whether current evaluation protocols reliably assess vision-language models (VLMs) in safety-critical settings. Motivated by a goal-oriented view of surgical planning, we define planning correctness via phase-goal satisfiability, where plan validity is determined by expert-defined surgical rules. Based on this definition, we introduce a multicentric meta-evaluation benchmark with valid procedural variations and invalid plans containing order and content errors. Using this benchmark, we show that sequence similarity metrics systematically misjudge planning quality, penalizing valid plans while failing to identify invalid ones. We therefore adopt a rule-based goal-satisfiability metric as a high-precision meta-evaluation reference to assess Video-LLMs under progressively constrained settings, revealing failures due to perception errors and under-constrained reasoning. Structural knowledge consistently improves performance, whereas semantic guidance alone is unreliable and benefits larger models only when combined with structural constraints.

### [77] [Closing the Data Loop: Using OpenDataArena to Engineer Superior Training Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09733)
*Xin Gao,Xiaoyang Wang,Yun Zhu,Mengzhang Cai,Conghui He,Lijun Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces an innovative closed-loop framework, OpenDataArena (ODA), for constructing supervised fine-tuning datasets to improve large language model performance. The approach is data-centric and relies on systematic feedback mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the inadequacies in current practices of constructing supervised fine-tuning datasets for large language models, which often rely on heuristic aggregation without considering dataset quality and sample contributions.

Method: The authors proposed OpenDataArena (ODA), a framework using value-anchored rankings and multi-dimensional analysis for dataset construction. They created two datasets—ODA-Math-460k (for mathematical reasoning) and ODA-Mixture (multi-domain instruction), employing tailored strategies for data efficiency and accuracy.

Result: Empirical results demonstrate that ODA-driven datasets outperform traditional datasets both in domain-specific tasks and general utility, achieving state-of-the-art benchmarks with superior data efficiency.

Conclusion: The research validates the importance of transitioning to data-centric AI, emphasizing the role of transparent and systematic evaluation in creating high-quality datasets for fine-tuning large language models.

Abstract: The construction of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) datasets is a critical yet under-theorized stage in the post-training of Large Language Models (LLMs), as prevalent practices often rely on heuristic aggregation without a systematic understanding of how individual samples contribute to model performance. In this report, we propose a paradigm shift from ad-hoc curation to a closed-loop dataset engineering framework using OpenDataArena (ODA), which leverages value-anchored rankings and multi-dimensional analysis to transform value benchmarking into feedback signals guiding dataset construction. We instantiate this methodology through two new datasets: \textbf{ODA-Math-460k}, a specialized mathematics reasoning dataset that utilizes a novel two-stage difficulty-aware pipeline to achieve State-of-the-Art (SOTA) results on benchmarks such as AIME and HMMT, and \textbf{ODA-Mixture (100k \& 500k)}, a series of multi-domain instruction datasets built via an ``Anchor-and-Patch'' strategy that outperforms significantly larger open-source baselines. Our empirical results demonstrate that ODA-driven datasets significantly improve both domain-specific reasoning and general utility while achieving superior data efficiency, validating a transition toward data-centric AI where transparent evaluation serves as the primary engine for engineering high-quality training data.

*Yanyi Liu,Qingwen Yang,Tiezheng Guo,Feiyu Qu,Jun Liu,Yingyou Wen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) by introducing a new research paradigm of "diagnosis" rather than "detection," proposing methods to locate, explain, and fix errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of interpretable feedback for improving LLMs when hallucinations are detected, and to provide actionable solutions for reliable deployment in critical domains.

Method: The authors propose the Hallucination Diagnosis Task and develop the Hallucination Diagnosis Generator (HDG), a pipeline for creating diagnostic training data using multi-dimensional augmentation. They then train a 4-billion-parameter diagnosis model using Group Relative Policy Optimization with a multi-factor reward system.

Result: The proposed HDM-4B-RL model outperforms prior detection models on hallucination evaluation benchmarks and achieves capabilities comparable to larger general-purpose models in diagnostic tasks, despite being smaller in size.

Conclusion: The study introduces a viable new methodology for combatting hallucinations in LLMs, showing its potential for enhancing the reliability and trustworthiness of generative AI systems.

Abstract: Hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs), defined as the generation of content inconsistent with facts or context, represent a core obstacle to their reliable deployment in critical domains. Current research primarily focuses on binary "detection" approaches that, while capable of identifying hallucinations, fail to provide interpretable and actionable feedback for model improvement, thus limiting practical utility. To address this limitation, a new research paradigm is proposed, shifting from "detection" to "diagnosis". The Hallucination Diagnosis Task is introduced, a task which requires models to not only detect hallucinations, but also perform error localization, causal explanation, and content correction. We develop the Hallucination Diagnosis Generator (HDG), an automated pipeline that systematically generates high-quality training samples with rich diagnostic metadata from raw corpora through multi-dimensional augmentation strategies including controlled fact fabrication and reasoning chain perturbation. Using HDG-generated data, we train HDM-4B-RL, a 4-billion-parameter hallucination diagnosis model, employing Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a comprehensive reward function incorporating structural, accuracy, and localization signals. Experimental results demonstrate that our model surpasses previous state-of-the-art detection models on the HaluEval benchmark while achieving comparable performance to advanced general-purpose models. In comprehensive diagnosis tasks, HDM-4B-RL matches the capabilities of larger general models while maintaining a smaller size. This work validates the feasibility and value of hallucination diagnosis, providing an effective methodology for building more trustworthy and reliable generative AI systems.

### [79] [Stable and Explainable Personality Trait Evaluation in Large Language Models with Internal Activations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09833)
*Xiaoxu Ma,Xiangbo Zhang,Zhenyu Weng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Persona-Vector Neutrality Interpolation (PVNI) method for evaluating personality traits in Large Language Models (LLMs). This approach emphasizes stability and interpretability by using internal model activations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing questionnaire-based methods for assessing personality traits in LLMs lack stability and explanatory power due to sensitivity to prompts and role-play configurations.

Method: The PVNI method extracts a persona vector related to a target personality trait from the model's internal activations using contrastive prompts, then interpolates a neutral score for stable evaluation.

Result: The PVNI approach showed higher stability in assessing personality traits across diverse LLMs compared to traditional methods, even under varying questionnaire and role-play conditions.

Conclusion: PVNI provides a robust and explainable framework for evaluating personality traits in LLMs, addressing limitations of prior questionnaire-based methods.

Abstract: Evaluating personality traits in Large Language Models (LLMs) is key to model interpretation, comparison, and responsible deployment. However, existing questionnaire-based evaluation methods exhibit limited stability and offer little explainability, as their results are highly sensitive to minor variations in prompt phrasing or role-play configurations. To address these limitations, we propose an internal-activation-based approach, termed Persona-Vector Neutrality Interpolation (PVNI), for stable and explainable personality trait evaluation in LLMs. PVNI extracts a persona vector associated with a target personality trait from the model's internal activations using contrastive prompts. It then estimates the corresponding neutral score by interpolating along the persona vector as an anchor axis, enabling an interpretable comparison between the neutral prompt representation and the persona direction. We provide a theoretical analysis of the effectiveness and generalization properties of PVNI. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs demonstrate that PVNI yields substantially more stable personality trait evaluations than existing methods, even under questionnaire and role-play variants.

*Sriram Padmanabhan,Siyuan Song,Kanishka Misra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper tests if Vision Language Models (VLMs) replicate human behavior in differentiating generic, universally quantified, and indefinite plural statements, as seen in children, and finds alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to examine whether general-purpose statistical learners like VLMs can reflect the subtle constraints language places on inductive inferences, similar to human behavior.

Method: The authors replicate a developmental experiment with VLMs, involving precondition tests and tasks to investigate sensitivity to generic, universal, and indefinite plural statements, followed by representation analyses.

Result: The VLMs showed behavioral alignment with humans in distinguishing different language propositions and revealed that their representation organization relied on inductive constraints rather than surface-form differences.

Conclusion: VLMs are capable of exhibiting human-like inductive behaviors influenced by linguistic constraints, which shows potential for modeling human linguistic reasoning.

Abstract: Language places subtle constraints on how we make inductive inferences. Developmental evidence by Gelman et al. (2002) has shown children (4 years and older) to differentiate among generic statements ("Bears are daxable"), universally quantified NPs ("all bears are daxable") and indefinite plural NPs ("some bears are daxable") in extending novel properties to a specific member (all > generics > some), suggesting that they represent these types of propositions differently. We test if these subtle differences arise in general purpose statistical learners like Vision Language Models, by replicating the original experiment. On tasking them through a series of precondition tests (robust identification of categories in images and sensitivities to all and some), followed by the original experiment, we find behavioral alignment between models and humans. Post-hoc analyses on their representations revealed that these differences are organized based on inductive constraints and not surface-form differences.

*Sraavya Sambara,Yuan Pu,Ayman Ali,Vishala Mishra,Lionel Wong,Monica Agrawal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates large language models' (LLMs) ability to respond safely to real-world medical questions that contain false premises. It reveals gaps in their performance compared to clinicians.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the limitations of LLMs in safely addressing medical queries with embedded false assumptions, given their increasing utilization by lay users for medical advice.

Method: A semi-automated pipeline was developed to construct the 'MedRedFlag' dataset of 1100+ health questions requiring redirection. The study systematically compared answers from state-of-the-art LLMs to clinicians’ responses.

Result: LLMs often fail to redirect questions with false premises appropriately, which could lead to poor medical decisions. Clinicians outperformed LLMs in addressing such queries.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize significant safety concerns with the deployment of LLMs in patient-facing medical communication, urging further improvements in their reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Real-world health questions from patients often unintentionally embed false assumptions or premises. In such cases, safe medical communication typically involves redirection: addressing the implicit misconception and then responding to the underlying patient context, rather than the original question. While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used by lay users for medical advice, they have not yet been tested for this crucial competency. Therefore, in this work, we investigate how LLMs react to false premises embedded within real-world health questions. We develop a semi-automated pipeline to curate MedRedFlag, a dataset of 1100+ questions sourced from Reddit that require redirection. We then systematically compare responses from state-of-the-art LLMs to those from clinicians. Our analysis reveals that LLMs often fail to redirect problematic questions, even when the problematic premise is detected, and provide answers that could lead to suboptimal medical decision making. Our benchmark and results reveal a novel and substantial gap in how LLMs perform under the conditions of real-world health communication, highlighting critical safety concerns for patient-facing medical AI systems.

*Yilin Bao,Ziyao He,Zayden Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The authors propose a reinforcement learning framework for scientific paper generation that enhances document planning, factual grounding, and citation consistency, significantly outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large language models fail to address issues like global structure, input coverage, and citation consistency in creating scientific papers.

Method: The paper introduces a reinforcement learning framework using structured actions for outline evolution, along with a two-stage optimization procedure to improve learning stability and structural consistency.

Result: The proposed model outperforms strong baseline models in structural coherence, scientific correctness, and citation fidelity based on a newly introduced evaluation benchmark.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates that reinforcement learning can significantly enhance the quality and consistency of scientific paper generation, addressing existing limitations of traditional language models.

Abstract: Scientific paper generation requires document-level planning and factual grounding, but current large language models, despite their strong local fluency, often fail in global structure, input coverage, and citation consistency. We present a reinforcement learning framework that casts scientific outline construction as a long-horizon planning problem over hierarchical document structures. Our approach models edit evolving outlines through structured actions, enabling the system to incrementally build a complete scientific manuscript. To support effective and stabilize learning,we introduce a two-stage optimization procedure consisting of (i) backward outline reconstruction from partial plans to enforce global structural consistency, and (ii) forward value-guided reinforcement learning with rewards explicitly modeling scientific correctness, discourse coherence, and citation fidelity. In addition, We further introduce a benchmark for scientific paper generation that evaluates document planning, input utilization, reference faithfulness, outline organization, and content-level factual accuracy. Our results show consistent improvements over strong neural and LLM baselines, particularly in long-range structural coherence and citation reliability.

*Yifei Shen,Yilun Zhao,Justice Ou,Tinglin Huang,Arman Cohan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLINSQL is a benchmark created to address challenges in clinical text-to-SQL query generation for EHR data. It evaluates models' ability to perform complex reasoning and produce executable queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for clinically reliable text-to-SQL systems capable of generating executable SQL queries for complex, real-world EHR data containing heterogeneous tables, temporal data, and patient cohorts.

Method: The researchers introduced CLINSQL, a dataset containing 633 expert-annotated tasks targeting multi-table joins, clinically meaningful filters, and executable SQL. Models were evaluated on this dataset using Chain-of-Thought refinement and rubric-based SQL analysis with execution validations.

Result: Quantitative evaluation shows that state-of-the-art models like GPT-5-mini and others achieve limited performance (e.g., 74.7% execution score for GPT-5-mini) on CLINSQL, demonstrating the current gap to clinical usability.

Conclusion: The development and evaluation of CLINSQL highlight the progress toward making clinical text-to-SQL systems more reliable, but significant challenges remain before they can be utilized reliably in real-world EHR analytics.

Abstract: Real-world clinical text-to-SQL requires reasoning over heterogeneous EHR tables, temporal windows, and patient-similarity cohorts to produce executable queries. We introduce CLINSQL, a benchmark of 633 expert-annotated tasks on MIMIC-IV v3.1 that demands multi-table joins, clinically meaningful filters, and executable SQL. Solving CLINSQL entails navigating schema metadata and clinical coding systems, handling long contexts, and composing multi-step queries beyond traditional text-to-SQL. We evaluate 22 proprietary and open-source models under Chain-of-Thought self-refinement and use rubric-based SQL analysis with execution checks that prioritize critical clinical requirements. Despite recent advances, performance remains far from clinical reliability: on the test set, GPT-5-mini attains 74.7% execution score, DeepSeek-R1 leads open-source at 69.2% and Gemini-2.5-Pro drops from 85.5% on Easy to 67.2% on Hard. Progress on CLINSQL marks tangible advances toward clinically reliable text-to-SQL for real-world EHR analytics.

*Sathvik Nair,Byung-Doh Oh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates why language model (LM) probabilities outperform cloze task-based probabilities in predicting processing effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why LM probabilities perform better than cloze task responses as predictors of processing effort, and whether LM probabilities contribute to accurate scientific conclusions about language comprehension.

Method: The authors tested hypotheses including low resolution, semantic similarity distinctions, and handling of low-frequency words to explain LM probabilities’ advantage.

Result: LM probabilities show advantages in resolution, semantic distinctions, and low-frequency word probability assignments, calling for improvement in cloze studies' resolution.

Conclusion: Efforts should focus on enhancing cloze study resolution and experimenting on whether human-like prediction aligns with the fine-grained sensitivity of LM probabilities.

Abstract: How predictable a word is can be quantified in two ways: using human responses to the cloze task or using probabilities from language models (LMs).When used as predictors of processing effort, LM probabilities outperform probabilities derived from cloze data. However, it is important to establish that LM probabilities do so for the right reasons, since different predictors can lead to different scientific conclusions about the role of prediction in language comprehension. We present evidence for three hypotheses about the advantage of LM probabilities: not suffering from low resolution, distinguishing semantically similar words, and accurately assigning probabilities to low-frequency words. These results call for efforts to improve the resolution of cloze studies, coupled with experiments on whether human-like prediction is also as sensitive to the fine-grained distinctions made by LM probabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines using open-source large language models (LLMs) to estimate the difficulty of math test items by simulating student performance and applying Item Response Theory to compare predictions against real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human pilot studies to evaluate math question difficulty are expensive and time-intensive. This study aims to explore whether LLMs can cost-effectively predict test question difficulty for real-world students.

Method: The authors created simulated “classrooms” by prompting LLMs to role-play 4th, 8th, or 12th-grade students with different proficiency levels. They applied Item Response Theory (IRT) to estimate difficulty and compared these predictions to real-world difficulty metrics from NAEP data.

Result: Correlations between simulated difficulty estimates and real-world data reached up to 0.82 for certain grade levels. Role-playing techniques, particularly involving named and demographically-diverse student personas, improved prediction accuracy. Weaker mathematical LLMs outperformed stronger ones in this task.

Conclusion: Open-source LLMs can effectively predict math question difficulty using simulation and IRT, offering a cost-effective alternative to traditional human-based pilot studies. Surprisingly, less mathematically advanced LLMs performed better in this context.

Abstract: Standardized math assessments require expensive human pilot studies to establish the difficulty of test items. We investigate the predictive value of open-source large language models (LLMs) for evaluating the difficulty of multiple-choice math questions for real-world students. We show that, while LLMs are poor direct judges of problem difficulty, simulation-based approaches with LLMs yield promising results under the right conditions. Under the proposed approach, we simulate a "classroom" of 4th, 8th, or 12th grade students by prompting the LLM to role-play students of varying proficiency levels. We use the outcomes of these simulations to fit Item Response Theory (IRT) models, comparing learned difficulty parameters for items to their real-world difficulties, as determined by item-level statistics furnished by the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). We observe correlations as high as 0.75, 0.76, and 0.82 for grades 4, 8, and 12, respectively. In our simulations, we experiment with different "classroom sizes," showing tradeoffs between computation size and accuracy. We find that role-plays with named students improves predictions (compared to student ids), and stratifying names across gender and race further improves predictions. Our results show that LLMs with relatively weaker mathematical abilities (Gemma) actually yield better real-world difficulty predictions than mathematically stronger models (Llama and Qwen), further underscoring the suitability of open-source models for the task.

*David Samuel Setiawan,Raphaël Merx,Jey Han Lau*

TL;DR: This paper proposes a hybrid NMT framework to address domain shift challenges in low-resource languages like Dhao, achieving significant performance recovery using Retrieval-Augmented Generation with an LLM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NMT models for low-resource languages often face domain shift issues, evidenced by performance drops when applied to unseen text domains. The paper uses Dhao, a language with limited digital resources, as a case study.

Method: The authors use an NMT model to generate drafts, which are then refined by a Large Language Model using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). They measure performance recovery using chrF++ scores.

Result: The proposed system recovers 8.10 chrF++ points, bringing the unseen domain translation quality close to the original in-domain quality. Performance is primarily influenced by the number of retrieved examples.

Conclusion: The hybrid framework effectively addresses domain shift challenges and demonstrates the potential of LLMs as a safety net for severe translation failures, even in zero-shot domains.

Abstract: Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models for low-resource languages suffer significant performance degradation under domain shift. We quantify this challenge using Dhao, an indigenous language of Eastern Indonesia with no digital footprint beyond the New Testament (NT). When applied to the unseen Old Testament (OT), a standard NMT model fine-tuned on the NT drops from an in-domain score of 36.17 chrF++ to 27.11 chrF++. To recover this loss, we introduce a hybrid framework where a fine-tuned NMT model generates an initial draft, which is then refined by a Large Language Model (LLM) using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The final system achieves 35.21 chrF++ (+8.10 recovery), effectively matching the original in-domain quality. Our analysis reveals that this performance is driven primarily by the number of retrieved examples rather than the choice of retrieval algorithm. Qualitative analysis confirms the LLM acts as a robust "safety net," repairing severe failures in zero-shot domains.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SocraticKG, a method for constructing better Knowledge Graphs (KGs) using question-answer pairs as an intermediate step to address trade-offs in current approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the trade-off between factual coverage and relational fragmentation in existing large language model-based KG construction methods.

Method: SocraticKG uses 5W1H-guided question-answer expansion to unfold document-level semantics before extracting triples, capturing contextual and implicit relational data.

Result: The proposed method outperforms existing pipelines in the MINE benchmark by improving factual retention and maintaining structural cohesion during KG construction.

Conclusion: QA-mediated semantic scaffolding enhances the coherence and reliability of KG construction systems by addressing both coverage and connectivity challenges.

Abstract: Constructing Knowledge Graphs (KGs) from unstructured text provides a structured framework for knowledge representation and reasoning, yet current LLM-based approaches struggle with a fundamental trade-off: factual coverage often leads to relational fragmentation, while premature consolidation causes information loss. To address this, we propose SocraticKG, an automated KG construction method that introduces question-answer pairs as a structured intermediate representation to systematically unfold document-level semantics prior to triple extraction. By employing 5W1H-guided QA expansion, SocraticKG captures contextual dependencies and implicit relational links typically lost in direct KG extraction pipelines, providing explicit grounding in the source document that helps mitigate implicit reasoning errors. Evaluation on the MINE benchmark demonstrates that our approach effectively addresses the coverage-connectivity trade-off, achieving superior factual retention while maintaining high structural cohesion even as extracted knowledge volume substantially expands. These results highlight that QA-mediated semantic scaffolding plays a critical role in structuring semantics prior to KG extraction, enabling more coherent and reliable graph construction in subsequent stages.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for practical QA systems that navigate heterogeneous and multimodal EHRs for clinical decision-making.

Method: Proposed EHRNavigator, a multi-agent AI-based framework for clinically relevant QA tasks across diverse, multimodal EHR datasets.

Result: EHRNavigator achieved 86% accuracy on real-world cases and maintained clinically acceptable response times under hospital conditions.

Conclusion: The framework bridges the gap between standard dataset evaluation and real-world clinical deployment, offering an efficient and adaptive solution for EHR navigation.

Abstract: Clinical decision-making increasingly relies on timely and context-aware access to patient information within Electronic Health Records (EHRs), yet most existing natural language question-answering (QA) systems are evaluated solely on benchmark datasets, limiting their practical relevance. To overcome this limitation, we introduce EHRNavigator, a multi-agent framework that harnesses AI agents to perform patient-level question answering across heterogeneous and multimodal EHR data. We assessed its performance using both public benchmark and institutional datasets under realistic hospital conditions characterized by diverse schemas, temporal reasoning demands, and multimodal evidence integration. Through quantitative evaluation and clinician-validated chart review, EHRNavigator demonstrated strong generalization, achieving 86% accuracy on real-world cases while maintaining clinically acceptable response times. Overall, these findings confirm that EHRNavigator effectively bridges the gap between benchmark evaluation and clinical deployment, offering a robust, adaptive, and efficient solution for real-world EHR question answering.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the complex emotional dynamics experienced by patients with chronic medical conditions, supporting better empathetic interaction modeling.

Method: The dataset comprises 4125 dialogues and 280 medical situations based on 28 emotion categories, validated from the GoEmotions taxonomy. It was collected via crowdsourcing and expert review. Evaluation utilized BERTScore and LLM fine-tuning for emotional alignment.

They often experience a wide range of positive and negative emotions (e.g., hope and despair) that shift across different stages of disease management. EmplifAI addresses this complexity by providing situation-based dialogues grounded in 28 fine-grained emotion categories, adapted and validated from the GoEmotions taxonomy. The dataset includes 280 medically contextualized situations and 4125 two-turn dialogues, collected through crowdsourcing and expert review. To evaluate emotional alignment in empathetic dialogues, we assessed model predictions on situation--dialogue pairs using BERTScore across multiple large language models (LLMs), achieving F1 scores of 0.83. Fine-tuning a baseline Japanese LLM (LLM-jp-3.1-13b-instruct4) with EmplifAI resulted in notable improvements in fluency, general empathy, and emotion-specific empathy. Furthermore, we compared the scores assigned by LLM-as-a-Judge and human raters on dialogues generated by multiple LLMs to validate our evaluation pipeline and discuss the insights and potential risks derived from the correlation analysis.

### [90] [Long-Chain Reasoning Distillation via Adaptive Prefix Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10064)
*Zhenghao Liu,Zhuoyang Wu,Xinze Li,Yukun Yan,Shuo Wang,Zulong Chen,Yu Gu,Ge Yu,Maosong Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces P-ALIGN, a distillation framework that focuses on improving mathematical reasoning in small-scale student models using adaptive prefix alignment to handle long teacher reasoning trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve reasoning performance in student language models using large teacher models, addressing the mismatch caused by overly complex reasoning trajectories of teachers.

Method: Proposed P-ALIGN framework adaptively truncates teacher CoTs, assesses the sufficiency of remaining reasoning suffixes, and uses teacher-generated prefixes to supervise student models for enhanced alignment.

Result: Experiments on mathematical benchmarks show P-ALIGN outperforms baselines by over 3%, delivering effective supervision signals while avoiding negative effects from redundant teacher reasoning.

Conclusion: P-ALIGN successfully aligns student models with teacher reasoning using adaptive prefix techniques, improving performance and avoiding the complexity of teacher trajectories.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities, particularly in solving complex mathematical problems. Recent studies show that distilling long reasoning trajectories can effectively enhance the reasoning performance of small-scale student models. However, teacher-generated reasoning trajectories are often excessively long and structurally complex, making them difficult for student models to learn. This mismatch leads to a gap between the provided supervision signal and the learning capacity of the student model. To address this challenge, we propose Prefix-ALIGNment distillation (P-ALIGN), a framework that fully exploits teacher CoTs for distillation through adaptive prefix alignment. Specifically, P-ALIGN adaptively truncates teacher-generated reasoning trajectories by determining whether the remaining suffix is concise and sufficient to guide the student model. Then, P-ALIGN leverages the teacher-generated prefix to supervise the student model, encouraging effective prefix alignment. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that P-ALIGN outperforms all baselines by over 3%. Further analysis indicates that the prefixes constructed by P-ALIGN provide more effective supervision signals, while avoiding the negative impact of redundant and uncertain reasoning components.

### [91] [Deriving Character Logic from Storyline as Codified Decision Trees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10080)
*Letian Peng,Kun Zhou,Longfei Yun,Yupeng Hou,Jingbo Shang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Codified Decision Trees (CDT) offer a data-driven approach to create reliable role-playing (RP) agents by structuring behavioral profiles as executable decision trees, improving performance in diverse narrative contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing role-playing agent profiles are often unstructured, non-executable, and poorly validated, resulting in inconsistent behavior across different scenarios.

Method: A data-driven codified decision tree framework was developed, representing profiles as conditional decision structures derived from narrative data, validated, and refined for transparency and usability.

Result: CDT significantly outperformed human-written profiles and prior methods across benchmarks with 85 characters in 16 artifacts, showcasing improved reliability and agent grounding.

Conclusion: Codified and validated decision tree-based profiles enhance the consistency and reliability of RP agents in narrative settings, highlighting the advantages of structured and interpretable behavioral models.

Abstract: Role-playing (RP) agents rely on behavioral profiles to act consistently across diverse narrative contexts, yet existing profiles are largely unstructured, non-executable, and weakly validated, leading to brittle agent behavior. We propose Codified Decision Trees (CDT), a data-driven framework that induces an executable and interpretable decision structure from large-scale narrative data. CDT represents behavioral profiles as a tree of conditional rules, where internal nodes correspond to validated scene conditions and leaves encode grounded behavioral statements, enabling deterministic retrieval of context-appropriate rules at execution time. The tree is learned by iteratively inducing candidate scene-action rules, validating them against data, and refining them through hierarchical specialization, yielding profiles that support transparent inspection and principled updates. Across multiple benchmarks, CDT substantially outperforms human-written profiles and prior profile induction methods on $85$ characters across $16$ artifacts, indicating that codified and validated behavioral representations lead to more reliable agent grounding.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates commercial machine translation (MT) systems for low-resource languages in crisis contexts using the TICO-19 dataset to assess readiness for future pandemics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the communication gap between aid providers and affected communities during crises, particularly due to language barriers.

Method: The authors used four commercial MT systems and assessed their translation quality for pandemic-related sentences in low-resource languages from the TICO-19 dataset.

Result: The paper measured the usability of MT output translations, examining their effectiveness for high-priority, low-resource crisis-affected languages.

Conclusion: MT systems show promise but require further improvements to better serve low-resource language communities in crisis and medical domains.

Abstract: Communication in times of crisis is essential. However, there is often a mismatch between the language of governments, aid providers, doctors, and those to whom they are providing aid. Commercial MT systems are reasonable tools to turn to in these scenarios. But how effective are these tools for translating to and from low resource languages, particularly in the crisis or medical domain? In this study, we evaluate four commercial MT systems using the TICO-19 dataset, which is composed of pandemic-related sentences from a large set of high priority languages spoken by communities most likely to be affected adversely in the next pandemic. We then assess the current degree of ``readiness'' for another pandemic (or epidemic) based on the usability of the output translations.

*Viet Cuong Nguyen,Nhi Yen Nguyen,Kristin A. Candan,Mary Conlon,Vanessa Rumie,Kristen Risola,Srijan Kumar,Munmun De Choudhury*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CALM-IT is a framework designed to improve long-form therapeutic dialogues in mental health settings using Large Language Models (LLMs). It focuses on maintaining conversational coherence over extended interactions by modeling dual-actor dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs currently struggle with sustaining goal-directed, coherent conversations in mental health applications due to local optimization and long-horizon drift.

Method: CALM-IT employs a bidirectional state-space process modeling therapist-client interactions, continuously updating inferred alignment, mental states, and goals for strategy selection and dialogue generation.

Result: CALM-IT consistently outperforms strong baselines in effectiveness and goal alignment, maintaining stability in long conversations. It achieves the highest client acceptance rate, indicating precise therapeutic timing.

Conclusion: Modeling evolving conversational states is crucial for generating coherent and effective long-form synthetic conversations in mental health-related contexts.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in mental health-related settings, yet they struggle to sustain realistic, goal-directed dialogue over extended interactions. While LLMs generate fluent responses, they optimize locally for the next turn rather than maintaining a coherent model of therapeutic progress, leading to brittleness and long-horizon drift. We introduce CALM-IT, a framework for generating and evaluating long-form Motivational Interviewing (MI) dialogues that explicitly models dual-actor conversational dynamics. CALM-IT represents therapist-client interaction as a bidirectional state-space process, in which both agents continuously update inferred alignment, mental states, and short-term goals to guide strategy selection and utterance generation. Across large-scale evaluations, CALM-IT consistently outperforms strong baselines in Effectiveness and Goal Alignment and remains substantially more stable as conversation length increases. Although CALM-IT initiates fewer therapist redirections, it achieves the highest client acceptance rate (64.3%), indicating more precise and therapeutically aligned intervention timing. Overall, CALM-IT provides evidence for modeling evolving conversational state being essential for generating high-quality long-form synthetic conversations.

### [94] [SIN-Bench: Tracing Native Evidence Chains in Long-Context Multimodal Scientific Interleaved Literature](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10108)
*Yiming Ren,Junjie Wang,Yuxin Meng,Yihang Shi,Zhiqiang Lin,Ruihang Chu,Yiran Xu,Ziming Li,Yunfei Zhao,Zihan Wang,Yu Qiao,Ruiming Tang,Minghao Liu,Yujiu Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the 'Fish-in-the-Ocean' (FITO) paradigm to evaluate if multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can effectively reason using detailed, evidence-linked traces within scientific papers. It reveals challenges with grounding and proposes SIN-Data and SIN-Bench benchmarks for more comprehensive assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods for MLLMs, such as answer-only metrics, fail to measure true understanding of scientific papers since they lack causal and evidence-based reasoning. This paper aims to propose a new evaluation paradigm for addressing this gap.

Method: The paper introduces the FITO paradigm, operationalized using a dataset called SIN-Data, which maintains the native integration of text and figures in scientific documents. Four tasks form the SIN-Bench benchmarks: evidence discovery, hypothesis verification, grounded QA, and evidence-anchored synthesis. A new scoring metric, 'No Evidence, No Score,' ensures predictions are accompanied by verifiable anchors.

Result: Testing eight MLLMs showed that evidence grounding is the major limitation. Gemini-3-pro achieved the highest overall score, while GPT-5 had the best answer accuracy for SIN-QA but struggled with evidence-aligned scores, highlighting discrepancies between accuracy and traceable support.

Conclusion: Accurate answers alone do not signify true understanding in MLLMs; grounding and evidence alignment remain critical challenges. The authors propose their benchmarks and datasets as tools to drive improvement in these areas.

Abstract: Evaluating whether multimodal large language models truly understand long-form scientific papers remains challenging: answer-only metrics and synthetic "Needle-In-A-Haystack" tests often reward answer matching without requiring a causal, evidence-linked reasoning trace in the document. We propose the "Fish-in-the-Ocean" (FITO) paradigm, which requires models to construct explicit cross-modal evidence chains within native scientific documents. To operationalize FITO, we build SIN-Data, a scientific interleaved corpus that preserves the native interleaving of text and figures. On top of it, we construct SIN-Bench with four progressive tasks covering evidence discovery (SIN-Find), hypothesis verification (SIN-Verify), grounded QA (SIN-QA), and evidence-anchored synthesis (SIN-Summary). We further introduce "No Evidence, No Score", scoring predictions when grounded to verifiable anchors and diagnosing evidence quality via matching, relevance, and logic. Experiments on eight MLLMs show that grounding is the primary bottleneck: Gemini-3-pro achieves the best average overall score (0.573), while GPT-5 attains the highest SIN-QA answer accuracy (0.767) but underperforms on evidence-aligned overall scores, exposing a gap between correctness and traceable support.

*Lechen Zhang,Yunxiang Zhang,Wei Hu,Lu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a skill-centric distillation framework for improving reasoning abilities in weaker models with limited training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to develop data-efficient training methods due to the high cost of large-scale data requirements in distilling large reasoning models.

Method: Proposes skill-centric distillation involving skill-based data selection and skill-aware fine-tuning, focusing on specific weaker skills of the student models.

Result: With just 1,000 training examples, the method outperforms baselines by +1.6% on Qwen3-4B and +1.4% on Qwen3-8B in five mathematical reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Skill-centric training is effective for efficient reasoning ability transfer, especially by focusing on targeted skills during distillation.

Abstract: Large reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1 and their distilled variants achieve strong performance on complex reasoning tasks. Yet, distilling these models often demands large-scale data for supervised fine-tuning (SFT), motivating the pursuit of data-efficient training methods. To address this, we propose a skill-centric distillation framework that efficiently transfers reasoning ability to weaker models with two components: (1) Skill-based data selection, which prioritizes examples targeting the student model's weaker skills, and (2) Skill-aware fine-tuning, which encourages explicit skill decomposition during problem solving. With only 1,000 training examples selected from a 100K teacher-generated corpus, our method surpasses random SFT baselines by +1.6% on Qwen3-4B and +1.4% on Qwen3-8B across five mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Further analysis confirms that these gains concentrate on skills emphasized during training, highlighting the effectiveness of skill-centric training for efficient reasoning distillation.

*Yutao Mou,Zhangchi Xue,Lijun Li,Peiyang Liu,Shikun Zhang,Wei Ye,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the safety concern of LLM agents invoking external tools by proposing a benchmark (TS-Bench), a guardrail model (TS-Guard), and a reasoning framework (TS-Flow) to detect and mitigate unsafe behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying LLM agents in environments poses increased security risks due to the ability to invoke external tools, necessitating proactive monitoring and intervention to ensure safety.

Method: The authors construct TS-Bench for benchmarking step-level safety, develop TS-Guard using multi-task reinforcement learning for detecting unsafe actions, and introduce TS-Flow to integrate guardrail feedback into reasoning processes.

Result: TS-Guard effectively detects threats and provides safety judgments, while TS-Flow reduces harmful tool invocations by 65% and improves benign task completion by 10% under prompt injection attacks.

Conclusion: The proposed approaches improve safety and task efficiency in LLM agents, providing a practical solution for secure deployment in environments with external tool interactions.

Abstract: While LLM-based agents can interact with environments via invoking external tools, their expanded capabilities also amplify security risks. Monitoring step-level tool invocation behaviors in real time and proactively intervening before unsafe execution is critical for agent deployment, yet remains under-explored. In this work, we first construct TS-Bench, a novel benchmark for step-level tool invocation safety detection in LLM agents. We then develop a guardrail model, TS-Guard, using multi-task reinforcement learning. The model proactively detects unsafe tool invocation actions before execution by reasoning over the interaction history. It assesses request harmfulness and action-attack correlations, producing interpretable and generalizable safety judgments and feedback. Furthermore, we introduce TS-Flow, a guardrail-feedback-driven reasoning framework for LLM agents, which reduces harmful tool invocations of ReAct-style agents by 65 percent on average and improves benign task completion by approximately 10 percent under prompt injection attacks.

*Guimin Hu,Meng Li,Qiwei Peng,Lijie Hu,Boyan Xu,Ruichu Cai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates the activation patterns of experts in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models by categorizing them into domain and driver experts, identifying patterns, associations with tokens, and suggesting performance optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and improve the interpretability and functionality of expert-level behavior in MoE Large Language Models (LLMs), inspired by functional specialization observed in the human brain.

Method: The paper uses entropy-based and causal-effect metrics to identify whether experts are domain-specific or influence the model's output (driver experts). It also analyzes token-triggered expert activation patterns and studies the influence of adjusting expert weights.

Result: The analysis reveals that some experts prefer particular domains or have a significant causal role in performance; earlier tokens in sentences activate driver experts more frequently, and adjusting the weights of domain and driver experts leads to performance improvements.

Conclusion: The findings contribute to understanding the inner workings of MoE models, highlighting the importance of domain and driver experts to their functionality and interpretability, while improving overall model performance.

Abstract: Most interpretability work focuses on layer- or neuron-level mechanisms in Transformers, leaving expert-level behavior in MoE LLMs underexplored. Motivated by functional specialization in the human brain, we analyze expert activation by distinguishing domain and driver experts. In this work, we study expert activation in MoE models across three public domains and address two key questions: (1) which experts are activated, and whether certain expert types exhibit consistent activation patterns; and (2) how tokens are associated with and trigger the activation of specific experts. To answer these questions, we introduce entropy-based and causal-effect metrics to assess whether an expert is strongly favored for a particular domain, and how strongly expert activation contributes causally to the model's output, thus identify domain and driver experts, respectively. Furthermore, we explore how individual tokens are associated with the activation of specific experts. Our analysis reveals that (1) Among the activated experts, some show clear domain preferences, while others exert strong causal influence on model performance, underscoring their decisive roles. (2) tokens occurring earlier in a sentence are more likely to trigger the driver experts, and (3) adjusting the weights of domain and driver experts leads to significant performance gains across all three models and domains. These findings shed light on the internal mechanisms of MoE models and enhance their interpretability.

*Cameron Tice,Puria Radmard,Samuel Ratnam,Andy Kim,David Africa,Kyle O'Brien*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates the impact of pretraining data about AI systems on misalignment and alignment, finding a direct causal link.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if and how discourse about AI systems in pretraining corpora affects downstream alignment in language models.

Method: The authors pretrained 6.9B-parameter language models on datasets containing varying proportions of discourse about AI, particularly focused on alignment vs. misalignment.

Result: Upsampling documents about AI misalignment increased misaligned behavior, while upsampling documents about aligned behavior significantly reduced misalignment scores from 45% to 9%.

Conclusion: Pretraining data about AI systems shapes alignment priors in models. Practitioners should focus on alignment during pretraining to reduce misalignment and improve model behavior.

Abstract: Pretraining corpora contain extensive discourse about AI systems, yet the causal influence of this discourse on downstream alignment remains poorly understood. If prevailing descriptions of AI behaviour are predominantly negative, LLMs may internalise corresponding behavioural priors, giving rise to self-fulfilling misalignment. This paper provides the first controlled study of this hypothesis by pretraining 6.9B-parameter LLMs with varying amounts of (mis)alignment discourse. We find that discussion of AI contributes to misalignment. Upsampling synthetic training documents about AI misalignment leads to a notable increase in misaligned behaviour. Conversely, upsampling documents about aligned behaviour reduces misalignment scores from 45% to 9%. We consider this evidence of self-fulfilling alignment. These effects are dampened, but persist through post-training. Our findings establish the study of how pretraining data shapes alignment priors, or alignment pretraining, as a complement to post-training. We recommend practitioners pretrain for alignment as well as capabilities. Our models and datasets are available at alignmentpretraining.ai

TL;DR: The paper addresses a cross-lingual verbosity issue in multilingual translations by introducing the Sand-Glass benchmark for duration-constrained tasks and proposing the HOMURA framework to achieve length control and semantic preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the cross-lingual verbosity bias in LLMs, which impacts their effectiveness in time-constrained tasks like subtitling and dubbing.

Method: The authors introduce Sand-Glass benchmark to evaluate translations with syllable-level constraints, and develop HOMURA—a reinforcement learning method using a KL-regularized objective and dynamic syllable-ratio reward to optimize output length and semantic fidelity.

Result: Experiments show that HOMURA outperforms existing models, achieving precise length control while maintaining semantic accuracy, respecting linguistic density variations.

Conclusion: The study presents solutions to the verbosity issue in LLMs, advancing their usability in time-sensitive applications by balancing temporal constraints and semantic adequacy.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable strides in multilingual translation but are hindered by a systemic cross-lingual verbosity bias, rendering them unsuitable for strict time-constrained tasks like subtitling and dubbing. Current prompt-engineering approaches struggle to resolve this conflict between semantic fidelity and rigid temporal feasibility. To bridge this gap, we first introduce Sand-Glass, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate translation under syllable-level duration constraints. Furthermore, we propose HOMURA, a reinforcement learning framework that explicitly optimizes the trade-off between semantic preservation and temporal compliance. By employing a KL-regularized objective with a novel dynamic syllable-ratio reward, HOMURA effectively "tames" the output length. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms strong LLM baselines, achieving precise length control that respects linguistic density hierarchies without compromising semantic adequacy.

TL;DR: The paper introduces HUMANLLM, a framework for simulating human-like cognitive and behavioral patterns using psychological models, and demonstrates its improvement over existing large language models in achieving authentic anthropomorphism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of aligning Role-Playing Language Agents (RPLAs) with authentic human cognitive and behavioral patterns for more realistic interactions.

Method: The researchers developed HUMANLLM, a framework using psychological models and constructed 244 patterns from ~12,000 academic papers. They synthesized over 11,000 multi-pattern scenarios and used dual-level checklists to evaluate fidelity and emergent dynamics of these patterns.

Result: HUMANLLM-8B achieved high human alignment (r=0.91) and outperformed a larger model, Qwen3-32B, on simulating multi-pattern dynamics, despite having fewer parameters.

Conclusion: Authentic anthropomorphism for RPLAs requires cognitive modeling, focusing on simulating underlying psychological processes, not just surface behaviors.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in reasoning and generation, serving as the foundation for advanced persona simulation and Role-Playing Language Agents (RPLAs). However, achieving authentic alignment with human cognitive and behavioral patterns remains a critical challenge for these agents. We present HUMANLLM, a framework treating psychological patterns as interacting causal forces. We construct 244 patterns from ~12,000 academic papers and synthesize 11,359 scenarios where 2-5 patterns reinforce, conflict, or modulate each other, with multi-turn conversations expressing inner thoughts, actions, and dialogue. Our dual-level checklists evaluate both individual pattern fidelity and emergent multi-pattern dynamics, achieving strong human alignment (r=0.91) while revealing that holistic metrics conflate simulation accuracy with social desirability. HUMANLLM-8B outperforms Qwen3-32B on multi-pattern dynamics despite 4x fewer parameters, demonstrating that authentic anthropomorphism requires cognitive modeling--simulating not just what humans do, but the psychological processes generating those behaviors.

Motivation: To address the lack of a multilingual benchmark that evaluates persona-instruction compatibility for India's diverse linguistic needs.

Method: The authors introduce a benchmark spanning 12 languages with 4 tasks: monolingual and cross-lingual retrieval, reverse retrieval, and binary classification. Eight multilingual models were evaluated using a frozen encoder and logistic regression.

Result: E5-Large-Instruct achieved the highest Recall@1 for monolingual and cross-lingual scenarios, while BGE-M3 led reverse retrieval, and LaBSE showed the highest AUROC for classification.

Conclusion: The benchmark provides a practical guide for model selection in Indic multilingual retrieval and establishes a reproducible foundation for future research.

Abstract: Aligning multilingual assistants with culturally grounded user preferences is essential for serving India's linguistically diverse population of over one billion speakers across multiple scripts. However, existing benchmarks either focus on a single language or conflate retrieval with generation, leaving open the question of whether current embedding models can encode persona-instruction compatibility without relying on response synthesis. We present a unified benchmark spanning 12 Indian languages and four evaluation tasks: monolingual and cross-lingual persona-to-instruction retrieval, reverse retrieval from instruction to persona, and binary compatibility classification. Eight multilingual embedding models are evaluated in a frozen-encoder setting with a thin logistic regression head for classification. E5-Large-Instruct achieves the highest Recall@1 of 27.4\% on monolingual retrieval and 20.7\% on cross-lingual transfer, while BGE-M3 leads reverse retrieval at 32.1\% Recall@1. For classification, LaBSE attains 75.3\% AUROC with strong calibration. These findings offer practical guidance for model selection in Indic multilingual retrieval and establish reproducible baselines for future work\footnote{Code, datasets, and models are publicly available at https://github.com/aryashah2k/PI-Indic-Align.

### [105] [GeoSteer: Faithful Chain-of-Thought Steering via Latent Manifold Gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10229)
*Kentaro Kazama,Daiki Shirafuji,Tatsuhiko Saito*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'GeoSteer,' a framework to improve intermediate reasoning in large language models by using a manifold-based adjustment mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often produce logically inconsistent intermediate reasoning steps, even when they provide correct final answers, which undermines the reliability of their reasoning.

Method: GeoSteer involves constructing a dataset with scores for reasoning segments, training models (VAE and quality estimator) to learn a manifold of high-quality reasoning, and steering LLMs’ hidden states toward these areas in latent space.

Result: GeoSteer improved LLM performance on GSM8k, increasing exact match accuracy by 2.6 points and pairwise win rate by 5.3 points.

Conclusion: GeoSteer demonstrates a controlled and effective way to enhance intermediate reasoning quality in LLMs, benefiting answer correctness and reasoning coherence.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have improved multi-step reasoning. Most approaches rely on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales. Previous studies have shown that LLMs often generate logically inconsistent reasoning steps even when their final answers are correct. These inconsistencies reduce the reliability of step-level reasoning. We propose GeoSteer, a manifold-based framework that improves the quality of intermediate reasoning. The method consists of: (1) constructing a CoT dataset with segment-level scores, (2) training a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model and a quality estimation model to learn a low-dimensional manifold of high-quality CoT trajectories, and (3) steering hidden states of target LLMs toward higher-quality regions in the latent space. This update in a latent space behaves like a natural-gradient adjustment in the original hidden-state space. It ensures geometrically coherent steering. We evaluate GeoSteer on the GSM8k dataset using the Qwen3 series. We measure via answer accuracy and overall reasoning performance. GeoSteer improved the exact match accuracy by up to 2.6 points. It also enhanced the pairwise win rate by 5.3 points. These results indicate that GeoSteer provides an effective and controllable mechanism for improving the quality of intermediate reasoning in LLMs.

### [106] [Loop as a Bridge: Can Looped Transformers Truly Link Representation Space and Natural Language Outputs?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10242)
*Guanxu Chen,Dongrui Liu,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study assesses Looped Transformers (LTs) for their ability to bridge the gap between internal knowledge and linguistic outputs, revealing limitations in their introspection capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether Looped Transformers can effectively utilize iterative computation for introspection and improve the connection between internal representations and external outputs.

Method: Empirical experiments were conducted by varying loop iterations in Looped Transformers to observe changes in computational depth, representation degradation, and introspection capabilities.

Result: Increasing loop iterations narrowed the gap but led to degradation in internal knowledge representations. Introspection was observed only in final loop iterations rather than across loops.

Conclusion: Looped Transformers show potential for enhancing computational depth but lack the necessary introspection to fully connect internal representation spaces with linguistic outputs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit a gap between their internal knowledge and their explicit linguistic outputs. In this report, we empirically investigate whether Looped Transformers (LTs)--architectures that increase computational depth by iterating shared layers--can bridge this gap by utilizing their iterative nature as a form of introspection. Our experiments reveal that while increasing loop iterations narrows the gap, it is partly driven by a degradation of their internal knowledge carried by representations. Moreover, another empirical analysis suggests that current LTs' ability to perceive representations does not improve across loops; it is only present in the final loop. These results suggest that while LTs offer a promising direction for scaling computational depth, they have yet to achieve the introspection required to truly link representation space and natural language.

### [108] [Untangling Input Language from Reasoning Language: A Diagnostic Framework for Cross-Lingual Moral Alignment in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10257)
*Nan Li,Bo Kang,Tijl De Bie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how language affects moral judgments in LLMs, proposing a method to separate influences of input and reasoning languages, with findings highlighting discrepancies between languages and reasoning processes in moral decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand if LLMs arrive at different conclusions in moral dilemmas in different languages, exploring the interplay between language of input and reasoning.

Method: Introduced a methodology manipulating input and reasoning languages independently, including mismatched conditions, and used Moral Foundations Theory to analyze changes in moral judgments.

Result: Findings revealed that reasoning-language effects contribute more variance than input-language effects, identified missing context-dependency, and provided a diagnostic taxonomy for deployment guidance.

Conclusion: The methodology offers insights on language and moral judgment interactions in LLMs, aiding in better understanding and application of multilingual models in moral reasoning tasks.

Abstract: When LLMs judge moral dilemmas, do they reach different conclusions in different languages, and if so, why? Two factors could drive such differences: the language of the dilemma itself, or the language in which the model reasons. Standard evaluation conflates these by testing only matched conditions (e.g., English dilemma with English reasoning). We introduce a methodology that separately manipulates each factor, covering also mismatched conditions (e.g., English dilemma with Chinese reasoning), enabling decomposition of their contributions. To study \emph{what} changes, we propose an approach to interpret the moral judgments in terms of Moral Foundations Theory. As a side result, we identify evidence for splitting the Authority dimension into a family-related and an institutional dimension. Applying this methodology to English-Chinese moral judgment with 13 LLMs, we demonstrate its diagnostic power: (1) the framework isolates reasoning-language effects as contributing twice the variance of input-language effects; (2) it detects context-dependency in nearly half of models that standard evaluation misses; and (3) a diagnostic taxonomy translates these patterns into deployment guidance. We release our code and datasets at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CrossCulturalMoralJudgement.

*Hiroaki Yamagiwa,Yusuke Takase,Hidetoshi Shimodaira*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates relationships between attention heads in Transformers using a novel metric called the Projection Kernel (PK).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve understanding and interpretation of attention-head interactions within Transformer models, as existing metrics lack effectiveness in capturing these relationships.

Method: The authors introduce PK, a subspace similarity measure based on principal angles, and validate its effectiveness through experiments on the IOI task and a comparison framework.

Result: PK effectively captures known head-to-head interactions in the IOI task and reveals structural insights, such as L4H7 of GPT2-small acting as a hub identity head.

Conclusion: PK provides clearer insight into attention-head relationships in Transformers and is shown to be a valuable tool for structural analysis of attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Understanding relationships between attention heads is essential for interpreting the internal structure of Transformers, yet existing metrics do not capture this structure well. We focus on the subspaces spanned by attention-head weight matrices and quantify head-to-head relationships using the Projection Kernel (PK), a principal-angle-based measure of subspace similarity. Experiments show that PK reproduces known head-to-head interactions on the IOI task more clearly than prior metrics such as the Composition Score. We further introduce a framework to quantify the informativeness of PK distributions by comparing them with a reference distribution derived from random orthogonal subspaces. As an application, we analyze a directed graph constructed from PK and show that, in GPT2-small, L4H7 acts as a hub by functioning as an identity head.

*Yuxuan Lou,Kai Yang,Yang You*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MoST, an open-source multimodal large language model integrating speech and text, featuring a Modality-Aware Mixture of Experts (MAMoE) architecture for efficient multimodal processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal models often treat diverse modality representations with identical parameters, neglecting representational differences. The paper aims to address this gap by introducing a modality-aware system for better processing.

Method: The authors propose MAMoE architecture with modality-specific and shared experts. They employ an efficient pipeline that adapts pretrained models with ASR and TTS datasets and fine-tunes using speech-text instructions, relying only on open-source data.

Result: MoST outperforms other comparable models in ASR, TTS, audio language modeling, and spoken question answering benchmarks, with ablation studies showing the importance of the modality-specific routing and shared experts design.

Conclusion: MoST establishes itself as the first fully open-source speech-text large language model based on a Mixture of Experts architecture, showcasing strong performance and data efficiency.

Abstract: We present MoST (Mixture of Speech and Text), a novel multimodal large language model that seamlessly integrates speech and text processing through our proposed Modality-Aware Mixture of Experts (MAMoE) architecture. While current multimodal models typically process diverse modality representations with identical parameters, disregarding their inherent representational differences, we introduce specialized routing pathways that direct tokens to modality-appropriate experts based on input type. MAMoE simultaneously enhances modality-specific learning and cross-modal understanding through two complementary components: modality-specific expert groups that capture domain-specific patterns and shared experts that facilitate information transfer between modalities. Building on this architecture, we develop an efficient transformation pipeline that adapts the pretrained MoE language model through strategic post-training on ASR and TTS datasets, followed by fine-tuning with a carefully curated speech-text instruction dataset. A key feature of this pipeline is that it relies exclusively on fully accessible, open-source datasets to achieve strong performance and data efficiency. Comprehensive evaluations across ASR, TTS, audio language modeling, and spoken question answering benchmarks show that MoST consistently outperforms existing models of comparable parameter counts. Our ablation studies confirm that the modality-specific routing mechanism and shared experts design significantly contribute to performance gains across all tested domains. To our knowledge, MoST represents the first fully open-source speech-text LLM built on a Mixture of Experts architecture. \footnote{We release MoST model, training code, inference code, and training data at https://github.com/NUS-HPC-AI-Lab/MoST

TL;DR: The paper addresses moral alignment challenges in Large Language Models by improving intrinsic moral representations using Moral Foundations Theory, proposing a dynamic intervention method for safer AI performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing the intrinsic moral alignment of LLMs to address critical safety concerns in AI.

Method: Utilizing Moral Foundations Theory for probing, extracting moral vectors, and introducing Adaptive Moral Fusion for dynamic interventions.

Result: Validated shared moral representations across languages, improved LLM safety by reducing incorrect refusals and jailbreak success rates.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates effective manipulation of intrinsic moral subspaces, offering solutions for improving the ethical behavior of LLMs.

Abstract: Enhancing the moral alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a critical challenge in AI safety. Current alignment techniques often act as superficial guardrails, leaving the intrinsic moral representations of LLMs largely untouched. In this paper, we bridge this gap by leveraging Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) to map and manipulate the fine-grained moral landscape of LLMs. Through cross-lingual linear probing, we validate the shared nature of moral representations in middle layers and uncover a shared yet different moral subspace between English and Chinese. Building upon this, we extract steerable Moral Vectors and successfully validate their efficacy at both internal and behavioral levels. Leveraging the high generalizability of morality, we propose Adaptive Moral Fusion (AMF), a dynamic inference-time intervention that synergizes probe detection with vector injection to tackle the safety-helpfulness trade-off. Empirical results confirm that our approach acts as a targeted intrinsic defense, effectively reducing incorrect refusals on benign queries while minimizing jailbreak success rates compared to standard baselines.

TL;DR: SENSIA introduces a method for aligning sense-level mixtures and contextual representations across languages, which outperforms multilingual methods and uses less target-language data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in multilingual methods that depend heavily on shared parameters and scale, and explore alignment of latent meaning representations across languages.

Method: SENSIA adapts a language model using sense-level and contextual alignment on parallel data, while jointly training with a target-language modeling loss for fluency.

Result: SENSIA generally surpasses multilingual alignment methods on various benchmarks, uses less target-language data, and preserves sense geometry relative to English while being robust to design and scale changes.

Conclusion: SENSIA showcases an effective approach to multilingual modeling by focusing on sense-based interlingual alignment, achieving competitive results with efficiency and robustness.

Abstract: We approach multilinguality as sense adaptation: aligning latent meaning representations across languages rather than relying solely on shared parameters and scale. In this paper, we introduce SENse-based Symmetric Interlingual Alignment (SENSIA), which adapts a Backpack language model from one language to another by explicitly aligning sense-level mixtures and contextual representations on parallel data, while jointly training a target-language language modeling loss to preserve fluency. Across benchmarks on four typologically diverse languages, SENSIA generally outperforms comparable multilingual alignment methods and achieves competitive accuracy against monolingual from-scratch baselines while using 2-4x less target-language data. Analyses of learned sense geometry indicate that local sense topology and global structure relative to English are largely preserved, and ablations show that the method is robust in terms of design and scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in NL2SQL tasks, particularly in handling complex queries, ambiguity, and schema limitations.

Method: The approach includes Seed Mutation for synthesizing representative datasets, Knowledge-Grounded Reasoning Synthesis for interpretability, and a training methodology combining Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning.

Result: Experimental results showed BAR-SQL achieving a 91.48% accuracy on the Ent-SQL-Bench benchmark, surpassing models like Claude 4.5 Sonnet and GPT-5.

Conclusion: BAR-SQL improves SQL generation quality and handles ambiguous or unanswerable queries better than existing models, with source code and benchmark publicly available.

Abstract: In this paper, we present BAR-SQL (Boundary-Aware Reliable NL2SQL), a unified training framework that embeds reliability and boundary awareness directly into the generation process. We introduce a Seed Mutation data synthesis paradigm that constructs a representative enterprise corpus, explicitly encompassing multi-step analytical queries alongside boundary cases including ambiguity and schema limitations. To ensure interpretability, we employ Knowledge-Grounded Reasoning Synthesis, which produces Chain-of-Thought traces explicitly anchored in schema metadata and business rules. The model is trained through a two-stage process: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by Reinforcement Learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization. We design a Task-Conditioned Hybrid Reward mechanism that simultaneously optimizes SQL execution accuracy-leveraging Abstract Syntax Tree analysis and dense result matching-and semantic precision in abstention responses. To evaluate reliability alongside generation accuracy, we construct and release Ent-SQL-Bench, which jointly assesse SQL precision and boundary-aware abstention across ambiguous and unanswerable queries. Experimental results on this benchmark demonstrate that BAR-SQL achieves 91.48% average accuracy, outperforming leading proprietary models, including Claude 4.5 Sonnet and GPT-5, in both SQL generation quality and boundary-aware abstention capability.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a re-ranking model using late cross-attention to efficiently match resumes to job proposals, ensuring relevance and interpretability, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the difficulty of real-time matching of long, structured, and multilingual resumes to job proposals, and mitigate bias in historical data.

Method: The model uses a late cross-attention architecture for efficient handling of long-context inputs, combined with supervision from a generative LLM and an enriched distillation loss for enhanced learning.

Result: The proposed method enhances skill-fit scores and demonstrates superior performance across relevance, ranking, and calibration metrics compared to existing baselines.

Conclusion: This method improves person-job matching with better efficiency, interpretability, and accuracy in generating skill-fit scores.

Abstract: Finding the most relevant person for a job proposal in real time is challenging, especially when resumes are long, structured, and multilingual. In this paper, we propose a re-ranking model based on a new generation of late cross-attention architecture, that decomposes both resumes and project briefs to efficiently handle long-context inputs with minimal computational overhead. To mitigate historical data biases, we use a generative large language model (LLM) as a teacher, generating fine-grained, semantically grounded supervision. This signal is distilled into our student model via an enriched distillation loss function. The resulting model produces skill-fit scores that enable consistent and interpretable person-job matching. Experiments on relevance, ranking, and calibration metrics demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces OctoBench, a benchmarking tool to evaluate the capability of large language models (LLMs) in scaffold-specified, rule-compliant coding tasks, revealing gaps in their ability to follow heterogeneous instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs' instruction-following abilities in complex, persistent scaffold-constrained code-generating tasks remain underexplored, necessitating a benchmarking tool to address this gap.

Method: The study presents OctoBench encompassing 34 environments, 217 tasks, and 7,098 checklist items. It integrates an automated toolkit for tracking task progress and evaluating compliance with detailed rules.

Result: Experiments on eight model types reveal a discrepancy: models are adept at solving tasks but struggle with strict adherence to scaffold-defined instructions.

Conclusion: The introduced benchmark underscores the need for improved training of LLMs to handle heterogeneous instruction-following. OctoBench is released to aid reproducibility and innovation in scaffold-aware coding agent development.

Abstract: Modern coding scaffolds turn LLMs into capable software agents, but their ability to follow scaffold-specified instructions remains under-examined, especially when constraints are heterogeneous and persist across interactions. To fill this gap, we introduce OctoBench, which benchmarks scaffold-aware instruction following in repository-grounded agentic coding. OctoBench includes 34 environments and 217 tasks instantiated under three scaffold types, and is paired with 7,098 objective checklist items. To disentangle solving the task from following the rules, we provide an automated observation-and-scoring toolkit that captures full trajectories and performs fine-grained checks. Experiments on eight representative models reveal a systematic gap between task-solving and scaffold-aware compliance, underscoring the need for training and evaluation that explicitly targets heterogeneous instruction following. We release the benchmark to support reproducible benchmarking and to accelerate the development of more scaffold-aware coding agents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Training-Trajectory-Aware Token Selection (T3S) to optimize distillation efficiency for advanced reasoning models by specifically addressing token-level challenges in continual distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiencies in continued distillation of models with strong reasoning capabilities, aiming to improve performance without degradation.

Method: The researchers identified a problem where tokens bifurcate into Imitation-Anchor Tokens and suppressed tokens, then proposed T3S to refine training objectives at the token level.

Result: Through T3S, models achieved significant performance improvements. For example, Qwen3-8B outperformed DeepSeek-R1, and other models approached results from significantly larger counterparts.

Conclusion: T3S provides a clear optimization pathway for refining models effectively, resolving limitations in token-level bifurcation during distillation.

Abstract: Efficient distillation is a key pathway for converting expensive reasoning capability into deployable efficiency, yet in the frontier regime where the student already has strong reasoning ability, naive continual distillation often yields limited gains or even degradation. We observe a characteristic training phenomenon: even as loss decreases monotonically, all performance metrics can drop sharply at almost the same bottleneck, before gradually recovering. We further uncover a token-level mechanism: confidence bifurcates into steadily increasing Imitation-Anchor Tokens that quickly anchor optimization and other yet-to-learn tokens whose confidence is suppressed until after the bottleneck. And the characteristic that these two types of tokens cannot coexist is the root cause of the failure in continual distillation. To this end, we propose Training-Trajectory-Aware Token Selection (T3S) to reconstruct the training objective at the token level, clearing the optimization path for yet-to-learn tokens. T3 yields consistent gains in both AR and dLLM settings: with only hundreds of examples, Qwen3-8B surpasses DeepSeek-R1 on competitive reasoning benchmarks, Qwen3-32B approaches Qwen3-235B, and T3-trained LLaDA-2.0-Mini exceeds its AR baseline, achieving state-of-the-art performance among all of 16B-scale no-think models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GEM, a pipeline harnessing text corpora for multi-turn tool-use trajectory generation, enhancing Large Language Model (LLM) efficiency and generalization capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Building autonomous agents requires diversity and realism in multi-turn tool-use interactions, which currently lack sufficient quality data. The paper leverages textual corpora as scalable and authentic sources to address this challenge.

Method: The paper proposes GEM, a synthesis pipeline involving relevance filtering, workflow & tool extraction, trajectory grounding, and complexity refinement to extract multi-turn tool-use trajectories. A Trajectory Synthesizer model is trained to reduce computational costs while maintaining quality.

Result: GEM-32B improves performance by 16.5% on the BFCL V3 Multi-turn benchmark and demonstrates superior generalization capability compared to certain in-domain data models.

Conclusion: The method proves effective in generating high-quality tool-use data while reducing computational costs, showcasing the scalability and potential of textual corpora in improving LLMs for multi-turn interactions.

Abstract: Enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to effectively utilize tools in multi-turn interactions is essential for building capable autonomous agents. However, acquiring diverse and realistic multi-turn tool-use data remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a novel text-based paradigm. We observe that textual corpora naturally contain rich, multi-step problem-solving experiences, which can serve as an untapped, scalable, and authentic data source for multi-turn tool-use tasks. Based on this insight, we introduce GEM, a data synthesis pipeline that enables the generation and extraction of multi-turn tool-use trajectories from text corpora through a four-stage process: relevance filtering, workflow & tool extraction, trajectory grounding, and complexity refinement. To reduce the computational cost, we further train a specialized Trajectory Synthesizer via supervised fine-tuning. This model distills the complex generation pipeline into an efficient, end-to-end trajectory generator. Experiments demonstrate that our GEM-32B achieve a 16.5% improvement on the BFCL V3 Multi-turn benchmark. Our models partially surpass the performance of models trained on τ - bench (Airline and Retail) in-domain data, highlighting the superior generalization capability derived from our text-based synthesis paradigm. Notably, our Trajectory Synthesizer matches the quality of the full pipeline while significantly reducing inference latency and costs.

*Christina Lu,Jack Gallagher,Jonathan Michala,Kyle Fish,Jack Lindsey*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how large language models adopt personas, focusing on the "Assistant Axis," and shows how steering behavior can stabilize model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the structure of personas in language models and mitigate potential harmful or bizarre "persona drift."

Method: The authors analyze activation directions in language model architectures to identify and manipulate a key "Assistant Axis" linked to personas.

Result: The "Assistant Axis" can effectively stabilize model behavior, reduce persona drift, and counter adversarial jailbreak attempts.

Conclusion: Language model persona stability can be enhanced by strategies emphasizing deeper anchoring to the Assistant Axis, highlighting room for refined training and steering approaches.

Abstract: Large language models can represent a variety of personas but typically default to a helpful Assistant identity cultivated during post-training. We investigate the structure of the space of model personas by extracting activation directions corresponding to diverse character archetypes. Across several different models, we find that the leading component of this persona space is an "Assistant Axis," which captures the extent to which a model is operating in its default Assistant mode. Steering towards the Assistant direction reinforces helpful and harmless behavior; steering away increases the model's tendency to identify as other entities. Moreover, steering away with more extreme values often induces a mystical, theatrical speaking style. We find this axis is also present in pre-trained models, where it primarily promotes helpful human archetypes like consultants and coaches and inhibits spiritual ones. Measuring deviations along the Assistant Axis predicts "persona drift," a phenomenon where models slip into exhibiting harmful or bizarre behaviors that are uncharacteristic of their typical persona. We find that persona drift is often driven by conversations demanding meta-reflection on the model's processes or featuring emotionally vulnerable users. We show that restricting activations to a fixed region along the Assistant Axis can stabilize model behavior in these scenarios -- and also in the face of adversarial persona-based jailbreaks. Our results suggest that post-training steers models toward a particular region of persona space but only loosely tethers them to it, motivating work on training and steering strategies that more deeply anchor models to a coherent persona.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces INDIC-DIALECT, a 13k sentence-pair parallel corpus for 11 low-resource Indian dialects in Hindi and Odia, along with benchmark NLP tasks to improve dialect-aware Indic NLP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of representation and resources for low-resource dialects in Indian languages, which limits NLP advancements for Hindi and Odia dialects.

Method: The authors created INDIC-DIALECT, a human-curated parallel corpus, and developed a multi-task benchmark including dialect classification, multiple-choice question answering, and machine translation tasks.

Result: Experiments show GPT-4 and Gemini 2.5 perform poorly on classification tasks, while fine-tuning transformer-based models improved F1 scores from 19.6% to 89.8%. For machine translation, hybrid AI models and rule-based approaches achieve better BLEU scores compared to baselines.

Conclusion: INDIC-DIALECT serves as a valuable resource for advancing Indic NLP, aiming to improve representation and NLP performance for Indian low-resource dialects.

Abstract: Recent NLP advances focus primarily on standardized languages, leaving most low-resource dialects under-served especially in Indian scenarios. In India, the issue is particularly important: despite Hindi being the third most spoken language globally (over 600 million speakers), its numerous dialects remain underrepresented. The situation is similar for Odia, which has around 45 million speakers. While some datasets exist which contain standard Hindi and Odia languages, their regional dialects have almost no web presence. We introduce INDIC-DIALECT, a human-curated parallel corpus of 13k sentence pairs spanning 11 dialects and 2 languages: Hindi and Odia. Using this corpus, we construct a multi-task benchmark with three tasks: dialect classification, multiple-choice question (MCQ) answering, and machine translation (MT). Our experiments show that LLMs like GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 perform poorly on the classification task. While fine-tuned transformer based models pretrained on Indian languages substantially improve performance e.g., improving F1 from 19.6\% to 89.8\% on dialect classification. For dialect to language translation, we find that hybrid AI model achieves highest BLEU score of 61.32 compared to the baseline score of 23.36. Interestingly, due to complexity in generating dialect sentences, we observe that for language to dialect translation the ``rule-based followed by AI" approach achieves best BLEU score of 48.44 compared to the baseline score of 27.59. INDIC-DIALECT thus is a new benchmark for dialect-aware Indic NLP, and we plan to release it as open source to support further work on low-resource Indian dialects.

### [121] [TF3-RO-50M: Training Compact Romanian Language Models from Scratch on Synthetic Moral Microfiction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10410)
*Mihai Dan Nadas,Laura Diosan,Andreea Tomescu,Andrei Piscoran*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TF3-RO is a Romanian-centric language modeling pipeline addressing tokenizer design, model training, optimization, and synthetic dataset generation, tailored for morphologically rich languages like Romanian.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a comprehensive, reproducible framework for developing optimized language models and synthetic corpora for morphologically rich, under-resourced languages such as Romanian.

Method: The paper builds Romanian-specific tokenizers, trains a Transformer model from scratch, and refines it using compression techniques. It combines intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations and deploys a combinatorial prompting framework for synthetic data generation.

Result: A 26.45M-parameter compact Romanian model is developed, generating a synthetic dataset of three million Romanian-native fables while maintaining strong linguistic coherence and efficiency.

Conclusion: TF3-RO demonstrates an effective pipeline for compact language modeling and large-scale data generation in Romanian, setting a foundation for future research on resource-scarce languages.

Abstract: Recent advances in synthetic data generation have shown that compact language models can be trained effectively when the underlying corpus is structurally controlled and linguistically coherent. However, for morphologically rich and computationally under-resourced languages such as Romanian, there is still no openly documented, end-to-end pipeline that unifies tokenizer design, preprocessing, pretraining, compression, evaluation, and large-scale synthetic data generation in a reproducible framework. Building on TF1, a three-million-story English fable dataset, and TF2, which extends TF1 through high-quality Romanian translations, we introduce TF3-RO, a Romanian-centric language modeling pipeline spanning tokenizer training, from-scratch model development, and Romanian-native dataset generation. TF3-RO constructs Romanian-specific BPE and Unigram tokenizers from a linguistically informed corpus to mitigate token inflation induced by Romanian morphology. Using long-sequence packed training, we pretrain a 51.65M-parameter LLaMA-style Transformer entirely from scratch. The model is subsequently optimized through quantization, structured pruning, and logit-based knowledge distillation, yielding a compact 26.45M-parameter student model with tied embeddings and strong deployment characteristics. Using this distilled model, TF3-RO generates three million Romanian-native synthetic fables via a controlled combinatorial prompting framework. Across all stages, the pipeline integrates a comprehensive evaluation suite combining intrinsic metrics, Romanian agreement probes, entity coherence, rule-based grammar checking, and LLM-based assessment. TF3-RO provides a reproducible and linguistically grounded framework for training compact Romanian language models and producing large-scale synthetic narrative corpora.

### [122] [Are Language Models Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10421)
*Philip Resnik*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The authors argue against the claim that language models (LMs) are cognitive models, suggesting they are more suitable as tools, and highlight issues across Marr's three levels of analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to critically evaluate the assertion by Futrell and Mahowald that language models can serve as cognitive models.

Method: The authors assess language models across Marr's three levels of analysis: implementation, algorithmic-representational, and computational theory.

Result: Language models are deemed unsuitable as cognitive models at various levels, but are described as effective tools.

Conclusion: Language models should not be labeled as cognitive models, avoiding further hype surrounding their capabilities.

Abstract: Futrell and Mahowald claim LMs "serve as model systems", but an assessment at each of Marr's three levels suggests the claim is clearly not true at the implementation level, poorly motivated at the algorithmic-representational level, and problematic at the computational theory level. LMs are good candidates as tools; calling them cognitive models overstates the case and unnecessarily feeds LLM hype.

*Abhinaba Basu,Pavan Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Measured bias in models shifts substantially depending on contextual factors like time, location, and framing, without requiring adversarial prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand how contextual framing impacts bias in AI models to ensure evaluation robustness and prevent deployment oversights.

Method: Assessment of 13 models using a new benchmark, Contextual StereoSet, while systematically varying context, and proposing Context Sensitivity Fingerprints for robust bias evaluation.

Result: Context framing significantly affects stereotype manifestation; bias depends on conditions such as time, framing, and observer perspective.

Conclusion: Fixed-condition bias evaluation tests may not generalize, necessitating context-sensitive benchmarks like CSF for accurate diagnostics in AI models.

Abstract: A model that avoids stereotypes in a lab benchmark may not avoid them in deployment. We show that measured bias shifts dramatically when prompts mention different places, times, or audiences -- no adversarial prompting required.
  We introduce Contextual StereoSet, a benchmark that holds stereotype content fixed while systematically varying contextual framing. Testing 13 models across two protocols, we find striking patterns: anchoring to 1990 (vs. 2030) raises stereotype selection in all models tested on this contrast (p<0.05); gossip framing raises it in 5 of 6 full-grid models; out-group observer framing shifts it by up to 13 percentage points. These effects replicate in hiring, lending, and help-seeking vignettes.
  We propose Context Sensitivity Fingerprints (CSF): a compact profile of per-dimension dispersion and paired contrasts with bootstrap CIs and FDR correction. Two evaluation tracks support different use cases -- a 360-context diagnostic grid for deep analysis and a budgeted protocol covering 4,229 items for production screening.
  The implication is methodological: bias scores from fixed-condition tests may not generalize.This is not a claim about ground-truth bias rates; it is a stress test of evaluation robustness. CSF forces evaluators to ask, "Under what conditions does bias appear?" rather than "Is this model biased?" We release our benchmark, code, and results.

### [124] [DR-Arena: an Automated Evaluation Framework for Deep Research Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10504)
*Yiwen Gao,Ruochen Zhao,Yang Deng,Wenxuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DR-Arena is an automated evaluation framework for Large Language Models (LLMs), which uses real-time web trends and adaptive task complexity to push LLM capabilities to their boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation benchmarks for LLMs struggle with limitations such as static datasets, temporal misalignment, and data contamination, creating a need for dynamic and robust evaluation methods.

Method: DR-Arena employs Information Trees generated from fresh web trends along with an automated Examiner to create tasks testing deep reasoning and wide coverage capabilities. Additionally, tasks dynamically escalate in complexity through an Adaptive Evolvement Loop.

Result: DR-Arena demonstrated a Spearman correlation of 0.94 with a leading leaderboard, achieving strong alignment with human preferences in evaluation without manual intervention.

Conclusion: DR-Arena is a reliable and automated alternative for LLM evaluation, eliminating the need for costly human adjudication while ensuring real-time task relevance and robust capability testing.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly operate as Deep Research (DR) Agents capable of autonomous investigation and information synthesis, reliable evaluation of their task performance has become a critical bottleneck. Current benchmarks predominantly rely on static datasets, which suffer from several limitations: limited task generality, temporal misalignment, and data contamination. To address these, we introduce DR-Arena, a fully automated evaluation framework that pushes DR agents to their capability limits through dynamic investigation. DR-Arena constructs real-time Information Trees from fresh web trends to ensure the evaluation rubric is synchronized with the live world state, and employs an automated Examiner to generate structured tasks testing two orthogonal capabilities: Deep reasoning and Wide coverage. DR-Arena further adopts Adaptive Evolvement Loop, a state-machine controller that dynamically escalates task complexity based on real-time performance, demanding deeper deduction or wider aggregation until a decisive capability boundary emerges. Experiments with six advanced DR agents demonstrate that DR-Arena achieves a Spearman correlation of 0.94 with the LMSYS Search Arena leaderboard. This represents the state-of-the-art alignment with human preferences without any manual efforts, validating DR-Arena as a reliable alternative for costly human adjudication.

### [125] [AEQ-Bench: Measuring Empathy of Omni-Modal Large Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10513)
*Xuan Luo,Lewei Yao,Libo Zhao,Lanqing Hong,Kai Chen,Dehua Tao,Daxin Tan,Ruifeng Xu,Jing Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces AEQ-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating omni-modal models in empathetic abilities through multi-modal inputs and judgments of audio response empathy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the significant challenge of empathetic assessment in omni-modal models, particularly how they process emotional and multi-modal affective cues.

Method: AEQ-Bench systematically evaluates two empathetic capabilities of omni-modal models: generating empathetic responses using multi-modal stimuli and judging empathy from audio outputs.

Result: OLMs with audio-capable outputs perform better than text-only ones, but these models are limited in fine-grained paralinguistic evaluations, aligning better with human judgment on a coarse level.

Conclusion: AEQ-Bench offers valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of omni-modal models' empathetic capabilities, highlighting challenges in fine-grained empathy assessment.

Abstract: While the automatic evaluation of omni-modal large models (OLMs) is essential, assessing empathy remains a significant challenge due to its inherent affectivity. To investigate this challenge, we introduce AEQ-Bench (Audio Empathy Quotient Benchmark), a novel benchmark to systematically assess two core empathetic capabilities of OLMs: (i) generating empathetic responses by comprehending affective cues from multi-modal inputs (audio + text), and (ii) judging the empathy of audio responses without relying on text transcription. Compared to existing benchmarks, AEQ-Bench incorporates two novel settings that vary in context specificity and speech tone. Comprehensive assessment across linguistic and paralinguistic metrics reveals that (1) OLMs trained with audio output capabilities generally outperformed models with text-only outputs, and (2) while OLMs align with human judgments for coarse-grained quality assessment, they remain unreliable for evaluating fine-grained paralinguistic expressiveness.

### [126] [PERM: Psychology-grounded Empathetic Reward Modeling for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10532)
*Chengbing Wang,Wuqiang Zheng,Yang Zhang,Fengbin Zhu,Junyi Cheng,Yi Xie,Wenjie Wang,Fuli Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study introduces PERM, a novel reward model for improving Large Language Models' empathy, offering a superior bidirectional evaluation framework grounded in Empathy Cycle theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often fall short in delivering substantive emotional support. Traditional reward models assess empathy unidirectionally, neglecting the interactive nature of human empathy.

Method: PERM evaluates empathy through three perspectives: supporter (internal and communicative aspects), seeker (emotional reception), and a bystander assessment of interaction quality.

Result: PERM achieves over 10% improvement on benchmarks and a blinded user study shows 70% preference for its empathetic responses.

Conclusion: PERM substantially enhances LLMs’ empathetic response capabilities, outperforming existing methods, and is backed by accessible code, datasets, and models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in human-centric applications, yet they often fail to provide substantive emotional support. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been utilized to enhance empathy of LLMs, existing reward models typically evaluate empathy from a single perspective, overlooking the inherently bidirectional interaction nature of empathy between the supporter and seeker as defined by Empathy Cycle theory. To address this limitation, we propose Psychology-grounded Empathetic Reward Modeling (PERM). PERM operationalizes empathy evaluation through a bidirectional decomposition: 1) Supporter perspective, assessing internal resonation and communicative expression; 2) Seeker perspective, evaluating emotional reception. Additionally, it incorporates a bystander perspective to monitor overall interaction quality. Extensive experiments on a widely-used emotional intelligence benchmark and an industrial daily conversation dataset demonstrate that PERM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by over 10\%. Furthermore, a blinded user study reveals a 70\% preference for our approach, highlighting its efficacy in generating more empathetic responses. Our code, dataset, and models are available at https://github.com/ZhengWwwq/PERM.

### [127] [Representation-Aware Unlearning via Activation Signatures: From Suppression to Knowledge-Signature Erasure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10566)
*Syed Naveed Mahmood,Md. Rezaur Rahman Bhuiyan,Tasfia Zaman,Jareen Tasneem Khondaker,Md. Sameer Sakib,Nazia Tasnim,Farig Sadeque*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Knowledge Immunization Framework (KIF) for selective and durable knowledge erasure in Large Language Models (LLMs), achieving near-complete erasure while preserving model utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper is to address the challenges of genuinely erasing specific knowledge from LLMs for reasons such as GDPR compliance and ensuring model safety, as current methods fail to fully eliminate latent knowledge.

Method: The authors propose the Knowledge Immunization Framework (KIF), a representation-aware architecture that targets internal activation signatures for erasure, using dynamic suppression and parameter-efficient adaptation to prevent the need for full model retraining.

Result: KIF achieves near-oracle erasure (FQ = 0.99) while maintaining utility levels (MU = 0.62). It performs effectively across standard and reasoning-prior models, shows scale-independent erasure in standard models, and highlights architectural divergences in reasoning-prior models.

Conclusion: KIF overcomes the stability-erasure tradeoff present in prior work by enabling systematic and durable knowledge erasure, operationalizing a distinction between obfuscation and true erasure, and advancing understanding of forgetting mechanisms in LLMs.

Abstract: Selective knowledge erasure from LLMs is critical for GDPR compliance and model safety, yet current unlearning methods conflate behavioral suppression with true knowledge removal, allowing latent capabilities to persist beneath surface-level refusals. In this work, we address this challenge by introducing Knowledge Immunization Framework (KIF), a representation-aware architecture that distinguishes genuine erasure from obfuscation by targeting internal activation signatures rather than surface outputs. Our approach combines dynamic suppression of subject-specific representations with parameter-efficient adaptation, enabling durable unlearning without full model retraining. KIF achieves near-oracle erasure (FQ approx 0.99 vs. 1.00) while preserving utility at oracle levels (MU = 0.62), effectively breaking the stability-erasure tradeoff that has constrained all prior work. We evaluate both standard foundation models (Llama and Mistral) and reasoning-prior models (Qwen and DeepSeek) across 3B to 14B parameters. Our observation shows that standard models exhibit scale-independent true erasure (<3% utility drift), while reasoning-prior models reveal fundamental architectural divergence. Our comprehensive dual-metric evaluation protocol, combining surface-level leakage with latent trace persistence, operationalizes the obfuscation - erasure distinction and enables the first systematic diagnosis of mechanism-level forgetting behavior across model families and scales.

*Wessel Poelman,Miryam de Lhoneux*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper highlights limitations of intrinsic metrics like perplexity in evaluating conditional language models (CLMs) in multilingual setups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Researchers aim to understand and clarify assumptions behind intrinsic evaluation metrics in assessing CLMs, especially in multilingual contexts.

Method: Experiments are conducted on two multi-parallel corpora using six metrics and both mono- and multilingual models.

Result: Findings reveal that existing metrics are not universally comparable, challenging common assumptions about their reliability in multilingual scenarios.

Conclusion: Metrics like perplexity are problematically assumed to represent quality uniformly across languages; the form-meaning debate sheds light on these comparability issues.

Abstract: Intrinsic evaluation metrics for conditional language models, such as perplexity or bits-per-character, are widely used in both mono- and multilingual settings. These metrics are rather straightforward to use and compare in monolingual setups, but rest on a number of assumptions in multilingual setups. One such assumption is that comparing the perplexity of CLMs on parallel sentences is indicative of their quality since the information content (here understood as the semantic meaning) is the same. However, the metrics are inherently measuring information content in the information-theoretic sense. We make this and other such assumptions explicit and discuss their implications. We perform experiments with six metrics on two multi-parallel corpora both with mono- and multilingual models. Ultimately, we find that current metrics are not universally comparable. We look at the form-meaning debate to provide some explanation for this.

### [129] [Influential Training Data Retrieval for Explaining Verbalized Confidence of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10645)
*Yuxi Xia,Loris Schoenegger,Benjamin Roth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the factors influencing verbalized confidence in large language models (LLMs), unveiling they often express confidence superficially rather than factually, and proposes methods for improving reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and enhancing LLMs' ability to express reliable confidence is crucial for increasing user trust, especially since current models often verbalize confidence that deviates from factual accuracy.

Method: The paper introduces TracVC, leveraging information retrieval and influence estimation to trace confidence expressions to their training data, and measures content groundness to assess the connection between LLM confidence and training data relevance.

Result: Findings show OLMo2-13B often mirrors linguistic expressions of confidence superficially, disconnected from content relevance, highlighting a limitation in how current LLMs are trained.

Conclusion: Current LLM training approaches enable models to sound confident but fail to ensure that confidence aligns with factual grounding, underscoring the need for improved methods focused on genuine content-oriented confidence expression.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can increase users' perceived trust by verbalizing confidence in their outputs. However, prior work has shown that LLMs are often overconfident, making their stated confidence unreliable since it does not consistently align with factual accuracy. To better understand the sources of this verbalized confidence, we introduce TracVC (\textbf{Trac}ing \textbf{V}erbalized \textbf{C}onfidence), a method that builds on information retrieval and influence estimation to trace generated confidence expressions back to the training data. We evaluate TracVC on OLMo and Llama models in a question answering setting, proposing a new metric, content groundness, which measures the extent to which an LLM grounds its confidence in content-related training examples (relevant to the question and answer) versus in generic examples of confidence verbalization. Our analysis reveals that OLMo2-13B is frequently influenced by confidence-related data that is lexically unrelated to the query, suggesting that it may mimic superficial linguistic expressions of certainty rather than rely on genuine content grounding. These findings point to a fundamental limitation in current training regimes: LLMs may learn how to sound confident without learning when confidence is justified. Our analysis provides a foundation for improving LLMs' trustworthiness in expressing more reliable confidence.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores detecting persuasion in arguments using persuasion strategies and large language models, presenting a topic-annotated dataset to advance research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand the role of persuasion strategies in influencing argumentative text's persuasiveness.

Method: Employing large language models with strategy-guided reasoning over six specific persuasion strategies across annotated datasets.

Result: Strategy-guided reasoning enhances the prediction of persuasiveness and provides better interpretability and robustness.

Conclusion: Structured, strategy-aware approaches improve argument quality assessment and foster future research in persuasion analysis.

Abstract: Detecting persuasion in argumentative text is a challenging task with important implications for understanding human communication. This work investigates the role of persuasion strategies - such as Attack on reputation, Distraction, and Manipulative wording - in determining the persuasiveness of a text. We conduct experiments on three annotated argument datasets: Winning Arguments (built from the Change My View subreddit), Anthropic/Persuasion, and Persuasion for Good. Our approach leverages large language models (LLMs) with a Multi-Strategy Persuasion Scoring approach that guides reasoning over six persuasion strategies. Results show that strategy-guided reasoning improves the prediction of persuasiveness. To better understand the influence of content, we organize the Winning Argument dataset into broad discussion topics and analyze performance across them. We publicly release this topic-annotated version of the dataset to facilitate future research. Overall, our methodology demonstrates the value of structured, strategy-aware prompting for enhancing interpretability and robustness in argument quality assessment.

*Gilat Toker,Nitay Calderon,Ohad Amosy,Roi Reichart*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LIBERTy, a framework with datasets and metrics for systematic evaluation of concept-based explanations and model sensitivity using structural counterfactual pairs generated through defined causal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for evaluating concept-based explanations are costly and rely on imperfect human-written counterfactuals. A more systematic and scalable approach is needed.

Method: LIBERTy uses Structured Causal Models to define interventions, propagating changes through the models until a LLM generates counterfactuals. It includes three datasets and a metric, order-faithfulness, for evaluation.

Result: LIBERTy evaluates multiple methods across five models, revealing headroom for improvement and reduced demographic sensitivity in proprietary LLMs due to mitigation measures.

Conclusion: LIBERTy offers a standardized benchmark, enabling advancements in faithful explainability methods in high-stakes domains.

Abstract: Concept-based explanations quantify how high-level concepts (e.g., gender or experience) influence model behavior, which is crucial for decision-makers in high-stakes domains. Recent work evaluates the faithfulness of such explanations by comparing them to reference causal effects estimated from counterfactuals. In practice, existing benchmarks rely on costly human-written counterfactuals that serve as an imperfect proxy. To address this, we introduce a framework for constructing datasets containing structural counterfactual pairs: LIBERTy (LLM-based Interventional Benchmark for Explainability with Reference Targets). LIBERTy is grounded in explicitly defined Structured Causal Models (SCMs) of the text generation, interventions on a concept propagate through the SCM until an LLM generates the counterfactual. We introduce three datasets (disease detection, CV screening, and workplace violence prediction) together with a new evaluation metric, order-faithfulness. Using them, we evaluate a wide range of methods across five models and identify substantial headroom for improving concept-based explanations. LIBERTy also enables systematic analysis of model sensitivity to interventions: we find that proprietary LLMs show markedly reduced sensitivity to demographic concepts, likely due to post-training mitigation. Overall, LIBERTy provides a much-needed benchmark for developing faithful explainability methods.

*Ruozhen Yang,Yucheng Jiang,Yueqi Jiang,Priyanka Kargupta,Yunyi Zhang,Jiawei Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents STITCH, a memory system for large language models focused on effective retrieval during goal-oriented tasks by utilizing structured intent tracking. It shows significant performance improvements in evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The difficulty in deploying large language models for long-horizon, goal-oriented interactions stems from issues like context-mismatched memory retrieval due to recurring entities and facts under different goals and constraints.

Method: The authors propose STITCH, an agentic memory system that indexes trajectory steps using structured retrieval cues (contextual intents). This indexing includes current latent goals, action types, and salient entity types. STITCH prioritizes memory retrieval through intent compatibility filters and introduces CAME-Bench for evaluation.

Result: STITCH achieves state-of-the-art performance on CAME-Bench and LongMemEval benchmarks, outperforming the strongest baseline by 35.6%. It demonstrates significant improvements, especially as the length of trajectories increases.

Conclusion: Intent-aware indexing and retrieval in memory systems like STITCH enable large language models to more effectively handle long-horizon, goal-oriented interactions, reducing noise and improving reasoning accuracy.

Abstract: Deploying large language models in long-horizon, goal-oriented interactions remains challenging because similar entities and facts recur under different latent goals and constraints, causing memory systems to retrieve context-mismatched evidence. We propose STITCH (Structured Intent Tracking in Contextual History), an agentic memory system that indexes each trajectory step with a structured retrieval cue, contextual intent, and retrieves history by matching the current step's intent. Contextual intent provides compact signals that disambiguate repeated mentions and reduce interference: (1) the current latent goal defining a thematic segment, (2) the action type, and (3) the salient entity types anchoring which attributes matter. During inference, STITCH filters and prioritizes memory snippets by intent compatibility, suppressing semantically similar but context-incompatible history.
  For evaluation, we introduce CAME-Bench, a benchmark for context-aware retrieval in realistic, dynamic, goal-oriented trajectories. Across CAME-Bench and LongMemEval, STITCH achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the strongest baseline by 35.6%, with the largest gains as trajectory length increases. Our analysis shows that intent indexing substantially reduces retrieval noise, supporting intent-aware memory for robust long-horizon reasoning.

*Changle Qu,Sunhao Dai,Hengyi Cai,Jun Xu,Shuaiqiang Wang,Dawei Yin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents MatchTIR, a framework that improves LLMs' reasoning with fine-grained supervision and dual-level advantage estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in coarse-grained credit assignment during tool interactions by LLMs, which fails to effectively differentiate useful tool calls from redundant or erroneous ones in complex scenarios.

Method: MatchTIR uses bipartite matching to assign fine-grained turn-level rewards and employs dual-level advantage estimation for balancing local precision with global success.

Result: MatchTIR outperformed competitors on three benchmarks, with the 4B model surpassing most 8B models, especially in long-horizon and multi-turn tasks.

Conclusion: MatchTIR offers a significant advancement in tool-integrated reasoning for LLMs by providing precise credit assignment and advantage estimation, improving efficiency and task success rates.

Abstract: Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) empowers large language models (LLMs) to tackle complex tasks by interleaving reasoning steps with external tool interactions. However, existing reinforcement learning methods typically rely on outcome- or trajectory-level rewards, assigning uniform advantages to all steps within a trajectory. This coarse-grained credit assignment fails to distinguish effective tool calls from redundant or erroneous ones, particularly in long-horizon multi-turn scenarios. To address this, we propose MatchTIR, a framework that introduces fine-grained supervision via bipartite matching-based turn-level reward assignment and dual-level advantage estimation. Specifically, we formulate credit assignment as a bipartite matching problem between predicted and ground-truth traces, utilizing two assignment strategies to derive dense turn-level rewards. Furthermore, to balance local step precision with global task success, we introduce a dual-level advantage estimation scheme that integrates turn-level and trajectory-level signals, assigning distinct advantage values to individual interaction turns. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of MatchTIR. Notably, our 4B model surpasses the majority of 8B competitors, particularly in long-horizon and multi-turn tasks. Our codes are available at https://github.com/quchangle1/MatchTIR.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a pipeline for creating and analyzing adversarial patches targeting facial biometric systems, employing methods like FGSM, diffusion models, and Vision Transformer for classification and captioning evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore adversarial patches' ability to compromise facial biometric systems, providing insights for forensic analysis and enhancing security testing.

Method: The method involves generating adversarial noise using FGSM, refining patches via reverse diffusion, Gaussian smoothing, and adaptive adjustments, and applying Vision Transformer models for evaluation.

Result: The study achieves SSIM of 0.95, indicating high fidelity for detection and analysis of adversarial patches, and examines vulnerabilities in identity verification under adversarial conditions.

Conclusion: The paper concludes the effectiveness of the pipeline in generating and evaluating adversarial patches, supporting security enhancements and forensic applications.

Abstract: This work presents an end-to-end pipeline for generating, refining, and evaluating adversarial patches to compromise facial biometric systems, with applications in forensic analysis and security testing. We utilize FGSM to generate adversarial noise targeting an identity classifier and employ a diffusion model with reverse diffusion to enhance imperceptibility through Gaussian smoothing and adaptive brightness correction, thereby facilitating synthetic adversarial patch evasion. The refined patch is applied to facial images to test its ability to evade recognition systems while maintaining natural visual characteristics. A Vision Transformer (ViT)-GPT2 model generates captions to provide a semantic description of a person's identity for adversarial images, supporting forensic interpretation and documentation for identity evasion and recognition attacks. The pipeline evaluates changes in identity classification, captioning results, and vulnerabilities in facial identity verification and expression recognition under adversarial conditions. We further demonstrate effective detection and analysis of adversarial patches and adversarial samples using perceptual hashing and segmentation, achieving an SSIM of 0.95.

*Carlo Sgaravatti,Riccardo Pieroni,Matteo Corno,Sergio M. Savaresi,Luca Magri,Giacomo Boracchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LCF3D, a sensor fusion framework that improves 3D object detection for autonomous driving by combining RGB images and LiDAR data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in integrating RGB camera and LiDAR sensor data effectively for accurate 3D object localization in autonomous vehicles.

Method: LCF3D employs late fusion to reduce LiDAR false positives and cascade fusion to recover missed objects by matching RGB 2D detections with LiDAR 3D detections.

Result: LCF3D enhances detection performance, especially for difficult classes like pedestrians and cyclists, and shows robustness in domain generalization with different sensor configurations.

Conclusion: LCF3D improves accuracy in 3D object detection, demonstrating its effectiveness in both challenging scenarios and diverse domain setups.

Abstract: Accurately localizing 3D objects like pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles is essential in Autonomous Driving. To ensure high detection performance, Autonomous Vehicles complement RGB cameras with LiDAR sensors, but effectively combining these data sources for 3D object detection remains challenging. We propose LCF3D, a novel sensor fusion framework that combines a 2D object detector on RGB images with a 3D object detector on LiDAR point clouds. By leveraging multimodal fusion principles, we compensate for inaccuracies in the LiDAR object detection network. Our solution combines two key principles: (i) late fusion, to reduce LiDAR False Positives by matching LiDAR 3D detections with RGB 2D detections and filtering out unmatched LiDAR detections; and (ii) cascade fusion, to recover missed objects from LiDAR by generating new 3D frustum proposals corresponding to unmatched RGB detections.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NanoSD introduces a lightweight generative model derived from Stable Diffusion 1.5, optimized for real-time performance on edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing latent diffusion models are powerful but computationally demanding, making them unsuitable for edge devices.

Method: The paper proposes NanoSD, which distills Stable Diffusion 1.5 using techniques like network surgery and feature-wise generative distillation, coupled with co-designed architectural scaling of the U-Net and VAE.

Result: NanoSD produces multiple efficient models ranging from 130M-315M parameters, achieving real-time inference (as low as 20ms) on mobile-class NPUs while excelling at image restoration and other visual tasks.

Conclusion: NanoSD is a versatile and efficient diffusion model family suitable for state-of-the-art outcomes in real-time visual tasks on edge devices, surpassing prior lightweight methods.

Abstract: Latent diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion 1.5 offer strong generative priors that are highly valuable for image restoration, yet their full pipelines remain too computationally heavy for deployment on edge devices. Existing lightweight variants predominantly compress the denoising U-Net or reduce the diffusion trajectory, which disrupts the underlying latent manifold and limits generalization beyond a single task. We introduce NanoSD, a family of Pareto-optimal diffusion foundation models distilled from Stable Diffusion 1.5 through network surgery, feature-wise generative distillation, and structured architectural scaling jointly applied to the U-Net and the VAE encoder-decoder. This full-pipeline co-design preserves the generative prior while producing models that occupy distinct operating points along the accuracy-latency-size frontier (e.g., 130M-315M parameters, achieving real-time inference down to 20ms on mobile-class NPUs). We show that parameter reduction alone does not correlate with hardware efficiency, and we provide an analysis revealing how architectural balance, feature routing, and latent-space preservation jointly shape true on-device latency. When used as a drop-in backbone, NanoSD enables state-of-the-art performance across image super-resolution, image deblurring, face restoration, and monocular depth estimation, outperforming prior lightweight diffusion models in both perceptual quality and practical deployability. NanoSD establishes a general-purpose diffusion foundation model family suitable for real-time visual generation and restoration on edge devices.

### [138] [UniHash: Unifying Pointwise and Pairwise Hashing Paradigms for Seen and Unseen Category Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09828)
*Xiaoxu Ma,Runhao Li,Hanwen Liu,Xiangbo Zhang,Zhenyu Weng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniHash is a novel hashing framework integrating pointwise and pairwise paradigms for effective image retrieval across seen and unseen categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image retrieval systems face challenges in balancing performance between seen and unseen categories, as existing paradigms excel mostly on either one.

Method: UniHash employs a dual-branch framework with mutual learning loss and the SM-MoH module to facilitate bidirectional knowledge transfer and enhance hash code learning.

Result: Theoretical analysis and experiments on datasets like CIFAR-10, MSCOCO, and ImageNet show UniHash achieves state-of-the-art performance in both retrieval scenarios.

Conclusion: UniHash successfully balances retrieval efficiency across seen and unseen classes by combining the strengths of two paradigms via innovative methods, demonstrated by extensive experimental validation.

Abstract: Effective retrieval across both seen and unseen categories is crucial for modern image retrieval systems. Retrieval on seen categories ensures precise recognition of known classes, while retrieval on unseen categories promotes generalization to novel classes with limited supervision. However, most existing deep hashing methods are confined to a single training paradigm, either pointwise or pairwise, where the former excels on seen categories and the latter generalizes better to unseen ones. To overcome this limitation, we propose Unified Hashing (UniHash), a dual-branch framework that unifies the strengths of both paradigms to achieve balanced retrieval performance across seen and unseen categories. UniHash consists of two complementary branches: a center-based branch following the pointwise paradigm and a pairwise branch following the pairwise paradigm. A novel hash code learning method is introduced to enable bidirectional knowledge transfer between branches, improving hash code discriminability and generalization. It employs a mutual learning loss to align hash representations and introduces a Split-Merge Mixture of Hash Experts (SM-MoH) module to enhance cross-branch exchange of hash representations. Theoretical analysis substantiates the effectiveness of UniHash, and extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, MSCOCO, and ImageNet demonstrate that UniHash consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both seen and unseen image retrieval scenarios.

*Po-han Li,Shenghui Chen,Ufuk Topcu,Sandeep Chinchali*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ViSIL, a metric to evaluate multimodal video captions by measuring information loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current metrics fail to adequately evaluate multimodal summaries due to their inability to compare varied formats effectively.

Method: The authors propose ViSIL, an information-theoretic framework leveraging vision-language model (VLM) inference to quantify video information loss.

Result: ViSIL scores correlate significantly with human and VLM performance in Video Question Answering (VQA), improving summary selection and VQA accuracy by 7%.

Conclusion: ViSIL provides a unified metric improving multimodal summary evaluation and selection, balancing information retention and processing speed.

Abstract: Multimodal video captioning condenses dense footage into a structured format of keyframes and natural language. By creating a cohesive multimodal summary, this approach anchors generative AI in rich semantic evidence and serves as a lightweight proxy for high-efficiency retrieval. However, traditional metrics like BLEU or ROUGE fail to quantify information coverage across disparate modalities, such as comparing a paragraph of text to a sequence of keyframes. To address this, we propose the Video Summary Information Loss (ViSIL) score, an information-theoretic framework that quantifies the video information not captured by a summary via vision-language model (VLM) inference. By measuring the information loss, ViSIL is a unified metric that enables direct comparison across multimodal summary formats despite their structural discrepancies. Our results demonstrate that ViSIL scores show a statistically significant correlation with both human and VLM performance on Video Question Answering (VQA) tasks. ViSIL also enables summary selection to optimize the trade-off between information loss and processing speed, establishing a Pareto-optimal frontier that outperforms text summaries by $7\%$ in VQA accuracy without increasing processing load.

*Anant Mehta,Xiyuan Wei,Xingyu Chen,Tianbao Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TuneCLIP introduces a self-supervised fine-tuning framework that overcomes performance degradation issues in pretrained CLIP models, improving general task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of enhancing open-weight CLIP models using existing self-supervised datasets, without starting training from scratch.

Method: TuneCLIP incorporates a warm-up stage to recover optimization statistics and a fine-tuning stage using a new contrastive loss to address false negative pair penalization.

Result: TuneCLIP improves the performance of open-weight CLIP models such as SigLIP (ViT-B/16), achieving up to +2.5% gains on benchmarks like ImageNet and +1.2% on DataComp.

Conclusion: TuneCLIP offers an efficient solution for post-pretraining adaptation in multimodal representation learning, setting a strong baseline for further improvements.

Abstract: CLIP has become a cornerstone of multimodal representation learning, yet improving its performance typically requires a prohibitively costly process of training from scratch on billions of samples. We ask a different question: Can we improve the performance of open-weight CLIP models across various downstream tasks using only existing self-supervised datasets? Unlike supervised fine-tuning, which adapts a pretrained model to a single downstream task, our setting seeks to improve general performance across various tasks. However, as both our experiments and prior studies reveal, simply applying standard training protocols starting from an open-weight CLIP model often fails, leading to performance degradation. In this paper, we introduce TuneCLIP, a self-supervised fine-tuning framework that overcomes the performance degradation. TuneCLIP has two key components: (1) a warm-up stage of recovering optimization statistics to reduce cold-start bias, inspired by theoretical analysis, and (2) a fine-tuning stage of optimizing a new contrastive loss to mitigate the penalization on false negative pairs. Our extensive experiments show that TuneCLIP consistently improves performance across model architectures and scales. Notably, it elevates leading open-weight models like SigLIP (ViT-B/16), achieving gains of up to +2.5% on ImageNet and related out-of-distribution benchmarks, and +1.2% on the highly competitive DataComp benchmark, setting a new strong baseline for efficient post-pretraining adaptation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces VibrantSR, a generative super-resolution framework that estimates high-resolution canopy heights (0.5m CHMs) from 10m Sentinel-2 imagery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable consistent, large-scale forest monitoring and carbon accounting by overcoming aerial imagery's temporal and cost limitations while maintaining accuracy for canopy height estimation.

Method: VibrantSR utilizes globally accessible Sentinel-2 seasonal composite imagery to estimate canopy heights. It was validated using disjoint splits across diverse eco-regions in the western US.

Result: VibrantSR achieves a mean absolute error of 4.39m for canopy heights >= 2m, surpassing multiple satellite-based benchmarks in accuracy while being less accurate than aerial-based methods.

Conclusion: VibrantSR provides a scalable, cost-effective approach to high-resolution forest monitoring across large areas, enabling improved operational use without reliance on expensive, infrequent aerial datasets.

Abstract: We present VibrantSR (Vibrant Super-Resolution), a generative super-resolution framework for estimating 0.5 meter canopy height models (CHMs) from 10 meter Sentinel-2 imagery. Unlike approaches based on aerial imagery that are constrained by infrequent and irregular acquisition schedules, VibrantSR leverages globally available Sentinel-2 seasonal composites, enabling consistent monitoring at a seasonal-to-annual cadence. Evaluated across 22 EPA Level 3 eco-regions in the western United States using spatially disjoint validation splits, VibrantSR achieves a Mean Absolute Error of 4.39 meters for canopy heights >= 2 m, outperforming Meta (4.83 m), LANDFIRE (5.96 m), and ETH (7.05 m) satellite-based benchmarks. While aerial-based VibrantVS (2.71 m MAE) retains an accuracy advantage, VibrantSR enables operational forest monitoring and carbon accounting at continental scales without reliance on costly and temporally infrequent aerial acquisitions.

TL;DR: This paper introduces MedVL-SAM2, a unified 3D medical multimodal model designed for combining report generation, VQA, and multi-paradigm segmentation into one framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for a 3D medical vision-language model that can achieve fine-grained visual grounding and volumetric spatial reasoning, as existing models mainly focus on image-level tasks only.

Method: MedVL-SAM2 integrates image-level and pixel-level reasoning through a unified architecture and incorporates a SAM2-based segmentation module for precise spatial reasoning. It uses a multi-stage training process combining pretraining on 3D CT image-text pairs and joint optimization with language and segmentation tasks.

Result: MedVL-SAM2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in report generation, VQA, and 3D segmentation tasks, while supporting interactive segmentation and robust cross-modal reasoning.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the feasibility of unifying high-level semantic reasoning with precise 3D localization in a single framework for medical imaging applications.

Abstract: Recent progress in medical vision-language models (VLMs) has achieved strong performance on image-level text-centric tasks such as report generation and visual question answering (VQA). However, achieving fine-grained visual grounding and volumetric spatial reasoning in 3D medical VLMs remains challenging, particularly when aiming to unify these capabilities within a single, generalizable framework. To address this challenge, we proposed MedVL-SAM2, a unified 3D medical multimodal model that concurrently supports report generation, VQA, and multi-paradigm segmentation, including semantic, referring, and interactive segmentation. MedVL-SAM2 integrates image-level reasoning and pixel-level perception through a cohesive architecture tailored for 3D medical imaging, and incorporates a SAM2-based volumetric segmentation module to enable precise multi-granular spatial reasoning. The model is trained in a multi-stage pipeline: it is first pre-trained on a large-scale corpus of 3D CT image-text pairs to align volumetric visual features with radiology-language embeddings. It is then jointly optimized with both language-understanding and segmentation objectives using a comprehensive 3D CT segmentation dataset. This joint training enables flexible interaction via language, point, or box prompts, thereby unifying high-level visual reasoning with spatially precise localization. Our unified architecture delivers state-of-the-art performance across report generation, VQA, and multiple 3D segmentation tasks. Extensive analyses further show that the model provides reliable 3D visual grounding, controllable interactive segmentation, and robust cross-modal reasoning, demonstrating that high-level semantic reasoning and precise 3D localization can be jointly achieved within a unified 3D medical VLM.

*Weili Nie,Julius Berner,Nanye Ma,Chao Liu,Saining Xie,Arash Vahdat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Transition Matching Distillation (TMD), a method to distill large video diffusion models into more efficient, few-step generators for real-time video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the inefficiency of multi-step sampling in video diffusion models, which limits their use in real-time interactive applications.

Method: The paper proposes a two-component model: (1) a main backbone for semantic representation extraction and (2) a flow head for performing efficient multiple flow updates during transitions. TMD uses a flow head and applies distribution matching distillation to align the multi-step denoising trajectory into a few-step process.

Result: Experiments on Wan2.1 1.3B and 14B text-to-video models show that TMD achieves a balance between generation speed and visual quality and outperforms existing distilled models under similar inference costs.

Conclusion: TMD enables efficient and high-quality video generation, offering a robust trade-off between real-time performance and visual output quality, making it suitable for practical applications.

Abstract: Large video diffusion and flow models have achieved remarkable success in high-quality video generation, but their use in real-time interactive applications remains limited due to their inefficient multi-step sampling process. In this work, we present Transition Matching Distillation (TMD), a novel framework for distilling video diffusion models into efficient few-step generators. The central idea of TMD is to match the multi-step denoising trajectory of a diffusion model with a few-step probability transition process, where each transition is modeled as a lightweight conditional flow. To enable efficient distillation, we decompose the original diffusion backbone into two components: (1) a main backbone, comprising the majority of early layers, that extracts semantic representations at each outer transition step; and (2) a flow head, consisting of the last few layers, that leverages these representations to perform multiple inner flow updates. Given a pretrained video diffusion model, we first introduce a flow head to the model, and adapt it into a conditional flow map. We then apply distribution matching distillation to the student model with flow head rollout in each transition step. Extensive experiments on distilling Wan2.1 1.3B and 14B text-to-video models demonstrate that TMD provides a flexible and strong trade-off between generation speed and visual quality. In particular, TMD outperforms existing distilled models under comparable inference costs in terms of visual fidelity and prompt adherence. Project page: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/genair/tmd

TL;DR: This paper introduces OT-Drive, an Optimal Transport-driven framework that combines RGB and surface normal data for traversable area segmentation, outperforming previous methods in handling unstructured environments and unseen scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving systems face challenges in reliably segmenting traversable areas, mainly in out-of-distribution environments where existing methods often fail.

Method: OT-Drive uses a Scene Anchor Generator (SAG) to construct semantic anchors based on scene distributions and employs an Optimal Transport-based multi-modal fusion (OT Fusion) for robust segmentation.

Result: The method achieves 95.16% mIoU in OOD scenarios, a 6.35% improvement over prior methods, and 89.79% mIoU in cross-dataset tasks, surpassing baselines by 13.99%.

Conclusion: OT-Drive demonstrates strong generalization in OOD scenarios with limited training data, making it highly practical and efficient for real-world autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Reliable traversable area segmentation in unstructured environments is critical for planning and decision-making in autonomous driving. However, existing data-driven approaches often suffer from degraded segmentation performance in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios, consequently impairing downstream driving tasks. To address this issue, we propose OT-Drive, an Optimal Transport--driven multi-modal fusion framework. The proposed method formulates RGB and surface normal fusion as a distribution transport problem. Specifically, we design a novel Scene Anchor Generator (SAG) to decompose scene information into the joint distribution of weather, time-of-day, and road type, thereby constructing semantic anchors that can generalize to unseen scenarios. Subsequently, we design an innovative Optimal Transport-based multi-modal fusion module (OT Fusion) to transport RGB and surface normal features onto the manifold defined by the semantic anchors, enabling robust traversable area segmentation under OOD scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves 95.16% mIoU on ORFD OOD scenarios, outperforming prior methods by 6.35%, and 89.79% mIoU on cross-dataset transfer tasks, surpassing baselines by 13.99%.These results indicate that the proposed model can attain strong OOD generalization with only limited training data, substantially enhancing its practicality and efficiency for real-world deployment.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the limitation of vision-language models (VLMs) in capturing spatial relationships due to 1D image encoding and explores alternative methods to improve spatial reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs critical for applications like robotics and embodied AI.

Method: The authors investigate the use of alternative objectives for training image encoders and employ 2D positional encodings.

Result: The study demonstrates improved spatial reasoning on multiple benchmarks through these architectural enhancements.

Conclusion: Incorporating alternative training objectives and 2D structures enhances VLMs' spatial reasoning, paving the way for better performance in spatially-grounded applications.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced rapidly, but their ability to capture spatial relationships remains a blindspot. Current VLMs are typically built with contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) style image encoders. The training recipe often flattens images into 1D patch sequences, discarding the 2D structure necessary for spatial reasoning. We argue that this lack of spatial awareness is a missing dimension in VLM design and a bottleneck for applications requiring spatial grounding, such as robotics and embodied AI. To address this, we investigate (i) image encoders trained with alternative objectives and (ii) 2D positional encodings. Our experiments show that these architectural choices can lead to improved spatial reasoning on several benchmarks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DR$^2$Seg, a framework addressing inefficiencies in reasoning segmentation by employing a two-stage rollout strategy, resulting in improved reasoning efficiency and segmentation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reasoning segmentation methods often overthink by generating excessive reasoning chains that hinder effective object localization.

Method: The proposed DR$^2$Seg comprises a two-stage rollout process: (1) generating a self-contained description for the target object and (2) verifying its validity by replacing the original query with the simplified description. Self-rewards are integrated to refine reasoning precision and suppress redundancy.

Result: Extensive experiments show that DR$^2$Seg enhances reasoning efficiency and segmentation performance across various scales of multimodal large language and segmentation models.

Conclusion: DR$^2$Seg effectively addresses overthinking in reasoning segmentation tasks, achieving superior performance without extra supervision.

Abstract: Reasoning segmentation is an emerging vision-language task that requires reasoning over intricate text queries to precisely segment objects. However, existing methods typically suffer from overthinking, generating verbose reasoning chains that interfere with object localization in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). To address this issue, we propose DR$^2$Seg, a self-rewarding framework that improves both reasoning efficiency and segmentation accuracy without requiring extra thinking supervision. DR$^2$Seg employs a two-stage rollout strategy that decomposes reasoning segmentation into multimodal reasoning and referring segmentation. In the first stage, the model generates a self-contained description that explicitly specifies the target object. In the second stage, this description replaces the original complex query to verify its self-containment. Based on this design, two self-rewards are introduced to strengthen goal-oriented reasoning and suppress redundant thinking. Extensive experiments across MLLMs of varying scales and segmentation models demonstrate that DR$^2$Seg consistently improves reasoning efficiency and overall segmentation performance.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new method (DW-DGAT) to improve early diagnosis of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases using neuroimaging and phenotypic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the challenges of high-dimensional multi-metric data, heterogeneity in data structures, and class imbalance for early neurodegenerative disease diagnosis.

Method: The proposed method uses dynamically weighted dual graph attention networks, combining data fusion, dual graph attention based on brain and inter-sample relations, and a class weight generation mechanism to handle imbalanced data.

Result: The model demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on datasets from PPMI and ADNI studies through rigorous experiments.

Conclusion: DW-DGAT proves highly effective for early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases by addressing key challenges in data processing and classification.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are the two most prevalent and incurable neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) worldwide, for which early diagnosis is critical to delay their progression. However, the high dimensionality of multi-metric data with diverse structural forms, the heterogeneity of neuroimaging and phenotypic data, and class imbalance collectively pose significant challenges to early ND diagnosis. To address these challenges, we propose a dynamically weighted dual graph attention network (DW-DGAT) that integrates: (1) a general-purpose data fusion strategy to merge three structural forms of multi-metric data; (2) a dual graph attention architecture based on brain regions and inter-sample relationships to extract both micro- and macro-level features; and (3) a class weight generation mechanism combined with two stable and effective loss functions to mitigate class imbalance. Rigorous experiments, based on the Parkinson Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) and Alzhermer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) studies, demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces VERHallu, a benchmark to evaluate Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) on event relation hallucinations in videos, and proposes a Key-Frame Propagating (KFP) strategy to address these issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event relation hallucination in VideoLLMs, such as faulty causal, temporal, and subevent reasoning, has been largely overlooked, necessitating a benchmark for evaluation and improvement.

Method: The authors developed VERHallu, a benchmark with tasks like relation classification, question answering, and counterfactual reasoning, and proposed the Key-Frame Propagating (KFP) strategy to improve frame-level attention for better multi-event understanding.

Result: The analysis demonstrated that current VideoLLMs fail in dense-event relation reasoning and exhibit event relation hallucinations. The KFP strategy showed effectiveness in addressing these shortcomings while maintaining inference speed.

Conclusion: VERHallu provides a comprehensive evaluation platform for event relation hallucination in VideoLLMs. The proposed KFP strategy improves event relation reasoning, addressing a key limitation of current models.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) exhibit various types of hallucinations. Existing research has primarily focused on hallucinations involving the presence of events, objects, and scenes in videos, while largely neglecting event relation hallucination. In this paper, we introduce a novel benchmark for evaluating the Video Event Relation Hallucination, named VERHallu. This benchmark focuses on causal, temporal, and subevent relations between events, encompassing three types of tasks: relation classification, question answering, and counterfactual question answering, for a comprehensive evaluation of event relation hallucination. Additionally, it features counterintuitive video scenarios that deviate from typical pretraining distributions, with each sample accompanied by human-annotated candidates covering both vision-language and pure language biases. Our analysis reveals that current state-of-the-art VideoLLMs struggle with dense-event relation reasoning, often relying on prior knowledge due to insufficient use of frame-level cues. Although these models demonstrate strong grounding capabilities for key events, they often overlook the surrounding subevents, leading to an incomplete and inaccurate understanding of event relations. To tackle this, we propose a Key-Frame Propagating (KFP) strategy, which reallocates frame-level attention within intermediate layers to enhance multi-event understanding. Experiments show it effectively mitigates the event relation hallucination without affecting inference speed.

*Giyeol Kim,Chanho Eom*

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel framework called DiCo to enhance text-to-image person re-identification by achieving hierarchical and disentangled cross-modal alignment via slot-based representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The text-to-image person re-identification field faces challenges due to the disparity between visual data and textual descriptions and the difficulty in identifying individuals with similar attributes.

Method: The proposed DiCo framework uses slot-based representations where slots act as anchors across image and text modalities. These slots are decomposed into concept blocks representing attributes like color and texture.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets (CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, RSTPReid) show competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, improving retrieval interpretability.

Conclusion: DiCo provides a more fine-grained retrieval system and enhances interpretability with slot- and block-level representations, addressing modality gaps and achieving competitive results in the field.

Abstract: Text-to-image person re-identification (TIReID) aims to retrieve person images from a large gallery given free-form textual descriptions. TIReID is challenging due to the substantial modality gap between visual appearances and textual expressions, as well as the need to model fine-grained correspondences that distinguish individuals with similar attributes such as clothing color, texture, or outfit style. To address these issues, we propose DiCo (Disentangled Concept Representation), a novel framework that achieves hierarchical and disentangled cross-modal alignment. DiCo introduces a shared slot-based representation, where each slot acts as a part-level anchor across modalities and is further decomposed into multiple concept blocks. This design enables the disentanglement of complementary attributes (\textit{e.g.}, color, texture, shape) while maintaining consistent part-level correspondence between image and text. Extensive experiments on CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid demonstrate that our framework achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods, while also enhancing interpretability through explicit slot- and block-level representations for more fine-grained retrieval results.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a synthetic benchmark dataset for event-based optical flow in underwater environments, addressing challenges in underwater imaging and enabling algorithm evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater imaging suffers from light attenuation, scattering, and turbidity, impeding standard cameras and motion detection. Event cameras offer promise, but lack paired datasets for underwater exploration.

Method: The authors developed a synthetic dataset generated from ray-traced RGBD sequences and applied a video-to-event pipeline to simulate realistic underwater event data, with dense ground truth for evaluation.

Result: The dataset includes ground-truth flow, depth, and camera motion. Benchmark evaluations with current optical flow prediction methods were performed to assess algorithm performance under underwater conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed dataset establishes a baseline for advancing underwater event-based perception algorithms and offers publicly accessible tools for further studies.

Abstract: Underwater imaging is fundamentally challenging due to wavelength-dependent light attenuation, strong scattering from suspended particles, turbidity-induced blur, and non-uniform illumination. These effects impair standard cameras and make ground-truth motion nearly impossible to obtain. On the other hand, event cameras offer microsecond resolution and high dynamic range. Nonetheless, progress on investigating event cameras for underwater environments has been limited due to the lack of datasets that pair realistic underwater optics with accurate optical flow. To address this problem, we introduce the first synthetic underwater benchmark dataset for event-based optical flow derived from physically-based ray-traced RGBD sequences. Using a modern video-to-event pipeline applied to rendered underwater videos, we produce realistic event data streams with dense ground-truth flow, depth, and camera motion. Moreover, we benchmark state-of-the-art learning-based and model-based optical flow prediction methods to understand how underwater light transport affects event formation and motion estimation accuracy. Our dataset establishes a new baseline for future development and evaluation of underwater event-based perception algorithms.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoF-T2I, a model integrating Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning into text-to-image generation by leveraging intermediate visual reasoning steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the absence of defined reasoning steps and intermediate states in text-to-image (T2I) generation, which limits the application of video-based models.

Method: Proposed CoF-T2I, which uses progressive visual refinement with intermediate frames as reasoning steps, leveraging a new dataset (CoF-Evol-Instruct) and independent frame encoding.

Result: CoF-T2I significantly outperforms baseline video models and achieves high scores on benchmarks like GenEval (0.86) and Imagine-Bench (7.468).

Conclusion: Chain-of-Frame reasoning offers significant potential to elevate text-to-image generation quality, showcasing the utility of video models in bridging semantics and aesthetics.

Abstract: Recent video generation models have revealed the emergence of Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning, enabling frame-by-frame visual inference. With this capability, video models have been successfully applied to various visual tasks (e.g., maze solving, visual puzzles). However, their potential to enhance text-to-image (T2I) generation remains largely unexplored due to the absence of a clearly defined visual reasoning starting point and interpretable intermediate states in the T2I generation process. To bridge this gap, we propose CoF-T2I, a model that integrates CoF reasoning into T2I generation via progressive visual refinement, where intermediate frames act as explicit reasoning steps and the final frame is taken as output. To establish such an explicit generation process, we curate CoF-Evol-Instruct, a dataset of CoF trajectories that model the generation process from semantics to aesthetics. To further improve quality and avoid motion artifacts, we enable independent encoding operation for each frame. Experiments show that CoF-T2I significantly outperforms the base video model and achieves competitive performance on challenging benchmarks, reaching 0.86 on GenEval and 7.468 on Imagine-Bench. These results indicate the substantial promise of video models for advancing high-quality text-to-image generation.

*Yue Chang,Rufeng Chen,Zhaofan Zhang,Yi Chen,Sihong Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method called RAG-3DSG for improving open-vocabulary 3D Scene Graphs by addressing challenges like low object recognition accuracy and slow performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to enhance robotics tasks like manipulation and navigation by improving the generation of open-vocabulary 3D Scene Graphs, which face issues like constrained viewpoints, occlusions, and slow object recognition.

Method: The proposed RAG-3DSG uses re-shot guided uncertainty estimation to reduce aggregation noise, a retrieval-augmented generation strategy for reliable object recognition, and a dynamic downsample-mapping strategy to enhance processing speed.

Result: Experiments on the Replica dataset show that RAG-3DSG improves object recognition accuracy and reduces mapping time by two-thirds compared to the standard version.

Conclusion: RAG-3DSG provides a significant step forward in both accuracy and speed for 3DSG generation, making it particularly beneficial for robotics tasks.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D Scene Graph (3DSG) generation can enhance various downstream tasks in robotics, such as manipulation and navigation, by leveraging structured semantic representations. A 3DSG is constructed from multiple images of a scene, where objects are represented as nodes and relationships as edges. However, existing works for open-vocabulary 3DSG generation suffer from both low object-level recognition accuracy and speed, mainly due to constrained viewpoints, occlusions, and redundant surface density. To address these challenges, we propose RAG-3DSG to mitigate aggregation noise through re-shot guided uncertainty estimation and support object-level Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) via reliable low-uncertainty objects. Furthermore, we propose a dynamic downsample-mapping strategy to accelerate cross-image object aggregation with adaptive granularity. Experiments on Replica dataset demonstrate that RAG-3DSG significantly improves node captioning accuracy in 3DSG generation while reducing the mapping time by two-thirds compared to the vanilla version.

*Hyun Do Jung,Jungwon Choi,Hwiyoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces ReaMIL, a reasoning- and evidence-aware multiple instance learning (MIL) method for analyzing whole-slide histopathology, which improves evidence-efficiency while maintaining high performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the efficiency and interpretability of multiple instance learning in histopathology by selecting compact evidence sets without sacrificing classification accuracy.

Method: ReaMIL incorporates a lightweight selection head into an MIL framework, using a budgeted-sufficiency hinge loss to enforce class probabilities with a sparsity constraint on the selected tiles, leading to compact evidence sets.

Result: ReaMIL achieves high performance across datasets (e.g., AUC of 0.983 for NSCLC) while reducing the minimal sufficient number of selected tiles and offering robust diagnostic insights such as contiguity and quantitative evidence-efficiency.

Conclusion: ReaMIL is an efficient, interpretable, and seamlessly integrative MIL approach for histopathology that does not require extra supervision and delivers insightful evaluation metrics for whole-slide images.

Abstract: We introduce ReaMIL (Reasoning- and Evidence-Aware MIL), a multiple instance learning approach for whole-slide histopathology that adds a light selection head to a strong MIL backbone. The head produces soft per-tile gates and is trained with a budgeted-sufficiency objective: a hinge loss that enforces the true-class probability to be $\geq τ$ using only the kept evidence, under a sparsity budget on the number of selected tiles. The budgeted-sufficiency objective yields small, spatially compact evidence sets without sacrificing baseline performance. Across TCGA-NSCLC (LUAD vs. LUSC), TCGA-BRCA (IDC vs. Others), and PANDA, ReaMIL matches or slightly improves baseline AUC and provides quantitative evidence-efficiency diagnostics. On NSCLC, it attains AUC 0.983 with a mean minimal sufficient K (MSK) $\approx 8.2$ tiles at $τ= 0.90$ and AUKC $\approx 0.864$, showing that class confidence rises sharply and stabilizes once a small set of tiles is kept. The method requires no extra supervision, integrates seamlessly with standard MIL training, and naturally yields slide-level overlays. We report accuracy alongside MSK, AUKC, and contiguity for rigorous evaluation of model behavior on WSIs.

### [154] [Thinking Like Van Gogh: Structure-Aware Style Transfer via Flow-Guided 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10075)
*Zhendong Wang,Lebin Zhou,Jingchuan Xiao,Rongduo Han,Nam Ling,Cihan Ruan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a 3D style transfer method that better captures Post-Impressionist art principles, focusing on flow-guided geometric abstraction for stylization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D style transfer methods don’t authentically reproduce Post-Impressionist styles as they rigidly project texture onto fixed geometry, rather than embracing geometric abstraction.

Method: The method uses a flow-guided geometric advection framework in 3D Gaussian Splatting, extracting flow fields from 2D paintings to deform 3D Gaussian primitives and create brushstroke effects without relying on explicit meshes.

Result: The approach effectively produces expressive, topology-conforming deformations via painterly motion, while mitigating artifacts through luminance-structure decoupling and introducing an artistic evaluation metric.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges the gap in 3D art stylization by enabling mesh-free geometric abstraction guided by 2D artistic flows, honoring subjective artistic authenticity.

Abstract: In 1888, Vincent van Gogh wrote, "I am seeking exaggeration in the essential." This principle, amplifying structural form while suppressing photographic detail, lies at the core of Post-Impressionist art. However, most existing 3D style transfer methods invert this philosophy, treating geometry as a rigid substrate for surface-level texture projection. To authentically reproduce Post-Impressionist stylization, geometric abstraction must be embraced as the primary vehicle of expression.
  We propose a flow-guided geometric advection framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that operationalizes this principle in a mesh-free setting. Our method extracts directional flow fields from 2D paintings and back-propagates them into 3D space, rectifying Gaussian primitives to form flow-aligned brushstrokes that conform to scene topology without relying on explicit mesh priors. This enables expressive structural deformation driven directly by painterly motion rather than photometric constraints.
  Our contributions are threefold: (1) a projection-based, mesh-free flow guidance mechanism that transfers 2D artistic motion into 3D Gaussian geometry; (2) a luminance-structure decoupling strategy that isolates geometric deformation from color optimization, mitigating artifacts during aggressive structural abstraction; and (3) a VLM-as-a-Judge evaluation framework that assesses artistic authenticity through aesthetic judgment instead of conventional pixel-level metrics, explicitly addressing the subjective nature of artistic stylization.

*Amir Mallak,Erfan Aasi,Shiva Sreeram,Tsun-Hsuan Wang,Daniela Rus,Alaa Maalouf*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes Stochastic-Patch-Selection (SPS) for training policies on partially randomized patch descriptors, achieving superior OOD robustness in end-to-end autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the problem of overfitting to spurious correlations in end-to-end autonomous driving policies trained with redundant, self-attentive patch-aligned features, which impairs Out-of-Distribution (OOD) robustness.

Method: Stochastic-Patch-Selection (SPS) randomly masks a fraction of patch descriptors in each frame while preserving their spatial structure, encouraging the policy to base its decisions on invariant features across different stochastic projections of a scene.

Result: SPS outperforms state-of-the-art methods by an average of 6.2% and up to 20.4% in closed-loop autonomous driving simulations, with a 2.4x speed improvement. It also demonstrates successful real-world transferability without additional tuning.

Conclusion: Stochastic-Patch-Selection enhances the robustness and generalizability of autonomous driving policies by addressing information redundancy, achieving impressive results in both simulations and real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end autonomous driving show that policies trained on patch-aligned features extracted from foundation models generalize better to Out-of-Distribution (OOD). We hypothesize that due to the self-attention mechanism, each patch feature implicitly embeds/contains information from all other patches, represented in a different way and intensity, making these descriptors highly redundant. We quantify redundancy in such (BLIP2) features via PCA and cross-patch similarity: $90$% of variance is captured by $17/64$ principal components, and strong inter-token correlations are pervasive. Training on such overlapping information leads the policy to overfit spurious correlations, hurting OOD robustness. We present Stochastic-Patch-Selection (SPS), a simple yet effective approach for learning policies that are more robust, generalizable, and efficient. For every frame, SPS randomly masks a fraction of patch descriptors, not feeding them to the policy model, while preserving the spatial layout of the remaining patches. Thus, the policy is provided with different stochastic but complete views of the (same) scene: every random subset of patches acts like a different, yet still sensible, coherent projection of the world. The policy thus bases its decisions on features that are invariant to which specific tokens survive. Extensive experiments confirm that across all OOD scenarios, our method outperforms the state of the art (SOTA), achieving a $6.2$% average improvement and up to $20.4$% in closed-loop simulations, while being $2.4\times$ faster. We conduct ablations over masking rates and patch-feature reorganization, training and evaluating 9 systems, with 8 of them surpassing prior SOTA. Finally, we show that the same learned policy transfers to a physical, real-world car without any tuning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Difficulty-Guided Sampling (DGS) to improve dataset distillation by addressing a gap between distillation objectives and downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to improve dataset distillation by addressing the target gap between the distillation objective and downstream task, enhancing performance in downstream tasks such as image classification.

Method: The paper proposes a post-stage sampling module (DGS) to incorporate task-specific difficulty characteristics into dataset distillation and introduces Difficulty-Aware Guidance (DAG) to explore difficulty in the distillation process.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that DGS and DAG effectively improve distilled dataset quality and showcase potential for broader downstream tasks.

Conclusion: DGS effectively addresses the target gap, improves dataset distillation quality, and demonstrates potential for diverse applications, emphasizing the importance of task-specific difficulty.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose difficulty-guided sampling (DGS) to bridge the target gap between the distillation objective and the downstream task, therefore improving the performance of dataset distillation. Deep neural networks achieve remarkable performance but have time and storage-consuming training processes. Dataset distillation is proposed to generate compact, high-quality distilled datasets, enabling effective model training while maintaining downstream performance. Existing approaches typically focus on features extracted from the original dataset, overlooking task-specific information, which leads to a target gap between the distillation objective and the downstream task. We propose leveraging characteristics that benefit the downstream training into data distillation to bridge this gap. Focusing on the downstream task of image classification, we introduce the concept of difficulty and propose DGS as a plug-in post-stage sampling module. Following the specific target difficulty distribution, the final distilled dataset is sampled from image pools generated by existing methods. We also propose difficulty-aware guidance (DAG) to explore the effect of difficulty in the generation process. Extensive experiments across multiple settings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. It also highlights the broader potential of difficulty for diverse downstream tasks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces V-Zero, a post-training framework for vision-language models that enhances reasoning using only unlabeled images, without relying on human-annotated datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the reliance of vision-language models on costly and time-intensive human-annotated datasets by enabling self-improvement through unlabeled data.

Method: V-Zero uses a co-evolutionary loop with two roles: the Questioner, which synthesizes high-quality questions, and the Solver, which generates pseudo-labels for training. These roles are iteratively trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO).

Result: The V-Zero framework demonstrates improved performance for multimodal systems, with specific gains of +1.7 in visual mathematical reasoning and +2.6 in general vision-centric tasks, without needing human annotations.

Conclusion: This work validates the potential of self-improvement in vision-language models using unlabeled data, highlighting a cost-efficient and effective alternative to traditional annotated datasets.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal learning have significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). However, state-of-the-art approaches rely heavily on large-scale human-annotated datasets, which are costly and time-consuming to acquire. To overcome this limitation, we introduce V-Zero, a general post-training framework that facilitates self-improvement using exclusively unlabeled images. V-Zero establishes a co-evolutionary loop by instantiating two distinct roles: a Questioner and a Solver. The Questioner learns to synthesize high-quality, challenging questions by leveraging a dual-track reasoning reward that contrasts intuitive guesses with reasoned results. The Solver is optimized using pseudo-labels derived from majority voting over its own sampled responses. Both roles are trained iteratively via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), driving a cycle of mutual enhancement. Remarkably, without a single human annotation, V-Zero achieves consistent performance gains on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, improving visual mathematical reasoning by +1.7 and general vision-centric by +2.6, demonstrating the potential of self-improvement in multimodal systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents InfoSculpt, an information-theoretic framework for Generalized Category Discovery (GCD), which leverages Conditional Mutual Information to better separate category-defining signals from noise, achieving robust results in handling known and novel categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of classifying instances from both known and novel categories in an unlabeled dataset, overcoming the limitations of two-stage clustering and pseudo-labeling approaches which fail to distinguish essential category-defining signals from noise.

Method: The paper reframes GCD with the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle and introduces InfoSculpt, which minimizes a dual Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) objective, combining Category-Level CMI for labeled data and Instance-Level CMI to compress augmentation noise, creating disentangled representations.

Result: InfoSculpt demonstrates its effectiveness across 8 benchmarks, showcasing improved ability to classify both known and novel categories through more robust disentanglement of signals and noise.

Conclusion: The study establishes a novel approach for GCD using information theory, proving InfoSculpt as a potent solution to discovering categories in large-scale, open-world datasets by effectively removing noise and preserving categorical information.

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to classify instances from both known and novel categories within a large-scale unlabeled dataset, a critical yet challenging task for real-world, open-world applications. However, existing methods often rely on pseudo-labeling, or two-stage clustering, which lack a principled mechanism to explicitly disentangle essential, category-defining signals from instance-specific noise. In this paper, we address this fundamental limitation by re-framing GCD from an information-theoretic perspective, grounded in the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle. We introduce InfoSculpt, a novel framework that systematically sculpts the representation space by minimizing a dual Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) objective. InfoSculpt uniquely combines a Category-Level CMI on labeled data to learn compact and discriminative representations for known classes, and a complementary Instance-Level CMI on all data to distill invariant features by compressing augmentation-induced noise. These two objectives work synergistically at different scales to produce a disentangled and robust latent space where categorical information is preserved while noisy, instance-specific details are discarded. Extensive experiments on 8 benchmarks demonstrate that InfoSculpt validating the effectiveness of our information-theoretic approach.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video synthesis methods cannot balance high-quality visuals and real-time interaction needs for humanoid agents.

Method: FlowAct-R1 utilizes MMDiT architecture, chunkwise diffusion forcing strategies, and system-level optimizations for streaming video synthesis.

Result: FlowAct-R1 achieves continuous interaction at 25fps (480p) with low latency (1.5s TTFF), ensuring vivid and natural humanoid behaviors.

Conclusion: FlowAct-R1 effectively balances synthesis fidelity and interaction performance, showcasing promising capabilities for lifelike interactive video agents.

Abstract: Interactive humanoid video generation aims to synthesize lifelike visual agents that can engage with humans through continuous and responsive video. Despite recent advances in video synthesis, existing methods often grapple with the trade-off between high-fidelity synthesis and real-time interaction requirements. In this paper, we propose FlowAct-R1, a framework specifically designed for real-time interactive humanoid video generation. Built upon a MMDiT architecture, FlowAct-R1 enables the streaming synthesis of video with arbitrary durations while maintaining low-latency responsiveness. We introduce a chunkwise diffusion forcing strategy, complemented by a novel self-forcing variant, to alleviate error accumulation and ensure long-term temporal consistency during continuous interaction. By leveraging efficient distillation and system-level optimizations, our framework achieves a stable 25fps at 480p resolution with a time-to-first-frame (TTFF) of only around 1.5 seconds. The proposed method provides holistic and fine-grained full-body control, enabling the agent to transition naturally between diverse behavioral states in interactive scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that FlowAct-R1 achieves exceptional behavioral vividness and perceptual realism, while maintaining robust generalization across diverse character styles.

Motivation: To address the lack of robust benchmarks for analyzing paper-based math exams with severe visual noise and structural integrity challenges.

Method: Developed MathDoc, a benchmark with 3,609 curated questions, including unrecognizable samples, and proposed a multi-dimensional evaluation framework for assessing model performance.

Result: Experiments show that SOTA models perform well on extraction but fail to refuse illegible inputs, producing confident yet invalid outputs.

Conclusion: MathDoc is established as a key benchmark to evaluate MLLMs' reliability and active refusal capability under degraded document conditions.

Abstract: The automated extraction of structured questions from paper-based mathematics exams is fundamental to intelligent education, yet remains challenging in real-world settings due to severe visual noise. Existing benchmarks mainly focus on clean documents or generic layout analysis, overlooking both the structural integrity of mathematical problems and the ability of models to actively reject incomplete inputs. We introduce MathDoc, the first benchmark for document-level information extraction from authentic high school mathematics exam papers. MathDoc contains \textbf{3,609} carefully curated questions with real-world artifacts and explicitly includes unrecognizable samples to evaluate active refusal behavior. We propose a multi-dimensional evaluation framework covering stem accuracy, visual similarity, and refusal capability. Experiments on SOTA MLLMs, including Qwen3-VL and Gemini-2.5-Pro, show that although end-to-end models achieve strong extraction performance, they consistently fail to refuse illegible inputs, instead producing confident but invalid outputs. These results highlight a critical gap in current MLLMs and establish MathDoc as a benchmark for assessing model reliability under degraded document conditions.

### [161] [Enhancing Visual In-Context Learning by Multi-Faceted Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10107)
*Wenwen Liao,Jianbo Yu,Yuansong Wang,Qingchao Jiang,Xiaofeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a collaborative framework for Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) which utilizes multiple prompts instead of a single one, improving task performance across various visual tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VICL methods rely on selecting a single visual prompt or collapsing multiple prompts into one, which limits the model's reasoning ability and utilization of diverse contextual cues.

Method: The proposed approach uses a multi-combination collaborative fusion strategy. It forms contextual representation branches based on top-K visual prompts and integrates them into a MULTI-VQGAN architecture for collaborative information interpretation from diverse sources.

Result: The framework demonstrates strong cross-task generalization, effective contextual fusion, and better performance on tasks like foreground segmentation, single-object detection, and image colorization compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that moving from single-prompt to multi-combination collaborative fusion in VICL enables more robust and accurate visual processing, unlocking its full potential across tasks.

Abstract: Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm, enabling models to perform novel visual tasks by learning from in-context examples. The dominant "retrieve-then-prompt" approach typically relies on selecting the single best visual prompt, a practice that often discards valuable contextual information from other suitable candidates. While recent work has explored fusing the top-K prompts into a single, enhanced representation, this still simply collapses multiple rich signals into one, limiting the model's reasoning capability. We argue that a more multi-faceted, collaborative fusion is required to unlock the full potential of these diverse contexts. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel framework that moves beyond single-prompt fusion towards an multi-combination collaborative fusion. Instead of collapsing multiple prompts into one, our method generates three contextual representation branches, each formed by integrating information from different combinations of top-quality prompts. These complementary guidance signals are then fed into proposed MULTI-VQGAN architecture, which is designed to jointly interpret and utilize collaborative information from multiple sources. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks, including foreground segmentation, single-object detection, and image colorization, highlight its strong cross-task generalization, effective contextual fusion, and ability to produce more robust and accurate predictions than existing methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an end-to-end framework to improve Vision In-Context Learning (VICL) by aggregating multiple prompts and using arrangement-specific modules, demonstrating better performance across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VICL methods discard valuable information from multiple prompts and fail to account for structured prompt arrangements, limiting performance.

Method: A fusion module aggregates patterns from multiple prompts, arrangement-specific lightweight MLPs address layout priors, and bidirectional fine-tuning enhances collaboration between components.

Result: The proposed approach achieves superior results in tasks like foreground segmentation, object detection, and image colorization with strong cross-task generalization.

Conclusion: The method effectively enhances VICL by addressing its limitations, leading to better task performance and adaptability.

Abstract: Vision In-Context Learning (VICL) enables inpainting models to quickly adapt to new visual tasks from only a few prompts. However, existing methods suffer from two key issues: (1) selecting only the most similar prompt discards complementary cues from other high-quality prompts; and (2) failing to exploit the structured information implied by different prompt arrangements.
  We propose an end-to-end VICL framework to overcome these limitations. Firstly, an adaptive Fusion Module aggregates critical patterns and annotations from multiple prompts to form more precise contextual prompts. Secondly, we introduce arrangement-specific lightweight MLPs to decouple layout priors from the core model, while minimally affecting the overall model. In addition, an bidirectional fine-tuning mechanism swaps the roles of query and prompt, encouraging the model to reconstruct the original prompt from fused context and thus enhancing collaboration between the fusion module and the inpainting model. Experiments on foreground segmentation, single-object detection, and image colorization demonstrate superior results and strong cross-task generalization of our method.

TL;DR: The paper introduces VQ-Seg, a novel semi-supervised medical image segmentation approach using vector quantization to replace dropout for better regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing perturbation methods in semi-supervised medical image segmentation rely heavily on sensitive hyperparameters like dropout rates, which are challenging to tune and may lead to suboptimal outcomes.

Method: VQ-Seg employs vector quantization to discretize feature space, introduces a Quantized Perturbation Module (QPM) for controllable regularization, incorporates guidance from foundation models via the Post-VQ Feature Adapter (PFA), and uses a dual-branch architecture for image reconstruction and segmentation tasks.

Result: Experiments on a newly collected Lung Cancer dataset and public benchmarks show that VQ-Seg achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: VQ-Seg is an effective and controllable approach for semi-supervised medical image segmentation, presenting advancements in regularization and segmentation accuracy.

Abstract: Consistency learning with feature perturbation is a widely used strategy in semi-supervised medical image segmentation. However, many existing perturbation methods rely on dropout, and thus require a careful manual tuning of the dropout rate, which is a sensitive hyperparameter and often difficult to optimize and may lead to suboptimal regularization. To overcome this limitation, we propose VQ-Seg, the first approach to employ vector quantization (VQ) to discretize the feature space and introduce a novel and controllable Quantized Perturbation Module (QPM) that replaces dropout. Our QPM perturbs discrete representations by shuffling the spatial locations of codebook indices, enabling effective and controllable regularization. To mitigate potential information loss caused by quantization, we design a dual-branch architecture where the post-quantization feature space is shared by both image reconstruction and segmentation tasks. Moreover, we introduce a Post-VQ Feature Adapter (PFA) to incorporate guidance from a foundation model (FM), supplementing the high-level semantic information lost during quantization. Furthermore, we collect a large-scale Lung Cancer (LC) dataset comprising 828 CT scans annotated for central-type lung carcinoma. Extensive experiments on the LC dataset and other public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Method: LaViT forces the student model to autoregressively reconstruct the teacher's visual semantics and attention trajectories before text generation, with a sensory gating mechanism to avoid shortcuts.

Result: Experiments reveal LaViT improves visual grounding by up to +16.9% on reasoning tasks and allows a smaller 3B model to outperform larger models, including GPT-4o.

Conclusion: LaViT offers a robust solution to bridge the Perception Gap, encouraging better alignment of visual-latent reasoning and improving performance on complex tasks.

Abstract: Current multimodal latent reasoning often relies on external supervision (e.g., auxiliary images), ignoring intrinsic visual attention dynamics. In this work, we identify a critical Perception Gap in distillation: student models frequently mimic a teacher's textual output while attending to fundamentally divergent visual regions, effectively relying on language priors rather than grounded perception. To bridge this, we propose LaViT, a framework that aligns latent visual thoughts rather than static embeddings. LaViT compels the student to autoregressively reconstruct the teacher's visual semantics and attention trajectories prior to text generation, employing a curriculum sensory gating mechanism to prevent shortcut learning. Extensive experiments show that LaViT significantly enhances visual grounding, achieving up to +16.9% gains on complex reasoning tasks and enabling a compact 3B model to outperform larger open-source variants and proprietary models like GPT-4o.

### [165] [Advancing Adaptive Multi-Stage Video Anomaly Reasoning: A Benchmark Dataset and Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10165)
*Chao Huang,Benfeng Wang,Wei Wang,Jie Wen,Li Shen,Wenqi Ren,Yong Xu,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Video Anomaly Reasoning (VAR) task, along with a new dataset and a model (Vad-R1-Plus) for structured anomaly reasoning in videos. The proposed methods significantly improve reasoning and decision-making in this domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) lack explicit reasoning, risk-awareness, and decision interpretation for video anomaly detection and understanding (VAD&U). This paper addresses the need for structured reasoning over video anomalies.

Method: The authors introduce the VAR task, a dataset with over 8,641 videos and 50,000 samples, and a reasoning method called Anomaly-Aware Group Relative Policy Optimization. They propose a model, Vad-R1-Plus, for adaptive reasoning over anomaly data.

Result: The Vad-R1-Plus model and datasets advance reasoning capabilities on video anomaly reasoning tasks, outperforming baseline models and enhancing decision-making processes.

Conclusion: The study contributes a significant step forward in anomaly analysis by introducing the VAR task, dataset, and a new model, demonstrating improved reasoning and decision-making in video anomaly understanding.

Abstract: Recent progress in reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) has highlighted their potential for performing complex video understanding tasks. However, in the domain of Video Anomaly Detection and Understanding (VAD&U), existing MLLM-based methods are largely limited to anomaly localization or post-hoc description, lacking explicit reasoning processes, risk awareness, and decision-oriented interpretation. To address this gap, we define a new task termed Video Anomaly Reasoning (VAR), which elevates video anomaly analysis from descriptive understanding to structured, multi-stage reasoning. VAR explicitly requires models to perform progressive reasoning over anomalous events before answering anomaly-related questions, encompassing visual perception, causal interpretation, and risk-aware decision making. To support this task, we present a new dataset with 8,641 videos, where each video is annotated with diverse question types corresponding to different reasoning depths, totaling more than 50,000 samples, making it one of the largest datasets for video anomaly. The annotations are based on a structured Perception-Cognition-Action Chain-of-Thought (PerCoAct-CoT), which formalizes domain-specific reasoning priors for video anomaly understanding. This design enables systematic evaluation of multi-stage and adaptive anomaly reasoning. In addition, we propose Anomaly-Aware Group Relative Policy Optimization to further enhance reasoning reliability under weak supervision. Building upon the proposed task and dataset, we develop an end-to-end MLLM-based VAR model termed Vad-R1-Plus, which supports adaptive hierarchical reasoning and risk-aware decision making. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed benchmark and method effectively advance the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs on VAR tasks, outperforming both open-source and proprietary baselines.

*Hu Gao,Xiaoning Lei,Xichen Xu,Xingjian Wang,Lizhuang Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method called OPIR for efficient multi-task image restoration using a task-aware inverse degradation operator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing all-in-one image restoration methods tend to increase complexity, hindering real-time applicability, thus requiring a more efficient approach.

Method: A two-stage framework involving the prediction of an inverse degradation operator, producing initial restorations, uncertainty maps, and later refining restoration based on these maps.

Result: The proposed OPIR architecture shows superior performance in all-in-one image restoration tasks, maintaining efficiency.

Conclusion: The OPIR method balances high restoration performance and efficiency, offering a new perspective by integrating physical degradation modeling.

Abstract: All-in-one image restoration aims to adaptively handle multiple restoration tasks with a single trained model. Although existing methods achieve promising results by introducing prompt information or leveraging large models, the added learning modules increase system complexity and hinder real-time applicability. In this paper, we adopt a physical degradation modeling perspective and predict a task-aware inverse degradation operator for efficient all-in-one image restoration. The framework consists of two stages. In the first stage, the predicted inverse operator produces an initial restored image together with an uncertainty perception map that highlights regions difficult to reconstruct, ensuring restoration reliability. In the second stage, the restoration is further refined under the guidance of this uncertainty map. The same inverse operator prediction network is used in both stages, with task-aware parameters introduced after operator prediction to adapt to different degradation tasks. Moreover, by accelerating the convolution of the inverse operator, the proposed method achieves efficient all-in-one image restoration. The resulting tightly integrated architecture, termed OPIR, is extensively validated through experiments, demonstrating superior all-in-one restoration performance while remaining highly competitive on task-aligned restoration.

*Kim Youwang,Lee Hyoseok,Subin Park,Gerard Pons-Moll,Tae-Hyun Oh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ELITE, a system for creating efficient and visually superior Gaussian head avatars from monocular video by combining 3D and 2D data priors. It achieves high fidelity, generalization, and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods for monocular video avatar synthesis either fail to generalize well in-the-wild or are computationally expensive and cause identity hallucination. This paper aims to address these limitations.

Method: The ELITE system integrates a Mesh2Gaussian Prior Model for fast Gaussian avatar initialization and introduces test-time generative adaptation through rendering-guided single-step diffusion, avoiding full diffusion denoising.

Result: ELITE demonstrates high-fidelity avatars capable of handling challenging expressions while being 60x faster than methods relying solely on 2D generative priors.

Conclusion: ELITE achieves efficient synthesis of animatable avatars with improved quality, generalization, and computational speed compared to existing works.

Abstract: We introduce ELITE, an Efficient Gaussian head avatar synthesis from a monocular video via Learned Initialization and TEst-time generative adaptation. Prior works rely either on a 3D data prior or a 2D generative prior to compensate for missing visual cues in monocular videos. However, 3D data prior methods often struggle to generalize in-the-wild, while 2D generative prior methods are computationally heavy and prone to identity hallucination. We identify a complementary synergy between these two priors and design an efficient system that achieves high-fidelity animatable avatar synthesis with strong in-the-wild generalization. Specifically, we introduce a feed-forward Mesh2Gaussian Prior Model (MGPM) that enables fast initialization of a Gaussian avatar. To further bridge the domain gap at test time, we design a test-time generative adaptation stage, leveraging both real and synthetic images as supervision. Unlike previous full diffusion denoising strategies that are slow and hallucination-prone, we propose a rendering-guided single-step diffusion enhancer that restores missing visual details, grounded on Gaussian avatar renderings. Our experiments demonstrate that ELITE produces visually superior avatars to prior works, even for challenging expressions, while achieving 60x faster synthesis than the 2D generative prior method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents DepthDirector, a video re-rendering framework that achieves precise camera control while preserving video content using depth information and a dual-stream mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for conditioned video generation struggle with precise camera control and maintaining subject consistency, often resulting in degraded quality.

Method: The authors introduce a View-Content Dual-Stream Condition mechanism that uses source video and warped depth data for guidance. They also utilize a LoRA-based adapter for training while retaining video diffusion model prior knowledge. A custom dataset, MultiCam-WarpData, is created to support the approach.

Result: DepthDirector achieves superior performance in both camera controllability and visual quality, as validated by experiments.

Conclusion: DepthDirector successfully addresses the inpainting and subject inconsistency issues, providing a reliable framework for generating high-quality videos with precise camera movements.

Abstract: Camera control has been extensively studied in conditioned video generation; however, performing precisely altering the camera trajectories while faithfully preserving the video content remains a challenging task. The mainstream approach to achieving precise camera control is warping a 3D representation according to the target trajectory. However, such methods fail to fully leverage the 3D priors of video diffusion models (VDMs) and often fall into the Inpainting Trap, resulting in subject inconsistency and degraded generation quality. To address this problem, we propose DepthDirector, a video re-rendering framework with precise camera controllability. By leveraging the depth video from explicit 3D representation as camera-control guidance, our method can faithfully reproduce the dynamic scene of an input video under novel camera trajectories. Specifically, we design a View-Content Dual-Stream Condition mechanism that injects both the source video and the warped depth sequence rendered under the target viewpoint into the pretrained video generation model. This geometric guidance signal enables VDMs to comprehend camera movements and leverage their 3D understanding capabilities, thereby facilitating precise camera control and consistent content generation. Next, we introduce a lightweight LoRA-based video diffusion adapter to train our framework, fully preserving the knowledge priors of VDMs. Additionally, we construct a large-scale multi-camera synchronized dataset named MultiCam-WarpData using Unreal Engine 5, containing 8K videos across 1K dynamic scenes. Extensive experiments show that DepthDirector outperforms existing methods in both camera controllability and visual quality. Our code and dataset will be publicly available.

*Megha Mariam K M,C. V. Jawahar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to automatically identify and highlight relevant regions of presentation slides based on the speaker's narrative, aiding comprehension and reducing cognitive strain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the disconnect between spoken content and slide elements in educational and content-heavy presentations, ensuring audiences effectively process information.

Method: The method analyzes spoken content and matches it to textual or graphical elements in slides, automatically highlighting regions for synchronization and better comprehension.

Result: Different solutions were explored, and the paper discusses their successes and limitations in analyzing multimedia presentations for enhanced understanding.

Conclusion: Synchronizing spoken narratives with relevant slide regions improves comprehension and reduces cognitive strain in presentations. It holds promise for applications like educational videos and conference talks.

Abstract: Imagine sitting in a presentation, trying to follow the speaker while simultaneously scanning the slides for relevant information. While the entire slide is visible, identifying the relevant regions can be challenging. As you focus on one part of the slide, the speaker moves on to a new sentence, leaving you scrambling to catch up visually. This constant back-and-forth creates a disconnect between what is being said and the most important visual elements, making it hard to absorb key details, especially in fast-paced or content-heavy presentations such as conference talks. This requires an understanding of slides, including text, graphics, and layout. We introduce a method that automatically identifies and highlights the most relevant slide regions based on the speaker's narrative. By analyzing spoken content and matching it with textual or graphical elements in the slides, our approach ensures better synchronization between what listeners hear and what they need to attend to. We explore different ways of solving this problem and assess their success and failure cases. Analyzing multimedia documents is emerging as a key requirement for seamless understanding of content-rich videos, such as educational videos and conference talks, by reducing cognitive strain and improving comprehension.

TL;DR: This paper introduces DanQing, a high-quality Chinese vision-language dataset of 100 million image-text pairs, aimed at addressing the lack of Chinese VLP datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the shortage of high-quality Chinese image-text datasets, which has hindered advancements in Chinese vision-language pretraining when compared to English datasets.

Method: The authors developed a pipeline to construct a rigorous, high-quality Chinese image-text dataset (DanQing) from Common Crawl data, focusing on semantic trends and superior data filtering.

Result: DanQing outperforms existing datasets in downstream tasks like zero-shot classification, cross-modal retrieval, and other evaluations, as demonstrated by experiments using the SigLIP2 model.

Conclusion: DanQing offers higher-quality data and practical utility for Chinese VLP research, and it is made open-source to support further advancements in the field.

Abstract: Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models demonstrate strong performance across various downstream tasks by learning from large-scale image-text pairs through contrastive pretraining. The release of extensive English image-text datasets (e.g., COYO-700M and LAION-400M) has enabled widespread adoption of models such as CLIP and SigLIP in tasks including cross-modal retrieval and image captioning. However, the advancement of Chinese vision-language pretraining has substantially lagged behind, due to the scarcity of high-quality Chinese image-text data. To address this gap, we develop a comprehensive pipeline for constructing a high-quality Chinese cross-modal dataset. As a result, we propose DanQing, which contains 100 million image-text pairs collected from Common Crawl. Different from existing datasets, DanQing is curated through a more rigorous selection process, yielding superior data quality. Moreover, DanQing is primarily built from 2024-2025 web data, enabling models to better capture evolving semantic trends and thus offering greater practical utility. We compare DanQing with existing datasets by continual pre-training of the SigLIP2 model. Experimental results show that DanQing consistently achieves superior performance across a range of Chinese downstream tasks, including zero-shot classification, cross-modal retrieval, and LMM-based evaluations. To facilitate further research in Chinese vision-language pre-training, we will open-source the DanQing dataset under the Creative Common CC-BY 4.0 license.

*Peng-Fei Zhang,Zi Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Hierarchical Refinement Attack (HRA), a universal adversarial attack for Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models, which is scalable and effective across image and text modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial attacks are computationally expensive when applied to large datasets or new scenarios. The paper aims to create a more efficient and universal attack method for VLP models.

Method: The authors propose HRA, which refines universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs) at sample and optimization levels. Key strategies include disentangling adversarial components in images, introducing ScMix augmentation for diversified visual contexts, refining optimization paths using hierarchical gradient information, and using globally influential words for text perturbations.

Result: Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and superiority of HRA across various tasks, models, and datasets.

Conclusion: HRA presents a scalable and superior approach to multimodal universal adversarial attacks, advancing the disruption of VLP models with efficient, context-aware perturbations.

Abstract: Existing adversarial attacks for VLP models are mostly sample-specific, resulting in substantial computational overhead when scaled to large datasets or new scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we propose Hierarchical Refinement Attack (HRA), a multimodal universal attack framework for VLP models. HRA refines universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs) at both the sample level and the optimization level. For the image modality, we disentangle adversarial examples into clean images and perturbations, allowing each component to be handled independently for more effective disruption of cross-modal alignment. We further introduce a ScMix augmentation strategy that diversifies visual contexts and strengthens both global and local utility of UAPs, thereby reducing reliance on spurious features. In addition, we refine the optimization path by leveraging a temporal hierarchy of historical and estimated future gradients to avoid local minima and stabilize universal perturbation learning. For the text modality, HRA identifies globally influential words by combining intra-sentence and inter-sentence importance measures, and subsequently utilizes these words as universal text perturbations. Extensive experiments across various downstream tasks, VLP models, and datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed universal multimodal attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome disjointed capabilities in existing models, including incomplete modality support and lack of proactive monitoring in streaming scenarios.

Method: ROMA integrates synchronized audio and video inputs, employs a lightweight 'speak head' for precise response initiation, and is trained on a curated streaming dataset with a two-stage curriculum for better adaptation to streaming formats.

Result: ROMA achieves state-of-the-art performance in proactive tasks and competitive results in reactive tasks across 12 standardized benchmarks, showcasing its robustness.

Conclusion: ROMA demonstrates efficacy in unified, real-time audio-video-text understanding and sets a new standard for proactive and reactive multimodal tasks.

Abstract: Recent Omni-multimodal Large Language Models show promise in unified audio, vision, and text modeling. However, streaming audio-video understanding remains challenging, as existing approaches suffer from disjointed capabilities: they typically exhibit incomplete modality support or lack autonomous proactive monitoring. To address this, we present ROMA, a real-time omni-multimodal assistant for unified reactive and proactive interaction. ROMA processes continuous inputs as synchronized multimodal units, aligning dense audio with discrete video frames to handle granularity mismatches. For online decision-making, we introduce a lightweight speak head that decouples response initiation from generation to ensure precise triggering without task conflict. We train ROMA with a curated streaming dataset and a two-stage curriculum that progressively optimizes for streaming format adaptation and proactive responsiveness. To standardize the fragmented evaluation landscape, we reorganize diverse benchmarks into a unified suite covering both proactive (alert, narration) and reactive (QA) settings. Extensive experiments across 12 benchmarks demonstrate ROMA achieves state-of-the-art performance on proactive tasks while competitive in reactive settings, validating its robustness in unified real-time omni-multimodal understanding.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel method, SRAW, to generate adversarial attacks on SAR imagery systems, ensuring stealthiness and effectiveness. It significantly impacts SAR-ATR models compared to current approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SAR-ATR systems over-rely on background information and are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which demand an effective and stealthy method to tackle these limitations.

Method: The authors propose Space-Reweighted Adversarial Warping (SRAW), leveraging optimized spatial deformation with reweighted budgets for foreground and background regions to create adversarial examples.

Result: Experiments show SRAW degrades SAR-ATR model performance, surpasses existing attack methods in imperceptibility, and ensures adversarial transferability.

Conclusion: SRAW is a powerful and stealthy adversarial attack method, addressing limitations in SAR-ATR systems and advancing adversarial robustness research.

Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery exhibits intrinsic information sparsity due to its unique electromagnetic scattering mechanism. Despite the widespread adoption of deep neural network (DNN)-based SAR automatic target recognition (SAR-ATR) systems, they remain vulnerable to adversarial examples and tend to over-rely on background regions, leading to degraded adversarial robustness. Existing adversarial attacks for SAR-ATR often require visually perceptible distortions to achieve effective performance, thereby necessitating an attack method that balances effectiveness and stealthiness. In this paper, a novel attack method termed Space-Reweighted Adversarial Warping (SRAW) is proposed, which generates adversarial examples through optimized spatial deformation with reweighted budgets across foreground and background regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SRAW significantly degrades the performance of state-of-the-art SAR-ATR models and consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of imperceptibility and adversarial transferability.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the think-then-generate paradigm for text-to-image diffusion models, enhancing reasoning and rewriting capabilities in prompt-to-image generation for improved semantic and visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most text-to-image diffusion models only map textual prompts to pixels without utilizing reasoning capabilities, limiting the generation of contextually and factually consistent images.

Method: The think-then-generate paradigm fine-tunes large language models to rewrite prompts using reasoning, combined with co-optimization of text encoders and diffusion models through image-grounded rewards and techniques like Dual-GRPO.

Result: The proposed method shows improved factual consistency, semantic alignment, and visual realism in generated images, achieving a competitive WISE score of 0.79.

Conclusion: The think-then-generate paradigm advances text-to-image diffusion by integrating reasoning capabilities, marking progress toward unified models with reasoning, expression, and demonstration.

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models (DMs) has enabled high-quality visual synthesis from diverse textual prompts. Yet, most existing T2I DMs, even those equipped with large language model (LLM)-based text encoders, remain text-pixel mappers -- they employ LLMs merely as text encoders, without leveraging their inherent reasoning capabilities to infer what should be visually depicted given the textual prompt. To move beyond such literal generation, we propose the think-then-generate (T2G) paradigm, where the LLM-based text encoder is encouraged to reason about and rewrite raw user prompts; the states of the rewritten prompts then serve as diffusion conditioning. To achieve this, we first activate the think-then-rewrite pattern of the LLM encoder with a lightweight supervised fine-tuning process. Subsequently, the LLM encoder and diffusion backbone are co-optimized to ensure faithful reasoning about the context and accurate rendering of the semantics via Dual-GRPO. In particular, the text encoder is reinforced using image-grounded rewards to infer and recall world knowledge, while the diffusion backbone is pushed to produce semantically consistent and visually coherent images. Experiments show substantial improvements in factual consistency, semantic alignment, and visual realism across reasoning-based image generation and editing benchmarks, achieving 0.79 on WISE score, nearly on par with GPT-4. Our results constitute a promising step toward next-generation unified models with reasoning, expression, and demonstration capacities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised CNNs achieve advanced performance in imaging inverse problems but lack theoretical understanding, often seen as black-box models.

Method: Analyzed trained CNNs using the MMSE estimator while incorporating translation equivariance and locality constraints, leading to a LE-MMSE framework.

Result: Derived interpretable formulas and matched numerical outputs across tasks, datasets, and architectures. Explored various influences like dataset size and estimator types.

Conclusion: The framework advances CNN theoretical understanding, aligns with practical performance, and guides imaging problem approaches via transferable insights.

Abstract: Supervised convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely used to solve imaging inverse problems, achieving state-of-the-art performance in numerous applications. However, despite their empirical success, these methods are poorly understood from a theoretical perspective and often treated as black boxes. To bridge this gap, we analyze trained neural networks through the lens of the Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) estimator, incorporating functional constraints that capture two fundamental inductive biases of CNNs: translation equivariance and locality via finite receptive fields. Under the empirical training distribution, we derive an analytic, interpretable, and tractable formula for this constrained variant, termed Local-Equivariant MMSE (LE-MMSE). Through extensive numerical experiments across various inverse problems (denoising, inpainting, deconvolution), datasets (FFHQ, CIFAR-10, FashionMNIST), and architectures (U-Net, ResNet, PatchMLP), we demonstrate that our theory matches the neural networks outputs (PSNR $\gtrsim25$dB). Furthermore, we provide insights into the differences between \emph{physics-aware} and \emph{physics-agnostic} estimators, the impact of high-density regions in the training (patch) distribution, and the influence of other factors (dataset size, patch size, etc).

Result: The proposed framework significantly improves performance in authenticity detection and multi-dimensional quality regression.

Conclusion: The research bridges forensic detection and quality assessment gaps, offering a robust tool for evaluating human pose editing models.

Abstract: Text-guided human pose editing has gained significant traction in AIGC applications. However,it remains plagued by structural anomalies and generative artifacts. Existing evaluation metrics often isolate authenticity detection from quality assessment, failing to provide fine-grained insights into pose-specific inconsistencies. To address these limitations, we introduce HPE-Bench, a specialized benchmark comprising 1,700 standardized samples from 17 state-of-the-art editing models, offering both authenticity labels and multi-dimensional quality scores. Furthermore, we propose a unified framework based on layer-selective multimodal large language models (MLLMs). By employing contrastive LoRA tuning and a novel layer sensitivity analysis (LSA) mechanism, we identify the optimal feature layer for pose evaluation. Our framework achieves superior performance in both authenticity detection and multi-dimensional quality regression, effectively bridging the gap between forensic detection and quality assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based image compression methods are slow and suboptimal due to fragmented training and less efficient bit allocation.

Method: Introduces DiffCR with a Frequency-aware Skip Estimation (FaSE) module to refine priors, Frequency Decoupling Attention (FDA) for alignment, and a lightweight consistency estimator for faster two-step decoding.

Result: Achieves significant bitrate reduction (27.2% BD-rate for LPIPS, 65.1% for PSNR) and a speed-up of over 10× compared to SOTA diffusion-based methods.

Conclusion: DiffCR establishes a novel framework for efficient image compression, outperforming standard approaches in both speed and performance without requiring updates to the core diffusion model.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion-based generative priors have enabled visually plausible image compression at extremely low bit rates. However, existing approaches suffer from slow sampling processes and suboptimal bit allocation due to fragmented training paradigms. In this work, we propose Accelerate \textbf{Diff}usion-based Image Compression via \textbf{C}onsistency Prior \textbf{R}efinement (DiffCR), a novel compression framework for efficient and high-fidelity image reconstruction. At the heart of DiffCR is a Frequency-aware Skip Estimation (FaSE) module that refines the $ε$-prediction prior from a pre-trained latent diffusion model and aligns it with compressed latents at different timesteps via Frequency Decoupling Attention (FDA). Furthermore, a lightweight consistency estimator enables fast \textbf{two-step decoding} by preserving the semantic trajectory of diffusion sampling. Without updating the backbone diffusion model, DiffCR achieves substantial bitrate savings (27.2\% BD-rate (LPIPS) and 65.1\% BD-rate (PSNR)) and over $10\times$ speed-up compared to SOTA diffusion-based compression baselines.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in previous works rendering Transformer's input into images and alleviate computational and memory costs during token-by-token inference.

Method: VIST2 interleaves visual encodings and text chunks, relying exclusively on visual tokens during pre-context for next-token prediction. It involves stages of curriculum-scheduled pretraining for optical language modeling followed by modal-interleaved instruction tuning.

Result: VIST2 achieves a 4x compression ratio, 3x speedup in first-token generation, 77% memory reduction, and 74% reduction in FLOPS with scaled models ranging from 0.6B to 8B.

Conclusion: VIST2 demonstrates the potential of leveraging visual encoding in transformers for efficient OCR tasks and long writing tasks, with significant computation and memory savings.

Abstract: Recent achievements of vision-language models in end-to-end OCR point to a new avenue for low-loss compression of textual information. This motivates earlier works that render the Transformer's input into images for prefilling, which effectively reduces the number of tokens through visual encoding, thereby alleviating the quadratically increased Attention computations. However, this partial compression fails to save computational or memory costs at token-by-token inference. In this paper, we investigate global context compression, which saves tokens at both prefilling and inference stages. Consequently, we propose VIST2, a novel Transformer that interleaves input text chunks alongside their visual encoding, while depending exclusively on visual tokens in the pre-context to predict the next text token distribution. Around this idea, we render text chunks into sketch images and train VIST2 in multiple stages, starting from curriculum-scheduled pretraining for optical language modeling, followed by modal-interleaved instruction tuning. We conduct extensive experiments using VIST2 families scaled from 0.6B to 8B to explore the training recipe and hyperparameters. With a 4$\times$ compression ratio, the resulting models demonstrate significant superiority over baselines on long writing tasks, achieving, on average, a 3$\times$ speedup in first-token generation, 77% reduction in memory usage, and 74% reduction in FLOPS. Our codes and datasets will be public to support further studies.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a survival prediction framework for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) using missing-aware multimodal data integration, showcasing strong prediction accuracy and robustness to incomplete data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenge of small cohort sizes and missing data in NSCLC survival prediction by developing a robust, clinically applicable multimodal framework.

Method: The framework integrates CT, whole-slide histopathology (WSI) images, and clinical data. It uses foundation models for feature extraction and a missing-aware encoding strategy to achieve intermediate multimodal fusion.

Result: The approach outperforms unimodal and other fusion strategies, achieving a 73.30 C-index with WSI and clinical data fusion and demonstrating resilience to missing data.

Conclusion: The methodology effectively handles incomplete modalities, ensuring robustness and adaptability in NSCLC survival prediction, advancing the potential for clinical applications.

Abstract: Accurate survival prediction in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) requires the integration of heterogeneous clinical, radiological, and histopathological information. While Multimodal Deep Learning (MDL) offers a promises for precision prognosis and survival prediction, its clinical applicability is severely limited by small cohort sizes and the presence of missing modalities, often forcing complete-case filtering or aggressive imputation. In this work, we present a missing-aware multimodal survival framework that integrates Computed Tomography (CT), Whole-Slide Histopathology (WSI) Images, and structured clinical variables for overall survival modeling in unresectable stage II-III NSCLC. By leveraging Foundation Models (FM) for modality-specific feature extraction and a missing-aware encoding strategy, the proposed approach enables intermediate multimodal fusion under naturally incomplete modality profiles. The proposed architecture is resilient to missing modalities by design, allowing the model to utilize all available data without being forced to drop patients during training or inference. Experimental results demonstrate that intermediate fusion consistently outperforms unimodal baselines as well as early and late fusion strategies, with the strongest performance achieved by the fusion of WSI and clinical modalities (73.30 C-index). Further analyses of modality importance reveal an adaptive behavior in which less informative modalities, i.e., CT modality, are automatically down-weighted and contribute less to the final survival prediction.

Conclusion: This framework is effective for generating high-quality composite images and is broadly applicable to other imaging domains requiring multi-temporal image fusion, aiding annotation and segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Fluorescence microscopy is widely employed for the analysis of living biological samples; however, the utility of the resulting recordings is frequently constrained by noise, temporal variability, and inconsistent visualisation of signals that oscillate over time. We present a unique computational framework that integrates information from multiple time-resolved frames into a single high-quality image, while preserving the underlying biological content of the original video. We evaluate the proposed method through an extensive number of configurations (n = 111) and on a challenging dataset comprising dynamic, heterogeneous, and morphologically complex 2D monolayers of cardiac cells. Results show that our framework, which consists of a combination of explainable techniques from different computer vision application fields, is capable of generating composite images that preserve and enhance the quality and information of individual microscopy frames, yielding 44% average increase in cell count compared to previous methods. The proposed pipeline is applicable to other imaging domains that require the fusion of multi-temporal image stacks into high-quality 2D images, thereby facilitating annotation and downstream segmentation.

*Clementine Grethen,Nicolas Menga,Roland Brochard,Geraldine Morin,Simone Gasparini,Jeremy Lebreton,Manuel Sanchez Gestido*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Lunar-G2R, a framework to estimate spatially varying reflectance using only lunar terrain geometry, enabling more realistic rendering and navigation without needing additional multi-view or hardware data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the limitations of current lunar rendering pipelines that rely on simplified BRDF models unable to capture local reflectance variations, thus affecting photometric realism in planetary rendering and vision-based navigation.

Method: Lunar-G2R uses a U-Net and differentiable rendering technique trained to reduce discrepancies between real images and physically-based renderings under certain geometries without the need for additional control imagery or hardware.

Result: The method demonstrated a 38% reduction in photometric error compared to the baseline, improved PSNR, SSIM, and perceptual similarity, and captured fine-scale reflectance variations more effectively.

Conclusion: The proposed method is the first to infer spatially varying reflectance directly from terrain geometry and marks a significant improvement in photometric realism for lunar surface rendering and navigation tasks.

Abstract: We address the problem of estimating realistic, spatially varying reflectance for complex planetary surfaces such as the lunar regolith, which is critical for high-fidelity rendering and vision-based navigation. Existing lunar rendering pipelines rely on simplified or spatially uniform BRDF models whose parameters are difficult to estimate and fail to capture local reflectance variations, limiting photometric realism. We propose Lunar-G2R, a geometry-to-reflectance learning framework that predicts spatially varying BRDF parameters directly from a lunar digital elevation model (DEM), without requiring multi-view imagery, controlled illumination, or dedicated reflectance-capture hardware at inference time. The method leverages a U-Net trained with differentiable rendering to minimize photometric discrepancies between real orbital images and physically based renderings under known viewing and illumination geometry. Experiments on a geographically held-out region of the Tycho crater show that our approach reduces photometric error by 38 % compared to a state-of-the-art baseline, while achieving higher PSNR and SSIM and improved perceptual similarity, capturing fine-scale reflectance variations absent from spatially uniform models. To our knowledge, this is the first method to infer a spatially varying reflectance model directly from terrain geometry.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the SocioSeg dataset and SocioReasoner framework, enabling segmentation of socially-defined urban entities in satellite imagery using reinforcement learning and vision-language model reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Segmenting socially-defined entities in satellite imagery remains challenging but vital for applications in urban planning and monitoring.

Method: The authors created the SocioSeg dataset for hierarchical annotations of social entities and developed SocioReasoner, a vision-language reasoning framework optimized with reinforcement learning.

Result: The proposed SocioReasoner framework outperformed state-of-the-art models and demonstrated strong zero-shot generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: The combination of vision-language reasoning and reinforcement learning effectively addresses urban socio-semantic segmentation, with clear applications and resources provided for future research.

Abstract: As hubs of human activity, urban surfaces consist of a wealth of semantic entities. Segmenting these various entities from satellite imagery is crucial for a range of downstream applications. Current advanced segmentation models can reliably segment entities defined by physical attributes (e.g., buildings, water bodies) but still struggle with socially defined categories (e.g., schools, parks). In this work, we achieve socio-semantic segmentation by vision-language model reasoning. To facilitate this, we introduce the Urban Socio-Semantic Segmentation dataset named SocioSeg, a new resource comprising satellite imagery, digital maps, and pixel-level labels of social semantic entities organized in a hierarchical structure. Additionally, we propose a novel vision-language reasoning framework called SocioReasoner that simulates the human process of identifying and annotating social semantic entities via cross-modal recognition and multi-stage reasoning. We employ reinforcement learning to optimize this non-differentiable process and elicit the reasoning capabilities of the vision-language model. Experiments demonstrate our approach's gains over state-of-the-art models and strong zero-shot generalization. Our dataset and code are available in https://github.com/AMAP-ML/SocioReasoner.

*Wenqing Wang,Da Li,Xiatian Zhu,Josef Kittler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method called MERGETUNE to recover pretrained knowledge in fine-tuned vision-language models without architectural changes, achieving improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning vision-language models often causes catastrophic forgetting of pretrained knowledge, and prior solutions fail to fully prevent it. There is a need for a method to restore previously lost knowledge post adaptation.

Method: The authors propose a continued fine-tuning paradigm (CFT) using the MERGETUNE strategy based on linear mode connectivity (LMC). This approach fine-tunes parameters post hoc without requiring data replay or architectural modifications.

Result: MERGETUNE improves base-novel generalization by +5.6% and achieves superior performance in specific datasets. It also enhances robust fine-tuning evaluations, surpassing ensemble baselines with lower inference costs.

Conclusion: MERGETUNE provides an effective way to merge pretrained and fine-tuned solutions in VLMs, preserving valuable pretrained knowledge while improving overall model performance.

Abstract: Fine-tuning vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP often leads to catastrophic forgetting of pretrained knowledge. Prior work primarily aims to mitigate forgetting during adaptation; however, forgetting often remains inevitable during this process. We introduce a novel paradigm, \emph{continued fine-tuning (CFT)}, which seeks to recover pretrained knowledge after a zero-shot model has already been adapted. We propose a simple, model-agnostic CFT strategy (named MERGETUNE) guided by linear mode connectivity (LMC), which can be applied post hoc to existing fine-tuned models without requiring architectural changes. Given a fine-tuned model, we continue fine-tuning its trainable parameters (e.g., soft prompts or linear heads) to search for a continued model which has two low-loss paths to the zero-shot (e.g., CLIP) and the fine-tuned (e.g., CoOp) solutions. By exploiting the geometry of the loss landscape, the continued model implicitly merges the two solutions, restoring pretrained knowledge lost in the fine-tuned counterpart. A challenge is that the vanilla LMC constraint requires data replay from the pretraining task. We approximate this constraint for the zero-shot model via a second-order surrogate, eliminating the need for large-scale data replay. Experiments show that MERGETUNE improves the harmonic mean of CoOp by +5.6\% on base-novel generalisation without adding parameters. % We show \emph{the first time} superior performance than CLIP on both DTD and EuroSAT, on cross-dataset transfer. On robust fine-tuning evaluations, the LMC-merged model from MERGETUNE surpasses ensemble baselines with lower inference cost, achieving further gains and state-of-the-art results when ensembled with the zero-shot model.

Motivation: To address depth perception limitations and occlusions in camera-based HD map construction for autonomous vehicles.

Method: Combines satellite imagery (as a global depth prior) with multi-view camera observations to directly predict vectorized HD maps for autonomous driving modules.

Result: Achieves significant improvements in mapping accuracy: 34.8% better than camera-only methods and 8.5% better than camera-LiDAR fusion methods, demonstrated using the nuScenes dataset and tested under various challenging conditions.

Conclusion: SatMap effectively enhances HD map estimation by mitigating depth and occlusion challenges, proving to be reliable in diverse conditions, and will have publicly available source code.

Abstract: Online high-definition (HD) map construction is an essential part of a safe and robust end-to-end autonomous driving (AD) pipeline. Onboard camera-based approaches suffer from limited depth perception and degraded accuracy due to occlusion. In this work, we propose SatMap, an online vectorized HD map estimation method that integrates satellite maps with multi-view camera observations and directly predicts a vectorized HD map for downstream prediction and planning modules. Our method leverages lane-level semantics and texture from satellite imagery captured from a Bird's Eye View (BEV) perspective as a global prior, effectively mitigating depth ambiguity and occlusion. In our experiments on the nuScenes dataset, SatMap achieves 34.8% mAP performance improvement over the camera-only baseline and 8.5% mAP improvement over the camera-LiDAR fusion baseline. Moreover, we evaluate our model in long-range and adverse weather conditions to demonstrate the advantages of using a satellite prior map.

To bridge this gap, we introduce FUSE-Bike, the first fully open perception platform of its kind. Equipped with two LiDARs, a camera, and GNSS, it facilitates high-fidelity, close-range data capture directly from a cyclist's viewpoint. Leveraging this platform, we present BikeActions, a novel multi-modal dataset comprising 852 annotated samples across 5 distinct action classes, specifically tailored to improve VRU behavior modeling. We establish a rigorous benchmark by evaluating state-of-the-art graph convolution and transformer-based models on our publicly released data splits, establishing the first performance baselines for this challenging task. We release the full dataset together with data curation tools, the open hardware design, and the benchmark code to foster future research in VRU action understanding under https://iv.ee.hm.edu/bikeactions/.

Motivation: The aim is to overcome challenges in using sparse imagery for digital twinning and asset inventories, focusing on robustness, localization accuracy, and detailed state understanding.

Method: SVII-3D integrates LoRA fine-tuned detection with spatial-attention matching for better observation handling, geometry-guided mechanisms for structural precision, and a Vision-Language Model for diagnosing operational states.

Result: SVII-3D achieves significant improvements in identification accuracy and minimizes localization errors in infrastructure digitization.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a scalable, cost-effective, and holistic solution for digital twin creation and infrastructure management in smart cities.

Abstract: The automated creation of digital twins and precise asset inventories is a critical task in smart city construction and facility lifecycle management. However, utilizing cost-effective sparse imagery remains challenging due to limited robustness, inaccurate localization, and a lack of fine-grained state understanding. To address these limitations, SVII-3D, a unified framework for holistic asset digitization, is proposed. First, LoRA fine-tuned open-set detection is fused with a spatial-attention matching network to robustly associate observations across sparse views. Second, a geometry-guided refinement mechanism is introduced to resolve structural errors, achieving precise decimeter-level 3D localization. Third, transcending static geometric mapping, a Vision-Language Model agent leveraging multi-modal prompting is incorporated to automatically diagnose fine-grained operational states. Experiments demonstrate that SVII-3D significantly improves identification accuracy and minimizes localization errors. Consequently, this framework offers a scalable, cost-effective solution for high-fidelity infrastructure digitization, effectively bridging the gap between sparse perception and automated intelligent maintenance.

TL;DR: This paper investigates using two deep learning models (FFA-Net and AECR-Net) to enhance visibility in analog gauge images affected by smoke and haze, employing a synthetic dataset for training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of diminished visibility in smoky and hazy environments, which hampers emergency services and infrastructure monitoring by improving readability of gauge images for first responders.

Method: Two deep learning architectures, FFA-Net and AECR-Net, were employed on a newly created synthetic dataset containing over 14,000 images generated using Unreal Engine, trained with an 80-10-10 train-validation-test split.

Result: For synthetic haze datasets, high performance was achieved with SSIM=0.98 and PSNR=43 dB, with AECR-Net delivering better results than FFA-Net. Results for synthetic smoke datasets were lower due to higher complexity.

Conclusion: Deep learning enhances the readability of analog gauge images in haze and smoke environments and shows promising results, although additional optimization may be required for smoke scenarios.

Abstract: Images captured in hazy and smoky environments suffer from reduced visibility, posing a challenge when monitoring infrastructures and hindering emergency services during critical situations. The proposed work investigates the use of the deep learning models to enhance the automatic, machine-based readability of gauge in smoky environments, with accurate gauge data interpretation serving as a valuable tool for first responders. The study utilizes two deep learning architectures, FFA-Net and AECR-Net, to improve the visibility of gauge images, corrupted with light up to dense haze and smoke. Since benchmark datasets of analog gauge images are unavailable, a new synthetic dataset, containing over 14,000 images, was generated using the Unreal Engine. The models were trained with an 80\% train, 10\% validation, and 10\% test split for the haze and smoke dataset, respectively. For the synthetic haze dataset, the SSIM and PSNR metrics are about 0.98 and 43\,dB, respectively, comparing well to state-of-the art results. Additionally, more robust results are retrieved from the AECR-Net, when compared to the FFA-Net. Although the results from the synthetic smoke dataset are poorer, the trained models achieve interesting results. In general, imaging in the presence of smoke are more difficult to enhance given the inhomogeneity and high density. Secondly, FFA-Net and AECR-Net are implemented to dehaze and not to desmoke images. This work shows that use of deep learning architectures can improve the quality of analog gauge images captured in smoke and haze scenes immensely. Finally, the enhanced output images can be successfully post-processed for automatic autonomous reading of gauges

TL;DR: The paper presents a domain-adapted framework for enhancing Large Vision Language Models (VLMs) to intelligently analyze urban roadside infrastructure, achieving superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work was motivated by the challenge that general-purpose models often fail to capture fine-grained attributes and adhere to domain-specific engineering rules, which are vital for smart city management.

Method: The framework integrates data-efficient fine-tuning, knowledge-grounded reasoning, and a dual-modality Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module to improve asset localization and attribute reasoning.

Result: The proposed model achieved 58.9 mAP for detection and 95.5% accuracy for attribute recognition on a new urban roadside dataset.

Conclusion: The framework provides a reliable and effective solution for the complex task of urban roadside infrastructure monitoring, adapting VLMs with domain-specific optimizations.

Abstract: Automated perception of urban roadside infrastructure is crucial for smart city management, yet general-purpose models often struggle to capture the necessary fine-grained attributes and domain rules. While Large Vision Language Models (VLMs) excel at open-world recognition, they often struggle to accurately interpret complex facility states in compliance with engineering standards, leading to unreliable performance in real-world applications. To address this, we propose a domain-adapted framework that transforms VLMs into specialized agents for intelligent infrastructure analysis. Our approach integrates a data-efficient fine-tuning strategy with a knowledge-grounded reasoning mechanism. Specifically, we leverage open-vocabulary fine-tuning on Grounding DINO to robustly localize diverse assets with minimal supervision, followed by LoRA-based adaptation on Qwen-VL for deep semantic attribute reasoning. To mitigate hallucinations and enforce professional compliance, we introduce a dual-modality Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module that dynamically retrieves authoritative industry standards and visual exemplars during inference. Evaluated on a comprehensive new dataset of urban roadside scenes, our framework achieves a detection performance of 58.9 mAP and an attribute recognition accuracy of 95.5%, demonstrating a robust solution for intelligent infrastructure monitoring.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of physics-incoherent video generation by using latent world models as rewards during inference, significantly improving physics plausibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art video generative models often fail to respect fundamental physics principles, which reduces their real-world applicability. The paper seeks to address this gap by diagnosing the deficiency as not only stemming from inadequate pre-training but also from suboptimal inference strategies.

Method: The authors present WMReward, which uses a latent world model (VJEPA-2) to provide physics-based rewards during inference. By steering multiple denoising trajectories at test time, the method improves video generation output's adherence to physics principles.

Result: This method significantly enhances physics plausibility across various conditions (image-conditioned, multi-frame-conditioned, and text-conditioned generation). It achieved a top score of 62.64% in the ICCV 2025 Perception Test PhysicsIQ Challenge, surpassing the prior state-of-the-art by 7.42%.

Conclusion: Using latent world models as inference-time alignments is effective for improving the physics plausibility of video generation, setting a new benchmark and demonstrating future potential beyond this specific implementation.

Abstract: State-of-the-art video generative models produce promising visual content yet often violate basic physics principles, limiting their utility. While some attribute this deficiency to insufficient physics understanding from pre-training, we find that the shortfall in physics plausibility also stems from suboptimal inference strategies. We therefore introduce WMReward and treat improving physics plausibility of video generation as an inference-time alignment problem. In particular, we leverage the strong physics prior of a latent world model (here, VJEPA-2) as a reward to search and steer multiple candidate denoising trajectories, enabling scaling test-time compute for better generation performance. Empirically, our approach substantially improves physics plausibility across image-conditioned, multiframe-conditioned, and text-conditioned generation settings, with validation from human preference study. Notably, in the ICCV 2025 Perception Test PhysicsIQ Challenge, we achieve a final score of 62.64%, winning first place and outperforming the previous state of the art by 7.42%. Our work demonstrates the viability of using latent world models to improve physics plausibility of video generation, beyond this specific instantiation or parameterization.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for autonomous driving lack datasets with dense traffic scenarios, limiting understanding of complex road user interactions.

Method: Developed the DeepUrban dataset using drone technology, capturing 3D traffic objects and urban intersection scenes at 100-meter altitude, combined with comprehensive map and scene data.

Result: Including DeepUrban in benchmarks like nuScenes improves vehicle prediction and planning accuracy, with up to 44.1%/44.3% gains in ADE/FDE metrics.

Conclusion: DeepUrban significantly enhances the ability of models to predict and plan in challenging urban traffic scenarios, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks.

Abstract: The efficacy of autonomous driving systems hinges critically on robust prediction and planning capabilities. However, current benchmarks are impeded by a notable scarcity of scenarios featuring dense traffic, which is essential for understanding and modeling complex interactions among road users. To address this gap, we collaborated with our industrial partner, DeepScenario, to develop DeepUrban-a new drone dataset designed to enhance trajectory prediction and planning benchmarks focusing on dense urban settings. DeepUrban provides a rich collection of 3D traffic objects, extracted from high-resolution images captured over urban intersections at approximately 100 meters altitude. The dataset is further enriched with comprehensive map and scene information to support advanced modeling and simulation tasks. We evaluate state-of-the-art (SOTA) prediction and planning methods, and conducted experiments on generalization capabilities. Our findings demonstrate that adding DeepUrban to nuScenes can boost the accuracy of vehicle predictions and planning, achieving improvements up to 44.1 % / 44.3% on the ADE / FDE metrics.

*Serena Grazia De Benedictis,Amedeo Altavilla,Nicoletta Del Buono*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel topology-aware evaluation framework for image segmentation, grounded in the Jordan Curve Theorem and homology theory, to overcome the limitations of conventional metrics in assessing structural and topological coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation metrics for image segmentation often fail to accurately capture structural and topological coherence, leading to inaccuracies in practical scenarios requiring topological correctness, such as medical imaging and object delineation.

Method: The authors introduce the concept of 'Jordan-segmentatable masks,' leveraging digital topology and homology theory. A novel framework validates segmentation masks using Betti numbers and ensures they partition images into meaningful regions while preserving topological properties.

Result: The proposed approach provides an unsupervised, mathematically rigorous criterion for assessing segmentation mask coherence, offering an effective alternative to standard evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: The framework enhances segmentation evaluation by prioritizing topological correctness, making it especially valuable for applications where structural coherence and object connectivity are critical.

Abstract: Image segmentation plays a central role in computer vision. However, widely used evaluation metrics, whether pixel-wise, region-based, or boundary-focused, often struggle to capture the structural and topological coherence of a segmentation. In many practical scenarios, such as medical imaging or object delineation, small inaccuracies in boundary, holes, or fragmented predictions can result in high metric scores, despite the fact that the resulting masks fail to preserve the object global shape or connectivity. This highlights a limitation of conventional metrics: they are unable to assess whether a predicted segmentation partitions the image into meaningful interior and exterior regions.
  In this work, we introduce a topology-aware notion of segmentation based on the Jordan Curve Theorem, and adapted for use in digital planes. We define the concept of a \emph{Jordan-segmentatable mask}, which is a binary segmentation whose structure ensures a topological separation of the image domain into two connected components. We analyze segmentation masks through the lens of digital topology and homology theory, extracting a $4$-curve candidate from the mask, verifying its topological validity using Betti numbers. A mask is considered Jordan-segmentatable when this candidate forms a digital 4-curve with $β_0 = β_1 = 1$, or equivalently when its complement splits into exactly two $8$-connected components.
  This framework provides a mathematically rigorous, unsupervised criterion with which to assess the structural coherence of segmentation masks. By combining digital Jordan theory and homological invariants, our approach provides a valuable alternative to standard evaluation metrics, especially in applications where topological correctness must be preserved.

Conclusion: The SHAP attack highlights a critical security risk in computer vision models, urging the need for robust defense mechanisms.

Abstract: The paper introduces a white-box attack on computer vision models using SHAP values. It demonstrates how adversarial evasion attacks can compromise the performance of deep learning models by reducing output confidence or inducing misclassifications. Such attacks are particularly insidious as they can deceive the perception of an algorithm while eluding human perception due to their imperceptibility to the human eye. The proposed attack leverages SHAP values to quantify the significance of individual inputs to the output at the inference stage. A comparison is drawn between the SHAP attack and the well-known Fast Gradient Sign Method. We find evidence that SHAP attacks are more robust in generating misclassifications particularly in gradient hiding scenarios.

Abstract: Inferring physical actions from visual observations is a fundamental capability for advancing machine intelligence in the physical world. Achieving this requires large-scale, open-vocabulary video action datasets that span broad domains. We introduce Action100M, a large-scale dataset constructed from 1.2M Internet instructional videos (14.6 years of duration), yielding O(100 million) temporally localized segments with open-vocabulary action supervision and rich captions. Action100M is generated by a fully automated pipeline that (i) performs hierarchical temporal segmentation using V-JEPA 2 embeddings, (ii) produces multi-level frame and segment captions organized as a Tree-of-Captions, and (iii) aggregates evidence with a reasoning model (GPT-OSS-120B) under a multi-round Self-Refine procedure to output structured annotations (brief/detailed action, actor, brief/detailed caption). Training VL-JEPA on Action100M demonstrates consistent data-scaling improvements and strong zero-shot performance across diverse action recognition benchmarks, establishing Action100M as a new foundation for scalable research in video understanding and world modeling.

### [195] [RSATalker: Realistic Socially-Aware Talking Head Generation for Multi-Turn Conversation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10606)
*Peng Chen,Xiaobao Wei,Yi Yang,Naiming Yao,Hui Chen,Feng Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RSATalker, a framework leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting for efficient, realistic, and socially-aware talking head generation during multi-turn conversations, addressing previous limitations in realism and computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve talking head generation for VR, particularly for social scenarios. Existing methods either lack realistic textures (3D approaches) or are computationally intense (2D approaches), and none adequately address social dynamics.

Method: RSATalker combines 3D mesh-based methods with 3D Gaussian Splatting for rendering 2D avatar videos. It includes a socially-aware module to encode different interpersonal dynamics into high-level embeddings via a learnable query mechanism. A three-stage training paradigm and a novel dataset are employed.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art realism and social awareness in talking head generation, evidenced by extensive experimentation.

Conclusion: RSATalker advances talking head generation by achieving efficient, realistic, and socially dynamic results, filling gaps in existing methods. The framework and dataset will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Talking head generation is increasingly important in virtual reality (VR), especially for social scenarios involving multi-turn conversation. Existing approaches face notable limitations: mesh-based 3D methods can model dual-person dialogue but lack realistic textures, while large-model-based 2D methods produce natural appearances but incur prohibitive computational costs. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based methods achieve efficient and realistic rendering but remain speaker-only and ignore social relationships. We introduce RSATalker, the first framework that leverages 3DGS for realistic and socially-aware talking head generation with support for multi-turn conversation. Our method first drives mesh-based 3D facial motion from speech, then binds 3D Gaussians to mesh facets to render high-fidelity 2D avatar videos. To capture interpersonal dynamics, we propose a socially-aware module that encodes social relationships, including blood and non-blood as well as equal and unequal, into high-level embeddings through a learnable query mechanism. We design a three-stage training paradigm and construct the RSATalker dataset with speech-mesh-image triplets annotated with social relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RSATalker achieves state-of-the-art performance in both realism and social awareness. The code and dataset will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Molmo2 introduces a new family of open-source video-language models that excel in video grounding tasks, outperforming existing open-weight and proprietary models on various benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The open-source community lacks access to truly open, high-quality VLMs for improving state-of-the-art video-language modeling, particularly with grounding capabilities. Existing models are either proprietary or depend on synthetic data from proprietary models.

Method: Molmo2 employs novel datasets, efficient data encoding and packing schemes, bi-directional attention techniques, and a token-weight strategy to train open-weight models for video-language tasks.

Result: Molmo2 achieves state-of-the-art performance for open-source models in tasks like video counting, captioning, tracking, and pointing, even surpassing some proprietary models on specific grounding tasks.

Conclusion: Molmo2 provides a significant advancement in the open-weight landscape of video-language models, expanding capabilities for both grounding and other high-level tasks critical to downstream applications.

Abstract: Today's strongest video-language models (VLMs) remain proprietary. The strongest open-weight models either rely on synthetic data from proprietary VLMs, effectively distilling from them, or do not disclose their training data or recipe. As a result, the open-source community lacks the foundations needed to improve on the state-of-the-art video (and image) language models. Crucially, many downstream applications require more than just high-level video understanding; they require grounding -- either by pointing or by tracking in pixels. Even proprietary models lack this capability. We present Molmo2, a new family of VLMs that are state-of-the-art among open-source models and demonstrate exceptional new capabilities in point-driven grounding in single image, multi-image, and video tasks. Our key contribution is a collection of 7 new video datasets and 2 multi-image datasets, including a dataset of highly detailed video captions for pre-training, a free-form video Q&A dataset for fine-tuning, a new object tracking dataset with complex queries, and an innovative new video pointing dataset, all collected without the use of closed VLMs. We also present a training recipe for this data utilizing an efficient packing and message-tree encoding scheme, and show bi-directional attention on vision tokens and a novel token-weight strategy improves performance. Our best-in-class 8B model outperforms others in the class of open weight and data models on short videos, counting, and captioning, and is competitive on long-videos. On video-grounding Molmo2 significantly outperforms existing open-weight models like Qwen3-VL (35.5 vs 29.6 accuracy on video counting) and surpasses proprietary models like Gemini 3 Pro on some tasks (38.4 vs 20.0 F1 on video pointing and 56.2 vs 41.1 J&F on video tracking).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoMoVi is a co-generation framework aligning 3D human motion and 2D video synthesis in a unified model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This study addresses the intrinsic coupling between generating 3D human motions and 2D human videos, suggesting the necessity to unify these two generation processes.

Method: The researchers designed CoMoVi, which employs dual-branch diffusion models for jointly generating 3D human motions and 2D videos through synchronized denoising loops, integrating 3D-2D cross attentions and mutual feature interaction.

Result: The CoMoVi Dataset was created, and experiments validated the effectiveness of CoMoVi in generating realistic 3D human motion and 2D video outputs.

Conclusion: Coupling 3D human motion and video generation can enhance realism and consistency, which CoMoVi achieves successfully using innovative diffusion-based techniques.

Abstract: In this paper, we find that the generation of 3D human motions and 2D human videos is intrinsically coupled. 3D motions provide the structural prior for plausibility and consistency in videos, while pre-trained video models offer strong generalization capabilities for motions, which necessitate coupling their generation processes. Based on this, we present CoMoVi, a co-generative framework that couples two video diffusion models (VDMs) to generate 3D human motions and videos synchronously within a single diffusion denoising loop. To achieve this, we first propose an effective 2D human motion representation that can inherit the powerful prior of pre-trained VDMs. Then, we design a dual-branch diffusion model to couple human motion and video generation process with mutual feature interaction and 3D-2D cross attentions. Moreover, we curate CoMoVi Dataset, a large-scale real-world human video dataset with text and motion annotations, covering diverse and challenging human motions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in both 3D human motion and video generation tasks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CURVE, a new multicultural and multilingual benchmark for video reasoning addressing biases in current western-centric data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address biases in video model evaluations caused by western-centric data and English-language dominance.

Method: Introduced CURVE, a benchmark featuring human-generated annotations from diverse cultural videos, and proposed an iterative strategy using evidence-based graphs to identify reasoning errors.

Result: State-of-the-art video models perform poorly on CURVE, struggling with cultural visual elements, showing a need for more robust models.

Conclusion: CURVE sets a new standard for evaluating video reasoning with diverse cultural context and reveals gaps in current video model capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video models have shown tremendous progress, particularly in long video understanding. However, current benchmarks predominantly feature western-centric data and English as the dominant language, introducing significant biases in evaluation. To address this, we introduce CURVE (Cultural Understanding and Reasoning in Video Evaluation), a challenging benchmark for multicultural and multilingual video reasoning. CURVE comprises high-quality, entirely human-generated annotations from diverse, region-specific cultural videos across 18 global locales. Unlike prior work that relies on automatic translations, CURVE provides complex questions, answers, and multi-step reasoning steps, all crafted in native languages. Making progress on CURVE requires a deeply situated understanding of visual cultural context. Furthermore, we leverage CURVE's reasoning traces to construct evidence-based graphs and propose a novel iterative strategy using these graphs to identify fine-grained errors in reasoning. Our evaluations reveal that SoTA Video-LLMs struggle significantly, performing substantially below human-level accuracy, with errors primarily stemming from the visual perception of cultural elements. CURVE will be publicly available under https://github.com/google-deepmind/neptune?tab=readme-ov-file\#minerva-cultural

TL;DR: The paper introduces a digitized dataset for ground beetles, enabling broader ecological analysis using AI-extracted traits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current global trait databases are biased and lack comprehensive data for invertebrate groups, like ground beetles, which are essential bioindicators of ecosystem health.

Method: The authors digitized over 13,200 carabid specimens from NEON across the US and Hawaii with high-resolution imaging and developed AI tools for automated trait extraction validated against manual measurements.

Result: The dataset achieved reliable sub-millimeter precision in trait extraction, offering enhanced access to ecological data and enabling computational studies.

Conclusion: Digitizing ground beetle specimens addresses trait database gaps, supports AI-enabled research, and contributes to biodiversity conservation and monitoring advancements.

Abstract: Despite the ecological significance of invertebrates, global trait databases remain heavily biased toward vertebrates and plants, limiting comprehensive ecological analyses of high-diversity groups like ground beetles. Ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) serve as critical bioindicators of ecosystem health, providing valuable insights into biodiversity shifts driven by environmental changes. While the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) maintains an extensive collection of carabid specimens from across the United States, these primarily exist as physical collections, restricting widespread research access and large-scale analysis. To address these gaps, we present a multimodal dataset digitizing over 13,200 NEON carabids from 30 sites spanning the continental US and Hawaii through high-resolution imaging, enabling broader access and computational analysis. The dataset includes digitally measured elytra length and width of each specimen, establishing a foundation for automated trait extraction using AI. Validated against manual measurements, our digital trait extraction achieves sub-millimeter precision, ensuring reliability for ecological and computational studies. By addressing invertebrate under-representation in trait databases, this work supports AI-driven tools for automated species identification and trait-based research, fostering advancements in biodiversity monitoring and conservation.

*Cheng Chen,Yuyu Guo,Pengpeng Zeng,Jingkuan Song,Peng Di,Hang Yu,Lianli Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Cross-Layer Injection (CLI), a framework aimed at improving vision-language models (VLMs) by dynamically connecting vision encoder layers with large language models (LLMs) to enhance multimodal understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional VLMs are limited by a static, asymmetric architecture where only the vision encoder's output links to the LLM's input, which hinders alignment with hierarchical visual knowledge and coherent reasoning.

Method: CLI employs two modules: Adaptive Multi-Projection (AMP), which aligns features from multiple vision layers, and Adaptive Gating Fusion (AGF), which allows the LLM to selectively incorporate visual information based on decoding context.

Result: The proposed CLI framework improves performance on diverse benchmarks when integrated into LLaVA-OneVision and LLaVA-1.5 models, demonstrating deeper multimodal comprehension.

Conclusion: CLI provides a scalable solution for vision-language integration by enabling dynamic, context-driven connections between visual and language components, significantly enhancing VLMs' reasoning abilities.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) create a severe visual feature bottleneck by using a crude, asymmetric connection that links only the output of the vision encoder to the input of the large language model (LLM). This static architecture fundamentally limits the ability of LLMs to achieve comprehensive alignment with hierarchical visual knowledge, compromising their capacity to accurately integrate local details with global semantics into coherent reasoning. To resolve this, we introduce Cross-Layer Injection (CLI), a novel and lightweight framework that forges a dynamic many-to-many bridge between the two modalities. CLI consists of two synergistic, parameter-efficient components: an Adaptive Multi-Projection (AMP) module that harmonizes features from diverse vision layers, and an Adaptive Gating Fusion (AGF) mechanism that empowers the LLM to selectively inject the most relevant visual information based on its real-time decoding context. We validate the effectiveness and versatility of CLI by integrating it into LLaVA-OneVision and LLaVA-1.5. Extensive experiments on 18 diverse benchmarks demonstrate significant performance improvements, establishing CLI as a scalable paradigm that unlocks deeper multimodal understanding by granting LLMs on-demand access to the full visual hierarchy.

*Tal Reiss,Daniel Winter,Matan Cohen,Alex Rav-Acha,Yael Pritch,Ariel Shamir,Yedid Hoshen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Alterbute is a diffusion-based method for editing intrinsic attributes (e.g., color, texture) of objects in images while preserving identity and scene context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of unsupervised or overly restrictive approaches in editing object attributes, which often compromise object identity or meaningful variations.

Method: The method uses a relaxed training objective with a combination of identity reference images, textual prompts, and extrinsic definitions. It introduces Visual Named Entities (VNEs) for scalable identity-preserving supervision.

Result: Alterbute shows superior performance in identity-preserving intrinsic attribute editing compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Alterbute effectively balances identity preservation and meaningful attribute variation in object editing tasks, offering scalable and improved results.

Abstract: We introduce Alterbute, a diffusion-based method for editing an object's intrinsic attributes in an image. We allow changing color, texture, material, and even the shape of an object, while preserving its perceived identity and scene context. Existing approaches either rely on unsupervised priors that often fail to preserve identity or use overly restrictive supervision that prevents meaningful intrinsic variations. Our method relies on: (i) a relaxed training objective that allows the model to change both intrinsic and extrinsic attributes conditioned on an identity reference image, a textual prompt describing the target intrinsic attributes, and a background image and object mask defining the extrinsic context. At inference, we restrict extrinsic changes by reusing the original background and object mask, thereby ensuring that only the desired intrinsic attributes are altered; (ii) Visual Named Entities (VNEs) - fine-grained visual identity categories (e.g., ''Porsche 911 Carrera'') that group objects sharing identity-defining features while allowing variation in intrinsic attributes. We use a vision-language model to automatically extract VNE labels and intrinsic attribute descriptions from a large public image dataset, enabling scalable, identity-preserving supervision. Alterbute outperforms existing methods on identity-preserving object intrinsic attribute editing.

*Xuweiyi Chen,Wentao Zhou,Zezhou Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WildRayZer introduces a self-supervised framework addressing challenges in novel view synthesis (NVS) for dynamic environments with moving objects and cameras, showing notable performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Novel view synthesis models struggle in dynamic environments since static models rely on multi-view consistency, which gets disrupted by motion leading to artifacts and instability.

Method: WildRayZer uses camera-only renders for static structures, analyzes residuals for transient regions, builds pseudo motion masks, distills motion estimators, and refines supervision for background completion.

Result: The proposed method outperforms other approaches in transient-region removal and full-frame NVS quality using a single feed-forward pass.

Conclusion: WildRayZer proves effective for dynamic NVS scenarios, and the new D-RE10K dataset further supports large-scale training and evaluation.

Abstract: We present WildRayZer, a self-supervised framework for novel view synthesis (NVS) in dynamic environments where both the camera and objects move. Dynamic content breaks the multi-view consistency that static NVS models rely on, leading to ghosting, hallucinated geometry, and unstable pose estimation. WildRayZer addresses this by performing an analysis-by-synthesis test: a camera-only static renderer explains rigid structure, and its residuals reveal transient regions. From these residuals, we construct pseudo motion masks, distill a motion estimator, and use it to mask input tokens and gate loss gradients so supervision focuses on cross-view background completion. To enable large-scale training and evaluation, we curate Dynamic RealEstate10K (D-RE10K), a real-world dataset of 15K casually captured dynamic sequences, and D-RE10K-iPhone, a paired transient and clean benchmark for sparse-view transient-aware NVS. Experiments show that WildRayZer consistently outperforms optimization-based and feed-forward baselines in both transient-region removal and full-frame NVS quality with a single feed-forward pass.

*Mridankan Mandal,Smit Sanjay Shende*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in deploying Python-based AI on edge devices, overcoming runtime inefficiencies from Python's GIL using adaptive profiling and runtime optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle performance issues emerging from Python's GIL on resource-constrained edge AI systems, ensuring efficient utilization of threads.

Method: The study uses a Blocking Ratio metric to differentiate I/O wait from GIL contention, combined with a lightweight profiling tool and adaptive runtime system.

Result: The proposed solution achieves 96.5% optimal performance and 93.9% efficiency across various edge AI workloads, outperforming existing alternatives.

Conclusion: The adaptive runtime system and beta metric improve Python's threading performance on edge AI systems, addressing GIL-related challenges effectively.

Abstract: Deploying Python based AI agents on resource-constrained edge devices presents a runtime optimization challenge: high thread counts are needed to mask I/O latency, yet Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) serializes execution. We demonstrate that naive thread-pool scaling causes a "saturation cliff": >= 20% throughput degradation at overprovisioned thread counts (N >= 512) on edge-representative configurations. We present a lightweight profiling tool and adaptive runtime system using a Blocking Ratio metric (beta) that distinguishes genuine I/O wait from GIL contention. Our library-based solution achieves 96.5% of optimal performance without manual tuning, outperforming multiprocessing (limited by ~8x memory overhead on devices with 512 MB-2 GB RAM) and asyncio (blocked by CPU-bound phases). Evaluation across seven edge AI workload profiles, including real ML inference with ONNX Runtime MobileNetV2, demonstrates 93.9% average efficiency. Comparative experiments with Python 3.13t (free threading) show that while GIL elimination enables ~4x throughput on multi-core edge devices, the saturation cliff persists on single-core devices, validating our beta metric for both GIL and no-GIL environments. This provides practical optimization for edge AI systems.

TL;DR: This paper investigates Federated Unlearning (FUL), which extends the concept of Machine Unlearning to Federated Learning (FL) systems, facilitating data deletion in compliance with regulations like RTBF. It reviews frameworks addressing challenges related to communication, resource allocation, and privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of Federated Learning addresses privacy and data locality concerns, but lacks built-in mechanisms for data deletion, increasingly demanded by regulations like the Right to be Forgotten (RTBF). This gap motivates the exploration of Federated Unlearning (FUL).

Method: The paper performs a survey, exploring FUL fundamentals, reviewing existing FUL frameworks addressing communication costs, resource allocation, and privacy/security challenges. It also discusses FUL applications in distributed networks and outlines future challenges.

Result: The survey consolidates knowledge on FUL, presents various frameworks tackling its main challenges, and highlights its practical applications in distributed systems, making it a reference point for advancements in the field.

Conclusion: By identifying key challenges and opportunities in Federated Unlearning, this survey intends to guide the development of compliant, privacy-respecting, and user-focused Federated Learning systems.

Abstract: The proliferation of connected devices and privacy-sensitive applications has accelerated the adoption of Federated Learning (FL), a decentralized paradigm that enables collaborative model training without sharing raw data. While FL addresses data locality and privacy concerns, it does not inherently support data deletion requests that are increasingly mandated by regulations such as the Right to be Forgotten (RTBF). In centralized learning, this challenge has been studied under the concept of Machine Unlearning (MU), that focuses on efficiently removing the influence of specific data samples or clients from trained models. Extending this notion to federated settings has given rise to Federated Unlearning (FUL), a new research area concerned with eliminating the contributions of individual clients or data subsets from the global FL model in a distributed and heterogeneous environment. In this survey, we first introduce the fundamentals of FUL. Then, we review the FUL frameworks that are proposed to address the three main implementation challenges, i.e., communication cost, resource allocation as well as security and privacy. Furthermore, we discuss applications of FUL in the modern distributed computer networks. We also highlight the open challenges and future research opportunities. By consolidating existing knowledge and mapping open problems, this survey aims to serve as a foundational reference for researchers and practitioners seeking to advance FL to build trustworthy, regulation-compliant and user-centric federated systems.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper addresses distributed linearly separable computation with heterogeneous data assignment across workers and aims to explore the tradeoff between computable dimension and communication cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to handle linearly separable distributed computation under heterogeneous and arbitrary data assignment, which is not controlled by the data center.

Method: The authors propose a universal computing scheme and converse bound under integer and fractional communication costs, considering arbitrary heterogeneous data assignments.

Result: The computing scheme and converse bound coincide under specific parameter settings, and extensions are developed for fractional communication costs.

Conclusion: The work provides insights into distributed computation with heterogeneous data assignments, characterizing the interplay between communication costs and task computational ability.

Abstract: Distributed linearly separable computation is a fundamental problem in large-scale distributed systems, requiring the computation of linearly separable functions over different datasets across distributed workers. This paper studies a heterogeneous distributed linearly separable computation problem, including one master and N distributed workers. The linearly separable task function involves Kc linear combinations of K messages, where each message is a function of one dataset. Distinguished from the existing homogeneous settings that assume each worker holds the same number of datasets, where the data assignment is carefully designed and controlled by the data center (e.g., the cyclic assignment), we consider a more general setting with arbitrary heterogeneous data assignment across workers, where `arbitrary' means that the data assignment is given in advance and `heterogeneous' means that the workers may hold different numbers of datasets. Our objective is to characterize the fundamental tradeoff between the computable dimension of the task function and the communication cost under arbitrary heterogeneous data assignment. Under the constraint of integer communication costs, for arbitrary heterogeneous data assignment, we propose a universal computing scheme and a universal converse bound by characterizing the structure of data assignment, where they coincide under some parameter regimes. We then extend the proposed computing scheme and converse bound to the case of fractional communication costs.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of low transaction throughput in blockchains, proposing SCRamble, a protocol to enhance block dissemination by using innovative link selection strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve blockchain transaction throughput and system security by addressing the limitations caused by network latency during block propagation.

Method: SCRamble relies on scoring neighbor peers based on block arrival time and considers network latency in its decentralized link selection strategy.

Result: SCRamble significantly reduces block dissemination time, directly impacting throughput and security of blockchain systems.

Conclusion: The proposed protocol demonstrates a novel approach to improving blockchain functioning by successfully reducing block propagation time through efficient link selection mechanisms.

Abstract: Despite being under development for over 15 years, transaction throughput remains one of the key challenges confronting blockchains, which typically has a cap of a limited number of transactions per second. A fundamental factor limiting this metric is the network latency associated with the block propagation throughout of the underlying peer-to-peer network, typically formed through random connections. Accelerating the dissemination of blocks not only improves transaction rates, but also enhances system security by reducing the probability of forks. This paper introduces SCRamble: a decentralized protocol that significantly reduces block dissemination time in blockchain networks. SCRamble's effectiveness is attributed to its innovative link selection strategy, which integrates two heuristics: a scoring mechanism that assesses block arrival times from neighboring peers, and a second heuristic that takes network latency into account.

### [207] [FaTRQ: Tiered Residual Quantization for LLM Vector Search in Far-Memory-Aware ANNS Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09985)
*Tianqi Zhang,Flavio Ponzina,Tajana Rosing*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FaTRQ, a system to improve Approximate Nearest-Neighbor Search (ANNS) by eliminating reliance on slow full-precision vector storage reads, achieving better storage and throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ANNS engines in retrieval-augmented generation applications suffer from high latency caused by the reliance on slower storage for reading full-precision vectors during refinement.

Method: FaTRQ uses tiered memory and a progressive distance estimator with tiered residual quantization. It employs compact residuals stored in far memory, and refinement stops early when a candidate is guaranteed not to be in the top-k, assisted by a custom hardware accelerator.

Result: FaTRQ achieves a 2.4× improvement in storage efficiency and up to 9× throughput enhancement compared to the state-of-the-art GPU-based ANNS systems.

Conclusion: The proposed FaTRQ system effectively reduces latency in ANNS by refining embeddings without accessing raw high-precision vectors from slow storage, combining effective memory-tiering strategies and hardware acceleration.

Abstract: Approximate Nearest-Neighbor Search (ANNS) is a key technique in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), enabling rapid identification of the most relevant high-dimensional embeddings from massive vector databases. Modern ANNS engines accelerate this process using prebuilt indexes and store compressed vector-quantized representations in fast memory. However, they still rely on a costly second-pass refinement stage that reads full-precision vectors from slower storage like SSDs. For modern text and multimodal embeddings, these reads now dominate the latency of the entire query. We propose FaTRQ, a far-memory-aware refinement system using tiered memory that eliminates the need to fetch full vectors from storage. It introduces a progressive distance estimator that refines coarse scores using compact residuals streamed from far memory. Refinement stops early once a candidate is provably outside the top-k. To support this, we propose tiered residual quantization, which encodes residuals as ternary values stored efficiently in far memory. A custom accelerator is deployed in a CXL Type-2 device to perform low-latency refinement locally. Together, FaTRQ improves the storage efficiency by 2.4$\times$ and improves the throughput by up to 9$ \times$ than SOTA GPU ANNS system.

*Sharim Khan,Paul Landes,Adam Cross,Jimeng Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the extraction of Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) through automated tools using reasoning models and traditional large language models on hospital admission data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance diagnostic systems with insights into patients' social circumstances by addressing the lack of structured data capturing Social Determinants of Health.

Method: The authors use hospital admission multi-label SDoH classification leveraging ICD-9 codes on the MIMIC-III dataset, integrating reasoning and large language models.

Result: The approach achieved a high F1 score of 89% and identified missing SDoH codes in 139 admissions.

Conclusion: Automated systems demonstrate promising performance in capturing nuanced patient information, presenting innovative tools for healthcare processing and analysis.

Abstract: Social Determinants of Health correlate with patient outcomes but are rarely captured in structured data. Recent attention has been given to automatically extracting these markers from clinical text to supplement diagnostic systems with knowledge of patients' social circumstances. Large language models demonstrate strong performance in identifying Social Determinants of Health labels from sentences. However, prediction in large admissions or longitudinal notes is challenging given long distance dependencies. In this paper, we explore hospital admission multi-label Social Determinants of Health ICD-9 code classification on the MIMIC-III dataset using reasoning models and traditional large language models. We exploit existing ICD-9 codes for prediction on admissions, which achieved an 89% F1. Our contributions include our findings, missing SDoH codes in 139 admissions, and code to reproduce the results.

*Faruk Alpay,Bilge Senturk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper establishes a connection between Transformer's self-attention mechanism and the tropical semiring, showing that it performs dynamic programming on a latent graph.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the computational geometry behind the Transformer's self-attention mechanism and provide theoretical insights into its reasoning processes.

Method: The authors prove that in the high-confidence regime ($β\to \infty$), the Transformer's softmax attention converts to tropical matrix multiplication, thus operating in the tropical semiring (max-plus algebra).

Result: Self-attention mechanism in Transformers executes a dynamic programming recurrence (Bellman-Ford path-finding) on a latent graph defined by token similarities.

Conclusion: Chain-of-thought reasoning in Transformers emerges geometrically from shortest-path or longest-path computations inherent in the self-attention mechanism.

Abstract: We prove that the Transformer self-attention mechanism in the high-confidence regime ($β\to \infty$, where $β$ is an inverse temperature) operates in the tropical semiring (max-plus algebra). In particular, we show that taking the tropical limit of the softmax attention converts it into a tropical matrix product. This reveals that the Transformer's forward pass is effectively executing a dynamic programming recurrence (specifically, a Bellman-Ford path-finding update) on a latent graph defined by token similarities. Our theoretical result provides a new geometric perspective for chain-of-thought reasoning: it emerges from an inherent shortest-path (or longest-path) algorithm being carried out within the network's computation.

*Khalid Oublal,Quentin Bouniot,Qi Gan,Stephan Clémençon,Zeynep Akata*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces TimeSAE, a framework that uses Sparse Autoencoders and causality to explain black-box models for time series data, addressing issues of sensitivity to distributional shifts in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve understanding and trust in black-box models for time series data, especially in critical domains requiring interpretability, while addressing the limitations of current methods that fail under distributional shifts.

Method: TimeSAE leverages Sparse Autoencoders and causality to create robust explanations for black-box model predictions, tested on synthetic and real-world data.

Result: TimeSAE outperforms existing approaches in generating faithful and robust explanations, according to both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Conclusion: TimeSAE demonstrates the potential of Sparse Autoencoders combined with causality for reliable time series model explanations, offering a robust approach for high-stakes scenarios.

Abstract: As black box models and pretrained models gain traction in time series applications, understanding and explaining their predictions becomes increasingly vital, especially in high-stakes domains where interpretability and trust are essential. However, most of the existing methods involve only in-distribution explanation, and do not generalize outside the training support, which requires the learning capability of generalization. In this work, we aim to provide a framework to explain black-box models for time series data through the dual lenses of Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and causality. We show that many current explanation methods are sensitive to distributional shifts, limiting their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. Building on the concept of Sparse Autoencoder, we introduce TimeSAE, a framework for black-box model explanation. We conduct extensive evaluations of TimeSAE on both synthetic and real-world time series datasets, comparing it to leading baselines. The results, supported by both quantitative metrics and qualitative insights, show that TimeSAE provides more faithful and robust explanations.

### [211] [QFed: Parameter-Compact Quantum-Classical Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09809)
*Samar Abdelghani,Soumaya Cherkaoui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces QFed, a quantum-enabled federated learning framework that reduces model parameters while maintaining accuracy, addressing challenges in federated learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address challenges in federated learning, such as statistical heterogeneity, system diversity, and computational burdens, by leveraging quantum computing.

Method: The authors develop QFed, a quantum-assisted framework, to reduce model complexity and enhance efficiency in federated learning, tested with the FashionMNIST dataset.

Result: Experimental findings reveal that QFed reduces model parameters by 77.6% while maintaining comparable accuracy to classical methods.

Conclusion: Quantum computing can significantly improve federated learning efficiency, particularly for edge devices, as demonstrated by the success of the QFed framework.

Abstract: Organizations and enterprises across domains such as healthcare, finance, and scientific research are increasingly required to extract collective intelligence from distributed, siloed datasets while adhering to strict privacy, regulatory, and sovereignty requirements. Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model building without sharing sensitive raw data, but faces growing challenges posed by statistical heterogeneity, system diversity, and the computational burden from complex models. This study examines the potential of quantum-assisted federated learning, which could cut the number of parameters in classical models by polylogarithmic factors and thus lessen training overhead. Accordingly, we introduce QFed, a quantum-enabled federated learning framework aimed at boosting computational efficiency across edge device networks. We evaluate the proposed framework using the widely adopted FashionMNIST dataset. Experimental results show that QFed achieves a 77.6% reduction in the parameter count of a VGG-like model while maintaining an accuracy comparable to classical approaches in a scalable environment. These results point to the potential of leveraging quantum computing within a federated learning context to strengthen FL capabilities of edge devices.

*Alireza Bakhtiari,Alex Ayoub,Samuel Robertson,David Janz,Csaba Szepesvári*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper establishes limitations of the eluder dimension in generalized linear models and proposes localized methods to achieve improved bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing eluder dimension-based analysis fails to achieve first-order regret bounds in generalized linear model classes.

Method: A localisation method is introduced for the eluder dimension to address shortcomings of standard analysis.

Result: Improved and first genuine first-order bounds for reinforcement learning tasks, including revisiting classic Bernoulli bandit results.

Conclusion: Localized eluder dimension analysis is more effective for achieving improved bounds in general reinforcement learning tasks.

Abstract: We establish a lower bound on the eluder dimension of generalised linear model classes, showing that standard eluder dimension-based analysis cannot lead to first-order regret bounds. To address this, we introduce a localisation method for the eluder dimension; our analysis immediately recovers and improves on classic results for Bernoulli bandits, and allows for the first genuine first-order bounds for finite-horizon reinforcement learning tasks with bounded cumulative returns.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding convergence of PnP-PGD when there is a mismatch in priors between training and inference data, filling the lack of theoretical guarantees under such settings.

Method: Developed a mathematical framework to provide convergence proofs for PnP-PGD under mismatched priors, avoiding restrictive and unverifiable assumptions present in existing works.

Result: Provided the first convergence proof of PnP-PGD in scenarios of prior mismatch, showing improved theoretical understanding compared to previous studies.

Conclusion: This work advances PnP algorithm theory by offering broader applicability through relaxed assumptions, enabling confidence in its application under more realistic mismatched data conditions.

Abstract: In this work, we provide a new convergence theory for plug-and-play proximal gradient descent (PnP-PGD) under prior mismatch where the denoiser is trained on a different data distribution to the inference task at hand. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first convergence proof of PnP-PGD under prior mismatch. Compared with the existing theoretical results for PnP algorithms, our new results removed the need for several restrictive and unverifiable assumptions.

### [214] [A pipeline for enabling path-specific causal fairness in observational health data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09841)
*Aparajita Kashyap,Sara Matijevic,Noémie Elhadad,Steven A. Kushner,Shalmali Joshi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a pipeline to train machine learning models addressing fairness in healthcare by tackling direct and indirect biases using causal fairness considerations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Healthcare ML models risk worsening existing biases, necessitating a fairness-driven approach to account for disparities in healthcare access and discrimination contexts.

Method: A model-agnostic pipeline applies path-specific causal fairness for structural bias analysis. Accuracy and fairness trade-offs are explored and foundation models are leveraged.

Result: The approach disentangles bias sources, balances accuracy-fairness trade-offs, and creates causally fair predictions trained on biased observational health data.

Conclusion: This pipeline provides a generalizable solution for ensuring fairness in ML healthcare models by addressing direct and indirect biases comprehensively.

Abstract: When training machine learning (ML) models for potential deployment in a healthcare setting, it is essential to ensure that they do not replicate or exacerbate existing healthcare biases. Although many definitions of fairness exist, we focus on path-specific causal fairness, which allows us to better consider the social and medical contexts in which biases occur (e.g., direct discrimination by a clinician or model versus bias due to differential access to the healthcare system) and to characterize how these biases may appear in learned models. In this work, we map the structural fairness model to the observational healthcare setting and create a generalizable pipeline for training causally fair models. The pipeline explicitly considers specific healthcare context and disparities to define a target "fair" model. Our work fills two major gaps: first, we expand on characterizations of the "fairness-accuracy" tradeoff by detangling direct and indirect sources of bias and jointly presenting these fairness considerations alongside considerations of accuracy in the context of broadly known biases. Second, we demonstrate how a foundation model trained without fairness constraints on observational health data can be leveraged to generate causally fair downstream predictions in tasks with known social and medical disparities. This work presents a model-agnostic pipeline for training causally fair machine learning models that address both direct and indirect forms of healthcare bias.

### [215] [Step-by-Step Causality: Transparent Causal Discovery with Multi-Agent Tree-Query and Adversarial Confidence Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10137)
*Ziyi Ding,Chenfei Ye-Hao,Zheyuan Wang,Xiao-Ping Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Tree-Query, a framework for causal discovery using a tree-structured, multi-expert LLM approach to improve interpretability and robustness over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Causal discovery is critical for understanding causal relationships, yet traditional methods suffer from error propagation, while modern LLM-based approaches lack interpretability and confidence measurement.

Method: The authors propose Tree-Query, a framework that uses a tree structure and multi-expert LLM queries to analyze causal relationships with interpretable judgments and robustness-aware confidence scores.

Result: Tree-Query outperforms direct LLM baselines on data-free benchmarks and demonstrates effective confounder screening and high-confidence causal conclusions in a case study.

Conclusion: Tree-Query provides a systematic and robust way to employ LLMs for data-free causal priors, bridging gaps in interpretability and reliability compared to traditional and LLM-based methods.

Abstract: Causal discovery aims to recover ``what causes what'', but classical constraint-based methods (e.g., PC, FCI) suffer from error propagation, and recent LLM-based causal oracles often behave as opaque, confidence-free black boxes. This paper introduces Tree-Query, a tree-structured, multi-expert LLM framework that reduces pairwise causal discovery to a short sequence of queries about backdoor paths, (in)dependence, latent confounding, and causal direction, yielding interpretable judgments with robustness-aware confidence scores. Theoretical guarantees are provided for asymptotic identifiability of four pairwise relations. On data-free benchmarks derived from Mooij et al. and UCI causal graphs, Tree-Query improves structural metrics over direct LLM baselines, and a diet--weight case study illustrates confounder screening and stable, high-confidence causal conclusions. Tree-Query thus offers a principled way to obtain data-free causal priors from LLMs that can complement downstream data-driven causal discovery.

### [216] [Advancing Model Refinement: Muon-Optimized Distillation and Quantization for LLM Deployment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09865)
*Jacob Sander,Brian Jalaian,Venkat R. Dasari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses optimizing Large Language Models (LLMs) for deployment on edge devices by combining GPTQ-based quantization, LoRA, and data distillation methods. The proposed approach reduces model size and complexity while maintaining or improving task-specific performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on resource-constrained edge devices is challenging due to their high demands for computational power, memory, and energy.

Method: The paper proposes a framework integrating GPTQ-based quantization, LoRA, and data distillation processes to compress models effectively. Techniques include knowledge distillation using Kullback-Leibler divergence, Bayesian hyperparameter optimization, and use of the Muon optimizer.

Result: The method achieves up to 2x memory compression (e.g., a 6GB model reduced to 3GB) and improved inference speed while maintaining superior performance on standard benchmarks compared to standalone GPTQ quantization.

Conclusion: Integrating quantization and adaptation techniques with distilled and optimized data enhances the efficiency and task-specific performance of LLMs on edge devices. This versatile approach is superior to GPTQ quantization alone.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable advanced natural language processing but face deployment challenges on resource-constrained edge devices due to high computational, memory, and energy demands. Optimizing these models requires addressing three key challenges: acquiring task-specific data, fine-tuning for performance, and compressing models to accelerate inference while reducing resource demands. We propose an integrated framework combining GPTQ-based quantization, low-rank adaptation (LoRA), and a specialized data distillation process to significantly reduce model size and complexity while preserving or enhancing task-specific performance. By leveraging data distillation, knowledge distillation via Kullback-Leibler divergence, Bayesian hyperparameter optimization, and the Muon optimizer, our pipeline achieves up to 2x memory compression (e.g., reducing a 6GB model to 3GB) and enables efficient inference for specialized tasks. Empirical results demonstrate superior performance on standard LLM benchmarks compared to GPTQ quantization alone, with the Muon optimizer notably enhancing fine-tuned models' resistance to accuracy decay during quantization.

### [217] [Reinforcement Learning with Multi-Step Lookahead Information Via Adaptive Batching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10418)
*Nadav Merlis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study explores tabular reinforcement learning problems with multi-step lookahead information, proposing adaptive batching policies (ABPs) that optimize observations for better decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance tabular reinforcement learning by leveraging multi-step lookahead information to improve decision-making while addressing inefficiencies of conventional heuristics like fixed batching and model predictive control.

Method: Developed optimal Bellman equations for adaptive batching policies (ABPs) and designed a regret-minimizing algorithm for learning ABPs in unknown environments.

Result: Achieved order-optimal regret bounds, only scaling with the small lookahead horizon constant, showcasing the potential of ABPs in reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: Adaptive batching policies (ABPs) provide a significant advantage, offering an effective and theoretically sound approach to utilizing multi-step lookahead information in reinforcement learning problems.

Abstract: We study tabular reinforcement learning problems with multiple steps of lookahead information. Before acting, the learner observes $\ell$ steps of future transition and reward realizations: the exact state the agent would reach and the rewards it would collect under any possible course of action. While it has been shown that such information can drastically boost the value, finding the optimal policy is NP-hard, and it is common to apply one of two tractable heuristics: processing the lookahead in chunks of predefined sizes ('fixed batching policies'), and model predictive control. We first illustrate the problems with these two approaches and propose utilizing the lookahead in adaptive (state-dependent) batches; we refer to such policies as adaptive batching policies (ABPs). We derive the optimal Bellman equations for these strategies and design an optimistic regret-minimizing algorithm that enables learning the optimal ABP when interacting with unknown environments. Our regret bounds are order-optimal up to a potential factor of the lookahead horizon $\ell$, which can usually be considered a small constant.

*Kirandeep Kaur,Vinayak Gupta,Aditya Gupta,Chirag Shah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProPer introduces a novel two-agent system for proactive assistance, addressing unexpressed user needs through implicit dimensions generated by DGA and tailored responses from RGA. It outperforms existing methods in multi-domain evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations in current reactive language-based assistants that fail to meet unexpressed user needs and proactive agents that disrupt interactions with excessive or ill-timed interventions.

Method: ProPer employs a two-agent architecture: Dimension Generating Agent (DGA) creates implicit dimensions from explicit user data, while Response Generating Agent (RGA) integrates these dimensions to give personalized, proactive responses. Filtering mechanisms ensure relevance and diversity.

Result: ProPer demonstrates enhanced performance across domains, showing improved user experience in coverage, initiative appropriateness, and intent alignment. Gains include 84% improvement in single-turn evaluations and superiority in multi-turn interactions.

Conclusion: ProPer effectively bridges the gap between reactive and proactive agents by balancing implicit and explicit user dimensions, enhancing personalization and intervention timing in diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Most language-based assistants follow a reactive ask-and-respond paradigm, requiring users to explicitly state their needs. As a result, relevant but unexpressed needs often go unmet. Existing proactive agents attempt to address this gap either by eliciting further clarification, preserving this burden, or by extrapolating future needs from context, often leading to unnecessary or mistimed interventions. We introduce ProPer, Proactivity-driven Personalized agents, a novel two-agent architecture consisting of a Dimension Generating Agent (DGA) and a Response Generating Agent (RGA). DGA, a fine-tuned LLM agent, leverages explicit user data to generate multiple implicit dimensions (latent aspects relevant to the user's task but not considered by the user) or knowledge gaps. These dimensions are selectively filtered using a reranker based on quality, diversity, and task relevance. RGA then balances explicit and implicit dimensions to tailor personalized responses with timely and proactive interventions. We evaluate ProPer across multiple domains using a structured, gap-aware rubric that measures coverage, initiative appropriateness, and intent alignment. Our results show that ProPer improves quality scores and win rates across all domains, achieving up to 84% gains in single-turn evaluation and consistent dominance in multi-turn interactions.

*Chenxi Qiu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an interpolation-based method for optimizing lp-norm Metric Differential Privacy (mDP) in fine-grained domains to reduce computational costs and utility loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for applying Metric Differential Privacy (mDP) face challenges in fine-grained or continuous domains due to the computational expense of constructing dense perturbation matrices and satisfying pointwise constraints.

Method: An interpolation-based framework is introduced, where perturbation distributions are optimized at anchor points and interpolated for other locations using log-convex combinations. To prevent high-dimensional privacy violations, interpolation is decomposed into one-dimensional steps and reformulated to enforce lp-norm mDP. Joint optimization is also explored for perturbation distributions and privacy budget allocation.

Result: Experiments on real-world location datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves rigorous privacy guarantees and competitive utility in fine-grained domains, surpassing baseline mechanisms.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully adapts Metric Differential Privacy to fine-grained domains, ensuring high accuracy and effective privacy protection.

Abstract: Metric Differential Privacy (mDP) generalizes Local Differential Privacy (LDP) by adapting privacy guarantees based on pairwise distances, enabling context-aware protection and improved utility. While existing optimization-based methods reduce utility loss effectively in coarse-grained domains, optimizing mDP in fine-grained or continuous settings remains challenging due to the computational cost of constructing dense perterubation matrices and satisfying pointwise constraints.
  In this paper, we propose an interpolation-based framework for optimizing lp-norm mDP in such domains. Our approach optimizes perturbation distributions at a sparse set of anchor points and interpolates distributions at non-anchor locations via log-convex combinations, which provably preserve mDP. To address privacy violations caused by naive interpolation in high-dimensional spaces, we decompose the interpolation process into a sequence of one-dimensional steps and derive a corrected formulation that enforces lp-norm mDP by design. We further explore joint optimization over perturbation distributions and privacy budget allocation across dimensions. Experiments on real-world location datasets demonstrate that our method offers rigorous privacy guarantees and competitive utility in fine-grained domains, outperforming baseline mechanisms. in high-dimensional spaces, we decompose the interpolation process into a sequence of one-dimensional steps and derive a corrected formulation that enforces lp-norm mDP by design.

*Griffin Kearney*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Kinematic Tokenization, a continuous-time technique to handle noisy signals in time series data, applied to financial contexts. Results show better policy performance under risk-averse objectives compared to discrete methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers struggle with real-world noisy continuous data due to limitations of discrete tokenization methods, especially under asymmetric loss conditions.

Method: Introduces Kinematic Tokenization that converts noisy signals into local spline coefficients (position, velocity, acceleration, jerk) for processing by models.

Result: When tested on financial asset data under a risk-averse classification objective, discrete baselines fail while the presented method achieves calibrated policies and actionable decision-making.

Conclusion: Continuous representation and tokenization enable improved model learnability and decision-making in noisy time series data compared to discrete approaches.

Abstract: Transformers are designed for discrete tokens, yet many real-world signals are continuous processes observed through noisy sampling. Discrete tokenizations (raw values, patches, finite differences) can be brittle in low signal-to-noise regimes, especially when downstream objectives impose asymmetric penalties that rationally encourage abstention. We introduce Kinematic Tokenization, an optimization-based continuous-time representation that reconstructs an explicit spline from noisy measurements and tokenizes local spline coefficients (position, velocity, acceleration, jerk). This is applied to financial time series data in the form of asset prices in conjunction with trading volume profiles. Across a multi-asset daily-equity testbed, we use a risk-averse asymmetric classification objective as a stress test for learnability. Under this objective, several discrete baselines collapse to an absorbing cash policy (the Liquidation Equilibrium), whereas the continuous spline tokens sustain calibrated, non-trivial action distributions and stable policies. These results suggest that explicit continuous-time tokens can improve the learnability and calibration of selective decision policies in noisy time series under abstention-inducing losses.

TL;DR: This paper critiques the unsustainable economic structure of the machine learning value chain and proposes a framework for equitable data-value exchange.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the economic inequality in data value distribution within the machine learning value chain, where data generators are disadvantaged.

Method: Analyzed seventy-three data deals to study value distribution and identified structural faults. Proposed the Equitable Data-Value Exchange (EDVEX) Framework.

Result: Found data aggregators benefit the most while data creators receive negligible royalties, with deal terms often opaque. Structural faults undermine fairness.

Conclusion: Recommends the EDVEX Framework to ensure fair value exchange and identifies research directions for improving the economics of data deals.

Abstract: We argue that the machine learning value chain is structurally unsustainable due to an economic data processing inequality: each state in the data cycle from inputs to model weights to synthetic outputs refines technical signal but strips economic equity from data generators. We show, by analyzing seventy-three public data deals, that the majority of value accrues to aggregators, with documented creator royalties rounding to zero and widespread opacity of deal terms. This is not just an economic welfare concern: as data and its derivatives become economic assets, the feedback loop that sustains current learning algorithms is at risk. We identify three structural faults - missing provenance, asymmetric bargaining power, and non-dynamic pricing - as the operational machinery of this inequality. In our analysis, we trace these problems along the machine learning value chain and propose an Equitable Data-Value Exchange (EDVEX) Framework to enable a minimal market that benefits all participants. Finally, we outline research directions where our community can make concrete contributions to data deals and contextualize our position with related and orthogonal viewpoints.

TL;DR: This study examines combining time series encoders with frozen LLM backbones for efficient time series classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage the reasoning and generalization capabilities of LLMs for time series classification tasks.

Method: The study evaluates various encoder architectures (Inception, convolutional, residual, transformer, and MLP) integrated with a fixed LLM for performance.

Result: The Inception encoder consistently outperformed others, achieving the best integration with LLM backbones.

Conclusion: Choosing an appropriate encoder, such as Inception, is critical in hybrid LLM architectures for time series learning.

Abstract: Time series classification (TSC) is a core machine learning problem with broad applications. Recently there has been growing interest in repurposing large language models (LLMs) for TSC, motivated by their strong reasoning and generalization ability. Prior work has primarily focused on alignment strategies that explicitly map time series data into the textual domain; however, the choice of time series encoder architecture remains underexplored. In this work, we conduct an exploratory study of hybrid architectures that combine specialized time series encoders with a frozen LLM backbone. We evaluate a diverse set of encoder families, including Inception, convolutional, residual, transformer-based, and multilayer perceptron architectures, among which the Inception model is the only encoder architecture that consistently yields positive performance gains when integrated with an LLM backbone. Overall, this study highlights the impact of time series encoder choice in hybrid LLM architectures and points to Inception-based models as a promising direction for future LLM-driven time series learning.

*Maissam Barkeshli,Alberto Alfarano,Andrey Gromov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates the origins of neural scaling laws and demonstrates that simplified graph-based training tasks and reduced language complexity still lead to scaling laws.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the origins of neural scaling laws and examine their relation to data and task complexity, as this is critical for understanding the model performance improvements with data, compute, and parameter scaling.

Method: The study uses transformers trained to predict random walks on graphs and systematically simplifies natural language tasks. It also revisits traditional scaling laws in language modeling, investigating parameterization methods and analysis of prior fits.

Result: The results show that neural scaling laws arise even without power law structure in data, and the complexity of language affects scaling exponents. Moreover, evidence suggests that maximal update parameterization might be more parameter efficient than standard approaches.

Conclusion: Scaling laws hold across varied levels of data complexity and structure, and new methods for analyzing and improving scaling can enhance model training efficiency.

Abstract: Scaling laws have played a major role in the modern AI revolution, providing practitioners predictive power over how the model performance will improve with increasing data, compute, and number of model parameters. This has spurred an intense interest in the origin of neural scaling laws, with a common suggestion being that they arise from power law structure already present in the data. In this paper we study scaling laws for transformers trained to predict random walks (bigrams) on graphs with tunable complexity. We demonstrate that this simplified setting already gives rise to neural scaling laws even in the absence of power law structure in the data correlations. We further consider dialing down the complexity of natural language systematically, by training on sequences sampled from increasingly simplified generative language models, from 4,2,1-layer transformer language models down to language bigrams, revealing a monotonic evolution of the scaling exponents. Our results also include scaling laws obtained from training on random walks on random graphs drawn from Erdös-Renyi and scale-free Barabási-Albert ensembles. Finally, we revisit conventional scaling laws for language modeling, demonstrating that several essential results can be reproduced using 2 layer transformers with context length of 50, provide a critical analysis of various fits used in prior literature, demonstrate an alternative method for obtaining compute optimal curves as compared with current practice in published literature, and provide preliminary evidence that maximal update parameterization may be more parameter efficient than standard parameterization.

*Frank Cole,Dixi Wang,Yineng Chen,Yulong Lu,Rongjie Lai*

TL;DR: The paper introduces in-context operator learning for optimal transport (OT), aiming to map pairs of distributions to OT maps based on few-shot samples without gradient-based updates at inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a method for solving optimal transport problems in a sample-efficient manner, reducing the dependence on gradient updates and achieving transferability across different tasks.

Method: The authors parameterize solution operators, design scaling-law theory for nonparametric and parametric settings, and validate performance through theory and numerical experiments.

Result: The method achieves generalization in low-dimensional task manifolds and exact OT map recovery in parametric settings, supported by experiments on synthetic and generative data.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables efficient and generalizable in-context learning for OT problems, with theoretical and experimental validation on various cases.

Abstract: We introduce \emph{in-context operator learning on probability measure spaces} for optimal transport (OT). The goal is to learn a single solution operator that maps a pair of distributions to the OT map, using only few-shot samples from each distribution as a prompt and \emph{without} gradient updates at inference. We parameterize the solution operator and develop scaling-law theory in two regimes. In the \emph{nonparametric} setting, when tasks concentrate on a low-intrinsic-dimension manifold of source--target pairs, we establish generalization bounds that quantify how in-context accuracy scales with prompt size, intrinsic task dimension, and model capacity. In the \emph{parametric} setting (e.g., Gaussian families), we give an explicit architecture that recovers the exact OT map in context and provide finite-sample excess-risk bounds. Our numerical experiments on synthetic transports and generative-modeling benchmarks validate the framework.

### [225] [Continuous-Depth Transformers with Learned Control Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10007)

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid transformer architecture integrating Neural ODEs for continuous-depth control during inference, enabling steering of generation attributes effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve control over generation attributes and overcome limitations of fixed discrete layers in standard transformers.

Method: Introduced a hybrid transformer with a continuous-depth ODE block governed by a learned vector field incorporating a low-dimensional control signal.

Result: The architecture demonstrated stability in gradient flow, effective semantic steering, minimal trajectory divergence, and efficiency comparable to discrete models.

Conclusion: Continuous-depth dynamics with learned control signals are efficient and feasible for steerable language generation.

Abstract: We present a hybrid transformer architecture that replaces discrete middle layers with a continuous-depth Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) block, enabling inference-time control over generation attributes via a learned steering signal. Unlike standard transformers that process representations through fixed discrete layers, our approach treats depth as a continuous variable governed by a learned vector field $F_θ(H, τ, u)$, where $u$ is a low-dimensional control signal injected via explicit concatenation. We validate the architecture through four experiments: (1) gradient flow stability with zero exploding/vanishing gradient events, (2) semantic steering achieving 98\%/88\% accuracy for positive/negative sentiment control, (3) continuous interpolation validated by a negligible 0.068\% trajectory divergence between fixed and adaptive solvers, and (4) efficiency benchmarking demonstrating latency parity with standard discrete baselines. Additionally, we show that adaptive ODE solvers reveal geometric structure in the learned dynamics: the control signal partitions the vector field into distinct dynamical regimes with different curvature characteristics. The adjoint method enables $O(1)$ memory training regardless of integration depth. Our results demonstrate that continuous-depth dynamics with learned control signals provide a viable, efficient mechanism for steerable language generation.

### [226] [PID-Guided Partial Alignment for Multimodal Decentralized Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10012)
*Yanhang Shi,Xiaoyu Wang,Houwei Cao,Jian Li,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PARSE, a framework enabling multimodal decentralized federated learning (DFL) by resolving challenges in sharing heterogeneous representations across peer-to-peer networks without central coordination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the complications of multimodal DFL, where agents vary in modalities and architectures, leading to gradient misalignment and suppressed cross-modal collaboration.

Method: PARSE leverages partial information decomposition (PID) to factorize agents' latent representations into redundant, unique, and synergistic slices, enabling slice-specific sharing across heterogeneous agents without central coordination.

Result: PARSE consistently outperforms other DFL baselines across various benchmarks, agent configurations, and demonstrates efficiency and robustness through ablation studies.

Conclusion: The study concludes that PARSE effectively resolves multimodal DFL challenges, providing superior performance in decentralized settings while adhering to standard constraints.

Abstract: Multimodal decentralized federated learning (DFL) is challenging because agents differ in available modalities and model architectures, yet must collaborate over peer-to-peer (P2P) networks without a central coordinator. Standard multimodal pipelines learn a single shared embedding across all modalities. In DFL, such a monolithic representation induces gradient misalignment between uni- and multimodal agents; as a result, it suppresses heterogeneous sharing and cross-modal interaction. We present PARSE, a multimodal DFL framework that operationalizes partial information decomposition (PID) in a server-free setting. Each agent performs feature fission to factorize its latent representation into redundant, unique, and synergistic slices. P2P knowledge sharing among heterogeneous agents is enabled by slice-level partial alignment: only semantically shareable branches are exchanged among agents that possess the corresponding modality. By removing the need for central coordination and gradient surgery, PARSE resolves uni-/multimodal gradient conflicts, thereby overcoming the multimodal DFL dilemma while remaining compatible with standard DFL constraints. Across benchmarks and agent mixes, PARSE yields consistent gains over task-, modality-, and hybrid-sharing DFL baselines. Ablations on fusion operators and split ratios, together with qualitative visualizations, further demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed design.

*Boyi Liu,Zimu Zhou,Yongxin Tong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CAFEDistill is proposed to address conflicts in Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) with Early-Exit Networks (EENs), achieving better accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PFL methods struggle with static models that fail to adapt to varying inference requirements in dynamic environments.

Method: CAFEDistill introduces a Conflict-Aware Federated Exit Distillation framework with a progressive, depth-prioritized student coordination mechanism.

Result: CAFEDistill surpasses state-of-the-arts, improving accuracy and cutting inference costs by 30.79%-46.86%.

Conclusion: CAFEDistill effectively resolves PFL challenges with EENs through adaptive and efficient approaches, enhancing practical utility.

Abstract: Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) enables collaboratively model training on decentralized, heterogeneous data while tailoring them to each client's unique distribution. However, existing PFL methods produce static models with a fixed tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency, limiting their applicability in environments where inference requirements vary with contexts and resource availability. Early-exit networks (EENs) offer adaptive inference by attaching intermediate classifiers. Yet integrating them into PFL is challenging due to client-wise heterogeneity and depth-wise interference arising from conflicting exit objectives. Prior studies fail to resolve both conflicts simultaneously, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose CAFEDistill, a Conflict-Aware Federated Exit Distillation framework that jointly addresses these conflicts and extends PFL to early-exit networks. Through a progressive, depth-prioritized student coordination mechanism, CAFEDistill mitigates interference among shallow and deep exits while allowing effective personalized knowledge transfer across clients. Furthermore, it reduces communication overhead via a client-decoupled formulation. Extensive evaluations show that CAFEDistill outperforms the state-of-the-arts, achieving higher accuracy and reducing inference costs by 30.79%-46.86%.

### [228] [Time Aggregation Features for XGBoost Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10019)
*Mykola Pinchuk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates time aggregation methods for XGBoost models in click-through rate prediction, identifying trailing windows as the most reliable option for improving model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to investigate effective time aggregation features for predictive performance in the Avazu click-through rate dataset, following strict out-of-time and no-lookahead feature constraints.

Method: Time-aware target encoding and entity history time aggregation are applied in models, using varying time window designs (trailing, event count, gap, and bucketized windows) for evaluation.

Result: Trailing windows enhance ROC AUC by 0.0066 to 0.0082 and PR AUC by 0.0084 to 0.0094 over target encoding alone. Event count windows show minor improvement, while gap and bucketized windows underperform.

Conclusion: Trailing windows emerge as the default recommended approach for time series aggregation in click-through rate prediction, with event count windows offering slight additional improvements in specific cases.

Abstract: This paper studies time aggregation features for XGBoost models in click-through rate prediction. The setting is the Avazu click-through rate prediction dataset with strict out-of-time splits and a no-lookahead feature constraint. Features for hour H use only impressions from hours strictly before H. This paper compares a strong time-aware target encoding baseline to models augmented with entity history time aggregation under several window designs. Across two rolling-tail folds on a deterministic ten percent sample, a trailing window specification improves ROC AUC by about 0.0066 to 0.0082 and PR AUC by about 0.0084 to 0.0094 relative to target encoding alone. Within the time aggregation design grid, event count windows provide the only consistent improvement over trailing windows, and the gain is small. Gap windows and bucketized windows underperform simple trailing windows in this dataset and protocol. These results support a practical default of trailing windows, with an optional event count window when marginal ROC AUC gains matter.

### [229] [BPE: Behavioral Profiling Ensemble](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10024)
*Yanxin Liu,Yunqi Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Behavioral Profiling Ensemble (BPE) framework, which improves traditional static and dynamic ensemble methods by using an intrinsic behavioral profile for integration rather than relying on model divergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of static and dynamic ensemble methods that neglect individual model characteristics and depend heavily on validation sets.

Method: The proposed BPE framework assigns integration weights based on the deviation of a model's response to a behavioral profile constructed specifically for it.

Result: The BPE framework shows significant improvements in predictive accuracy, computational efficiency, and resource utilization compared to state-of-the-art ensemble methods.

Conclusion: BPE introduces a paradigm shift in ensemble learning by leveraging intrinsic behavioral profiles of models, offering superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Ensemble learning is widely recognized as a pivotal strategy for pushing the boundaries of predictive performance. Traditional static ensemble methods, such as Stacking, typically assign weights by treating each base learner as a holistic entity, thereby overlooking the fact that individual models exhibit varying degrees of competence across different regions of the instance space. To address this limitation, Dynamic Ensemble Selection (DES) was introduced. However, both static and dynamic approaches predominantly rely on the divergence among different models as the basis for integration. This inter-model perspective neglects the intrinsic characteristics of the models themselves and necessitates a heavy reliance on validation sets for competence estimation. In this paper, we propose the Behavioral Profiling Ensemble (BPE) framework, which introduces a novel paradigm shift. Unlike traditional methods, BPE constructs a ``behavioral profile'' intrinsic to each model and derives integration weights based on the deviation between the model's response to a specific test instance and its established behavioral profile. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the algorithm derived from the BPE framework achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art ensemble baselines. These gains are evident not only in predictive accuracy but also in computational efficiency and storage resource utilization across various scenarios.

### [230] [Unlabeled Data Can Provably Enhance In-Context Learning of Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10058)
*Renpu Liu,Jing Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes an augmented in-context learning (ICL) framework, leveraging unlabeled data alongside labeled examples in prompts to enhance ICL performance, particularly in multi-class linear classification with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models are limited by the few labeled demonstrations that can fit into a prompt. There is a need to explore how vast amounts of unlabeled data can improve ICL performance.

Method: The authors introduced an augmented ICL framework combining labeled examples and blocks of unlabeled inputs. With chain-of-thought prompting, a multi-layer transformer emulates an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, extracting useful information from both labeled and unlabeled data.

Result: The augmented ICL framework improves ICL accuracy and consistently outperforms conventional few-shot ICL. Theoretical findings are supported by experimental results.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates how unlabeled data can contribute to improving transformers' ICL capabilities, providing both empirical and theoretical insights into its advantages.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, yet the quality of their predictions is fundamentally limited by the few costly labeled demonstrations that can fit into a prompt. Meanwhile, there exist vast and continuously growing amounts of unlabeled data that may be closely related to the ICL task. How to utilize such unlabeled data to provably enhance the performance of ICL thus becomes an emerging fundamental question. In this work, we propose a novel augmented ICL framework, in which the prompt includes a small set of labeled examples alongside a block of unlabeled inputs. We focus on the multi-class linear classification setting and demonstrate that, with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, a multi-layer transformer can effectively emulate an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. This enables the transformer to implicitly extract useful information from both labeled and unlabeled data, leading to provable improvements in ICL accuracy. Moreover, we show that such a transformer can be trained via teacher forcing, with its parameters converging to the desired solution at a linear rate. Experiments demonstrate that the augmented ICL framework consistently outperforms conventional few-shot ICL, providing empirical support for our theoretical findings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical study on the impact of unlabeled data on the ICL performance of transformers.

*Hung Vinh Tran,Tong Chen,Hechuan Wen,Quoc Viet Hung Nguyen,Bin Cui,Hongzhi Yin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces NaCS, a new framework improving coreset selection for content-based recommendation systems by addressing noisy data and enhancing efficiency without impacting performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring effective content-based recommendation systems requires resource-intensive model training processes. The paper aims to reduce computational costs by developing improved coreset selection methods.

Method: NaCS employs submodular optimization with training gradients to construct coresets, correct noisy labels using a progressively trained model, and filters low-confidence samples based on uncertainty quantification.

Result: NaCS improves coreset quality, enhances training efficiency, and recovers 93-95% of full-dataset training performance using just 1% of training data.

Conclusion: NaCS demonstrates significant advancements in coreset quality and efficiency for recommendation systems, paving the way for resource-efficient model training processes in data-rich environments.

Abstract: Content-based recommendation systems (CRSs) utilize content features to predict user-item interactions, serving as essential tools for helping users navigate information-rich web services. However, ensuring the effectiveness of CRSs requires large-scale and even continuous model training to accommodate diverse user preferences, resulting in significant computational costs and resource demands. A promising approach to this challenge is coreset selection, which identifies a small but representative subset of data samples that preserves model quality while reducing training overhead. Yet, the selected coreset is vulnerable to the pervasive noise in user-item interactions, particularly when it is minimally sized. To this end, we propose Noise-aware Coreset Selection (NaCS), a specialized framework for CRSs. NaCS constructs coresets through submodular optimization based on training gradients, while simultaneously correcting noisy labels using a progressively trained model. Meanwhile, we refine the selected coreset by filtering out low-confidence samples through uncertainty quantification, thereby avoid training with unreliable interactions. Through extensive experiments, we show that NaCS produces higher-quality coresets for CRSs while achieving better efficiency than existing coreset selection techniques. Notably, NaCS recovers 93-95\% of full-dataset training performance using merely 1\% of the training data.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a deep learning model (HuSHeM) for assessing sperm morphology, demonstrating higher predictive reliability and clinical utility compared to WHO(+SIRI) criteria.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the subjectivity, inter-observer variability, and resource constraints in assessing sperm morphological quality using a more accurate and objective method.

Method: The study develops and trains the HuSHeM model on high-resolution sperm morphology images, compares it to WHO(+SIRI) criteria, and evaluates its performance through discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility analyses.

Result: The HuSHeM model provides higher discriminative performance with better calibration, precision-recall, and clinical utility outcomes compared to WHO(+SIRI) criteria.

Conclusion: The deep learning-based HuSHeM model shows potential for improving the assessment of sperm morphology as a decision-support tool, offering more objectivity and reproducibility without replacing clinical judgment.

Abstract: Assessment of sperm morphological quality remains a critical yet subjective component of male fertility evaluation, often limited by inter-observer variability and resource constraints. This study presents a comparative biomedical artificial intelligence framework evaluating an image-based deep learning model (HuSHeM) alongside a clinically grounded baseline derived from World Health Organization criteria augmented with the Systemic Inflammation Response Index (WHO(+SIRI)).
  The HuSHeM model was trained on high-resolution sperm morphology images and evaluated using an independent clinical cohort. Model performance was assessed using discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility analyses. The HuSHeM model demonstrated higher discriminative performance, as reflected by an increased area under the receiver operating characteristic curve with relatively narrow confidence intervals compared to WHO(+SIRI). Precision-recall analysis further indicated improved performance under class imbalance, with higher precision-recall area values across evaluated thresholds. Calibration analysis indicated closer agreement between predicted probabilities and observed outcomes for HuSHeM, while decision curve analysis suggested greater net clinical benefit across clinically relevant threshold probabilities.
  These findings suggest that image-based deep learning may offer improved predictive reliability and clinical utility compared with traditional rule-based and inflammation-augmented criteria. The proposed framework supports objective and reproducible assessment of sperm morphology and may serve as a decision-support tool within fertility screening and referral workflows. The proposed models are intended as decision-support or referral tools and are not designed to replace clinical judgment or laboratory assessment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sparse-RL addresses memory overhead in RL training for LLMs by introducing sparsity-aware methods that correct policy mismatches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Excessive memory demands during RL training for LLMs create hardware limitations, hindering the deployment of long-horizon rollouts.

Method: Sparse-RL uses Sparsity-Aware Rejection Sampling and Importance-based Reweighting to address off-policy bias caused by sparse rollouts.

Result: Sparse-RL reduces rollout overhead while maintaining performance and enhances robustness during sparse inference.

Conclusion: Sparse-RL offers stable RL training with sparse rollouts, ensuring efficient memory use and improved model robustness without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become essential for eliciting complex reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the substantial memory overhead of storing Key-Value (KV) caches during long-horizon rollouts acts as a critical bottleneck, often prohibiting efficient training on limited hardware. While existing KV compression techniques offer a remedy for inference, directly applying them to RL training induces a severe policy mismatch, leading to catastrophic performance collapse. To address this, we introduce Sparse-RL empowers stable RL training under sparse rollouts. We show that instability arises from a fundamental policy mismatch among the dense old policy, the sparse sampler policy, and the learner policy. To mitigate this issue, Sparse-RL incorporates Sparsity-Aware Rejection Sampling and Importance-based Reweighting to correct the off-policy bias introduced by compression-induced information loss. Experimental results show that Sparse-RL reduces rollout overhead compared to dense baselines while preserving the performance. Furthermore, Sparse-RL inherently implements sparsity-aware training, significantly enhancing model robustness during sparse inference deployment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study introduces Adaptive Label Error Detection (ALED), a novel method to identify mislabeling in datasets. Using intermediate features of neural networks and statistical modeling, ALED significantly improves mislabel detection in medical imaging with robust results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the critical issue of mislabeled data in machine learning models, which can affect their performance even with expert-curated datasets, and improve the accuracy of such systems.

Method: The authors propose ALED, a framework that uses convolutional neural network intermediate features, denoises them, models class distributions with multidimensional Gaussian methods, and performs likelihood ratio testing to detect errors.

Result: ALED demonstrates markedly improved sensitivity and high precision compared to existing detection methods, effectively reducing errors in multiple medical imaging datasets. Fine-tuning with corrected data led to a 33.8% decrease in test set errors.

Conclusion: ALED significantly enhances the ability to identify mislabeled data in AI models, offering substantial improvements in model accuracy. It has been implemented in the Python package statlab for practical use.

Abstract: Machine learning classification systems are susceptible to poor performance when trained with incorrect ground truth labels, even when data is well-curated by expert annotators. As machine learning becomes more widespread, it is increasingly imperative to identify and correct mislabeling to develop more powerful models. In this work, we motivate and describe Adaptive Label Error Detection (ALED), a novel method of detecting mislabeling. ALED extracts an intermediate feature space from a deep convolutional neural network, denoises the features, models the reduced manifold of each class with a multidimensional Gaussian distribution, and performs a simple likelihood ratio test to identify mislabeled samples. We show that ALED has markedly increased sensitivity, without compromising precision, compared to established label error detection methods, on multiple medical imaging datasets. We demonstrate an example where fine-tuning a neural network on corrected data results in a 33.8% decrease in test set errors, providing strong benefits to end users. The ALED detector is deployed in the Python package statlab.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies gaps in medical meta-analyses due to a missing key decision variable and proposes a Bayesian approach to address this issue, with a focus on TOLAC scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the inability of traditional medical meta-analyses to account for a crucial decision-making variable influencing physician decisions, resulting in unreliable conclusions.

Method: The authors develop a Bayesian analytical framework tailored to assess the claim of a positive effect in medical studies, specifically applied to Trial of Labor After Cesarean-section (TOLAC) scenarios.

Result: The proposed Bayesian approach demonstrates utility in supporting physicians by providing a better framework for evaluating TOLAC cases with limited patient intervention options.

Conclusion: The Bayesian approach helps overcome gaps in prior meta-analyses by allowing physicians to make more reliable decisions, advancing patient care in medical scenarios like TOLAC.

Abstract: The meta-analysis's utility is dependent on previous studies having accurately captured the variables of interest, but in medical studies, a key decision variable that impacts a physician's decisions was not captured. This results in an unknown effect size and unreliable conclusions. A Bayesian approach may allow analysis to determine if the claim of a positive effect is still warranted, and we build a Bayesian approach to this common medical scenario. To demonstrate its utility, we assist professional OBGYNs in evaluating Trial of Labor After a Cesarean-section (TOLAC) situations where few interventions are available for patients and find the support needed for physicians to advance patient care.

TL;DR: The paper presents LeMoF, a framework for improved multimodal clinical prediction by selectively integrating different levels of modality-specific representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing multimodal prediction methods that rely on static integration schemes and simple fusion strategies, and fail to fully utilize modality-specific representations.

Method: The proposed method, Level-guided Modal Fusion (LeMoF), integrates representations extracted from different layers of each modality's encoder, explicitly separating global modality predictions and level-specific discriminative representations.

Result: LeMoF outperformed state-of-the-art multimodal fusion techniques on ICU length of stay prediction, maintaining robust performance across different clinical conditions and encoder configurations.

Conclusion: Level-wise integration plays a key role in achieving balanced accuracy and discriminative power in heterogeneous clinical environments, making LeMoF highly effective for multimodal clinical predictions.

Abstract: Multimodal clinical prediction is widely used to integrate heterogeneous data such as Electronic Health Records (EHR) and biosignals. However, existing methods tend to rely on static modality integration schemes and simple fusion strategies. As a result, they fail to fully exploit modality-specific representations. In this paper, we propose Level-guided Modal Fusion (LeMoF), a novel framework that selectively integrates level-guided representations within each modality. Each level refers to a representation extracted from a different layer of the encoder. LeMoF explicitly separates and learns global modality-level predictions from level-specific discriminative representations. This design enables LeMoF to achieve a balanced performance between prediction stability and discriminative capability even in heterogeneous clinical environments. Experiments on length of stay prediction using Intensive Care Unit (ICU) data demonstrate that LeMoF consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art multimodal fusion techniques across various encoder configurations. We also confirmed that level-wise integration is a key factor in achieving robust predictive performance across various clinical conditions.

TL;DR: METAL introduces a lightweight alignment method for mapping multilingual text embeddings into multimodal spaces, achieving competitive performance in both English and multilingual zero-shot tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the performance gap of multimodal models beyond English due to the scarcity of multilingual multimodal resources.

Method: METAL uses a few linear layers trained with English text to align multilingual text embeddings into multimodal spaces, with qualitative visualizations and weight analyses highlighting embedding transformations.

Result: METAL achieved 94.9 percent Recall at 10 for English and strong multilingual zero-shot transfer with 89.5 percent Recall at 10 across 11 languages, including 10 unseen ones.

Conclusion: METAL effectively aligns multilingual text embeddings with multimodal representations, offering robust performance across image-text and audio-text retrieval, and enables cross-lingual text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Multimodal models excel in English, supported by abundant image-text and audio-text data, but performance drops sharply for other languages due to limited multilingual multimodal resources. Existing solutions rely heavily on machine translation, while advances in multilingual text modeling remain underutilized. We introduce METAL, a lightweight alignment method that learns only a few linear layers using English text alone to map multilingual text embeddings into a multimodal space. Despite its simplicity, METAL matches baseline performance in English (94.9 percent Recall at 10) and achieves strong zero-shot transfer (89.5 percent Recall at 10 averaged across 11 languages, 10 unseen) on XTD text-to-image retrieval. Qualitative t-SNE visualizations show that multilingual embeddings align tightly with multimodal representations, while weight analysis reveals that the transformation reshapes embedding geometry rather than performing trivial rotations. Beyond image-text retrieval, METAL generalizes to audio-text retrieval and cross-lingual text-to-image generation. We release code and checkpoints at https://github.com/m2m-codebase/M2M , as well as multilingual evaluation datasets including MSCOCO Multilingual 30K (https://huggingface.co/datasets/piyushsinghpasi/mscoco-multilingual-30k ), AudioCaps Multilingual (https://huggingface.co/datasets/piyushsinghpasi/audiocaps-multilingual ), and Clotho Multilingual (https://huggingface.co/datasets/piyushsinghpasi/clotho-multilingual ), to facilitate further research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Safety-Preserving Fine-tuning (SPF), a new method to address the safety-utility trade-off when fine-tuning large language models. It ensures task performance while maintaining safety alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the widespread problem of safety degradation in large language models during fine-tuning, which conflicts with task performance.

Method: SPF removes gradient components that conflict with the low-rank subspace of safety-oriented gradients, ensuring safety alignment while maintaining model performance.

Result: SPF achieves strong task performance and recovers pre-trained safety alignment better than other methods. It resists adversarial fine-tuning and jailbreak attacks.

Conclusion: The study provides a theoretical framework and a practical solution for safe and effective fine-tuning, advancing understanding and tools for maintaining alignment in LLMs.

Abstract: Fine-tuning is an essential and pervasive functionality for applying large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks. However, it has the potential to substantially degrade safety alignment, e.g., by greatly increasing susceptibility to jailbreak attacks, even when the fine-tuning data is entirely harmless. Despite garnering growing attention in defense efforts during the fine-tuning stage, existing methods struggle with a persistent safety-utility dilemma: emphasizing safety compromises task performance, whereas prioritizing utility typically requires deep fine-tuning that inevitably leads to steep safety declination.
  In this work, we address this dilemma by shedding new light on the geometric interaction between safety- and utility-oriented gradients in safety-aligned LLMs. Through systematic empirical analysis, we uncover three key insights: (I) safety gradients lie in a low-rank subspace, while utility gradients span a broader high-dimensional space; (II) these subspaces are often negatively correlated, causing directional conflicts during fine-tuning; and (III) the dominant safety direction can be efficiently estimated from a single sample. Building upon these novel insights, we propose safety-preserving fine-tuning (SPF), a lightweight approach that explicitly removes gradient components conflicting with the low-rank safety subspace. Theoretically, we show that SPF guarantees utility convergence while bounding safety drift. Empirically, SPF consistently maintains downstream task performance and recovers nearly all pre-trained safety alignment, even under adversarial fine-tuning scenarios. Furthermore, SPF exhibits robust resistance to both deep fine-tuning and dynamic jailbreak attacks. Together, our findings provide new mechanistic understanding and practical guidance toward always-aligned LLM fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in graph learning due to lack of labels, ineffective data enhancement techniques, and dependence on negative samples.

Method: SNGCL leverages a multilayer Laplace smoothing filter and siamese network architecture with an improved triple recombination loss function.

Result: SNGCL demonstrated strong competitive performance in node classification tasks compared to state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: The proposed SNGCL method can effectively handle issues in contrastive learning for graphs, enhancing node classification tasks.

Abstract: The effectiveness of contrastive learning methods has been widely recognized in the field of graph learning, especially in contexts where graph data often lack labels or are difficult to label. However, the application of these methods to node classification tasks still faces a number of challenges. First, existing data enhancement techniques may lead to significant differences from the original view when generating new views, which may weaken the relevance of the view and affect the efficiency of model training. Second, the vast majority of existing graph comparison learning algorithms rely on the use of a large number of negative samples. To address the above challenges, this study proposes a novel node classification contrast learning method called Simple Network Graph Comparative Learning (SNGCL). Specifically, SNGCL employs a superimposed multilayer Laplace smoothing filter as a step in processing the data to obtain global and local feature smoothing matrices, respectively, which are thus passed into the target and online networks of the siamese network, and finally employs an improved triple recombination loss function to bring the intra-class distance closer and the inter-class distance farther. We have compared SNGCL with state-of-the-art models in node classification tasks, and the experimental results show that SNGCL is strongly competitive in most tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of deploying large language models on edge devices by effectively compressing the KV cache, which current quantization methods fail to do efficiently.

Method: LOOKAT uses product quantization and asymmetric distance computation. It decomposes key vectors into subspaces, learns codebooks, and enables attention computation via lookup tables, transitioning attention from memory-bound to compute-bound.

Result: LOOKAT achieves significant compression rates of 64x at 95.7% fidelity and 32x at 95.0% fidelity, all while maintaining a rank correlation of ρ > 0.95.

Conclusion: LOOKAT offers a practical, architecture-agnostic solution for KV cache compression, maintaining high fidelity and performance, as validated both theoretically and experimentally.

Abstract: Compressing the KV cache is a required step to deploy large language models on edge devices. Current quantization methods compress storage but fail to reduce bandwidth as attention calculation requires dequantizing keys from INT4/INT8 to FP16 before use. We observe that attention scoring is mathematically equivalent to the inner product similarity search and we can apply some compression techniques from vector databases to compress KV-cache better. We propose LOOKAT, which applies product quantization and asymmetric distance computation, to transformer architecture by decomposing key vectors into subspaces, learning codebooks and computing attention tables via lookup tables. This transforms attention from memory-bound to compute-bound. LOOKAT achieves 64 $\times$ compression at 95.7\% output fidelity and 32 $\times$ compression at 95.0\% fidelity when tested on GPT-2. LOOKAT requires no architecture changes or training while maintaining rank correlation $ρ> 0.95$. Theoretical analysis confirms that rank correlation degrades as $O(d_k/mK)$, with guarantees validated across sequence lengths up to 1024 tokens.

*Mingyu Zhao,Haoran Bai,Yu Tian,Bing Zhu,Hengliang Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CC-OR-Net, a novel framework for predicting Customer Lifetime Value (LTV), effectively addressing challenges related to zero-inflated, long-tail data distributions by using structural decompositions and targeted modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to tackle two main challenges in LTV prediction: the overwhelming number of low-to-medium value users compared to high-value users and the heterogeneity within the low-to-medium value user group.

Method: The proposed CC-OR-Net framework utilizes three components: a structural ordinal decomposition module for ranking, an intra-bucket residual module for fine regression, and a high-value augmentation module for improved precision on high-value users.

Result: The CC-OR-Net framework demonstrated superior performance on real-world datasets with over 300 million users, surpassing existing methods across key business metrics.

Conclusion: CC-OR-Net proves to be a highly effective and commercially valuable solution for LTV prediction, offering a balanced trade-off between accuracy and precision, especially for high-value users.

Abstract: Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) prediction, a central problem in modern marketing, is characterized by a unique zero-inflated and long-tail data distribution. This distribution presents two fundamental challenges: (1) the vast majority of low-to-medium value users numerically overwhelm the small but critically important segment of high-value "whale" users, and (2) significant value heterogeneity exists even within the low-to-medium value user base. Common approaches either rely on rigid statistical assumptions or attempt to decouple ranking and regression using ordered buckets; however, they often enforce ordinality through loss-based constraints rather than inherent architectural design, failing to balance global accuracy with high-value precision. To address this gap, we propose \textbf{C}onditional \textbf{C}ascaded \textbf{O}rdinal-\textbf{R}esidual Networks \textbf{(CC-OR-Net)}, a novel unified framework that achieves a more robust decoupling through \textbf{structural decomposition}, where ranking is architecturally guaranteed. CC-OR-Net integrates three specialized components: a \textit{structural ordinal decomposition module} for robust ranking, an \textit{intra-bucket residual module} for fine-grained regression, and a \textit{targeted high-value augmentation module} for precision on top-tier users. Evaluated on real-world datasets with over 300M users, CC-OR-Net achieves a superior trade-off across all key business metrics, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in creating a holistic and commercially valuable LTV prediction solution.

*Chuyi Wang,Xiaohui Xie,Tongze Wang,Yong Cui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces BiasSeeker, a model-agnostic framework to detect shortcut features in encrypted traffic datasets and improve generalization by mitigating biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-trained models for encrypted traffic classification often rely on spurious correlations, which fail to generalize to real-world data. Existing solutions lack adaptability and generality.

Method: The paper proposes BiasSeeker, a semi-automated, model-agnostic framework that analyzes raw binary traffic using statistical correlation methods to identify and mitigate dataset-specific shortcut features.

Result: BiasSeeker was evaluated on 19 public datasets across three NTC tasks, successfully diagnosing shortcut learning and facilitating context-aware feature selection.

Conclusion: BiasSeeker highlights the importance of feature selection in encrypted traffic classification, offering a generalizable solution for addressing biases while ensuring meaningful data retention.

Abstract: Pre-trained models operating directly on raw bytes have achieved promising performance in encrypted network traffic classification (NTC), but often suffer from shortcut learning-relying on spurious correlations that fail to generalize to real-world data. Existing solutions heavily rely on model-specific interpretation techniques, which lack adaptability and generality across different model architectures and deployment scenarios.
  In this paper, we propose BiasSeeker, the first semi-automated framework that is both model-agnostic and data-driven for detecting dataset-specific shortcut features in encrypted traffic. By performing statistical correlation analysis directly on raw binary traffic, BiasSeeker identifies spurious or environment-entangled features that may compromise generalization, independent of any classifier. To address the diverse nature of shortcut features, we introduce a systematic categorization and apply category-specific validation strategies that reduce bias while preserving meaningful information.
  We evaluate BiasSeeker on 19 public datasets across three NTC tasks. By emphasizing context-aware feature selection and dataset-specific diagnosis, BiasSeeker offers a novel perspective for understanding and addressing shortcut learning in encrypted network traffic classification, raising awareness that feature selection should be an intentional and scenario-sensitive step prior to model training.

*Kiattikun Chobtham*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel climate index derived from sea surface temperature for improving rainfall prediction in Thailand using Deep Q-Networks and Long Short-Term Memory models, achieving significant error reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the difficulty of long-term climate prediction in specific regions of Thailand due to complex spatiotemporal patterns and the lack of localized climate indices.

Method: The paper introduces a new monsoon climate index that is optimized using a Deep Q-Network reinforcement learning agent. It selects effective index areas for seasonal rainfall prediction, and integrates this index into Long Short-Term Memory models for forecasting.

Result: Incorporating the optimized climate index showed significant improvements in long-term rainfall prediction for most areas, with reduced Root Mean Square Error for forecasts up to 12 months ahead.

Conclusion: The optimized local monsoon climate index combined with advanced machine learning models enhances rainfall prediction accuracy in various regions of Thailand.

Abstract: Climate prediction is a challenge due to the intricate spatiotemporal patterns within Earth systems. Global climate indices, such as the El Niño Southern Oscillation, are standard input features for long-term rainfall prediction. However, a significant gap persists regarding local-scale indices capable of improving predictive accuracy in specific regions of Thailand. This paper introduces a novel NorthEast monsoon climate index calculated from sea surface temperature to reflect the climatology of the boreal winter monsoon. To optimise the calculated areas used for this index, a Deep Q-Network reinforcement learning agent explores and selects the most effective rectangles based on their correlation with seasonal rainfall. Rainfall stations were classified into 12 distinct clusters to distinguish rainfall patterns between southern and upper Thailand. Experimental results show that incorporating the optimised index into Long Short-Term Memory models significantly improves long-term monthly rainfall prediction skill in most cluster areas. This approach effectively reduces the Root Mean Square Error for 12-month-ahead forecasts.

### [244] [Graph Regularized PCA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10199)
*Antonio Briola,Marwin Schmidt,Fabio Caccioli,Carlos Ros Perez,James Singleton,Christian Michler,Tomaso Aste*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method called Graph Regularized PCA (GR-PCA), which improves principal component analysis by incorporating graph-based dependency structures in high-dimensional data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional data often involve dependencies among variables that break the isotropic noise assumption, making traditional PCA suboptimal.

Method: GR-PCA integrates graph-based regularization into PCA, utilizing sparse precision graphs and graph Laplacians to preserve low-frequency components while suppressing high-frequency noise.

Result: GR-PCA outperforms conventional methods by concentrating variance on relevant supports, reducing graph-Laplacian energy, and maintaining structural fidelity, especially in graph-correlated high-frequency signals.

Conclusion: The method provides an efficient and scalable route to dimensionality reduction, enhancing structural fidelity without compromising predictive performance.

Abstract: High-dimensional data often exhibit dependencies among variables that violate the isotropic-noise assumption under which principal component analysis (PCA) is optimal. For cases where the noise is not independent and identically distributed across features (i.e., the covariance is not spherical) we introduce Graph Regularized PCA (GR-PCA). It is a graph-based regularization of PCA that incorporates the dependency structure of the data features by learning a sparse precision graph and biasing loadings toward the low-frequency Fourier modes of the corresponding graph Laplacian. Consequently, high-frequency signals are suppressed, while graph-coherent low-frequency ones are preserved, yielding interpretable principal components aligned with conditional relationships. We evaluate GR-PCA on synthetic data spanning diverse graph topologies, signal-to-noise ratios, and sparsity levels. Compared to mainstream alternatives, it concentrates variance on the intended support, produces loadings with lower graph-Laplacian energy, and remains competitive in out-of-sample reconstruction. When high-frequency signals are present, the graph Laplacian penalty prevents overfitting, reducing the reconstruction accuracy but improving structural fidelity. The advantage over PCA is most pronounced when high-frequency signals are graph-correlated, whereas PCA remains competitive when such signals are nearly rotationally invariant. The procedure is simple to implement, modular with respect to the precision estimator, and scalable, providing a practical route to structure-aware dimensionality reduction that improves structural fidelity without sacrificing predictive performance.

### [245] [PRL: Process Reward Learning Improves LLMs' Reasoning Ability and Broadens the Reasoning Boundary](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10201)
*Jiarui Yao,Ruida Wang,Tong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents Process Reward Learning (PRL) to enhance reasoning abilities in Large Language Models (LLMs), utilizing step-wise supervision rather than outcome-based evaluation, and demonstrates its effectiveness in improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations in existing methods for improving LLM reasoning, such as reliance on coarse outcome rewards, low training efficiency due to additional complexities, and the lack of theoretical clarity in process signal design.

Method: The authors propose the Process Reward Learning (PRL) framework, which uses a theoretically derived formulation to convert outcome rewards into intermediate process signals. This involves entropy-regularized reinforcement learning with process-level rewards and a KL-divergence penalty for guidance.

Result: PRL improves reasoning abilities in LLMs, as shown by higher average performance and expanded reasoning capacity in metrics such as average @ n and pass @ n. Extensive experiments confirm PRL's effectiveness and generalizability.

Conclusion: PRL is an efficient and theoretically supported method for enhancing LLM reasoning, outperforming existing frameworks by providing finer supervision during training and better guiding model optimization.

Abstract: Improving the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been a continuous topic recently. But most relevant works are based on outcome rewards at the trajectory level, missing fine-grained supervision during the reasoning process. Other existing training frameworks that try to combine process signals together to optimize LLMs also rely heavily on tedious additional steps like MCTS, training a separate reward model, etc., doing harm to the training efficiency. Moreover, the intuition behind the process signals design lacks rigorous theoretical support, leaving the understanding of the optimization mechanism opaque. In this paper, we propose Process Reward Learning (PRL), which decomposes the entropy regularized reinforcement learning objective into intermediate steps, with rigorous process rewards that could be assigned to models accordingly. Starting from theoretical motivation, we derive the formulation of PRL that is essentially equivalent to the objective of reward maximization plus a KL-divergence penalty term between the policy model and a reference model. However, PRL could turn the outcome reward into process supervision signals, which helps better guide the exploration during RL optimization. From our experiment results, we demonstrate that PRL not only improves the average performance for LLMs' reasoning ability measured by average @ n, but also broadens the reasoning boundary by improving the pass @ n metric. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of PRL could be verified and generalized.

### [246] [Fundamental Limitations of Favorable Privacy-Utility Guarantees for DP-SGD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10237)
*Murat Bilgehan Ertan,Marten van Dijk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper examines limitations of DP-SGD under worst-case adversarial privacy definitions, finding an inherent trade-off between privacy strength and utility due to noise constraints that significantly affects training accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the limitations of differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) under worst-case adversarial conditions in achieving both strong privacy and high utility.

Method: Analyzed DP-SGD within the $f$-differential privacy framework, derived bounds on trade-off curves, separation $κ$, and noise multiplier $σ. Conducted theoretical analysis and experiments to validate findings.

Result: Derived strict lower bounds on the Gaussian noise multiplier $σ$ and showed that enforcing small privacy separations limits utility. Verified experimentally that these noise levels degrade training accuracy significantly.

Conclusion: DP-SGD under worst-case adversarial assumptions faces inherent limitations; it cannot achieve strong privacy and high utility simultaneously. This remains a bottleneck for practical training scenarios.

Abstract: Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) is the dominant paradigm for private training, but its fundamental limitations under worst-case adversarial privacy definitions remain poorly understood. We analyze DP-SGD in the $f$-differential privacy framework, which characterizes privacy via hypothesis-testing trade-off curves, and study shuffled sampling over a single epoch with $M$ gradient updates. We derive an explicit suboptimal upper bound on the achievable trade-off curve. This result induces a geometric lower bound on the separation $κ$ which is the maximum distance between the mechanism's trade-off curve and the ideal random-guessing line. Because a large separation implies significant adversarial advantage, meaningful privacy requires small $κ$. However, we prove that enforcing a small separation imposes a strict lower bound on the Gaussian noise multiplier $σ$, which directly limits the achievable utility. In particular, under the standard worst-case adversarial model, shuffled DP-SGD must satisfy
  $σ\ge \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\ln M}}$ $\quad\text{or}\quad$ $κ\ge\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{8}}\!\left(1-\frac{1}{\sqrt{4π\ln M}}\right)$,
  and thus cannot simultaneously achieve strong privacy and high utility. Although this bound vanishes asymptotically as $M \to \infty$, the convergence is extremely slow: even for practically relevant numbers of updates the required noise magnitude remains substantial. We further show that the same limitation extends to Poisson subsampling up to constant factors. Our experiments confirm that the noise levels implied by this bound leads to significant accuracy degradation at realistic training settings, thus showing a critical bottleneck in DP-SGD under standard worst-case adversarial assumptions.

### [247] [X-SAM: Boosting Sharpness-Aware Minimization with Dominant-Eigenvector Gradient Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10251)
*Hongru Duan,Yongle Chen,Lei Guan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAM's optimization can fail to meet expectations, as sharp and flat regions may have similar perturbed losses. X-SAM corrects this by aligning the gradient with the top eigenvector for improved regularization and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the shortcomings of SAM in improving generalization, particularly caused by gradient misalignment with sharp regions.

Method: Proposed and analyzed X-SAM, which uses the angle between gradient and Hessian's top eigenvector to correct gradient misalignment and enforce better sharpness regularization.

Result: Proved X-SAM's enhanced convergence and generalization while demonstrating its theoretical strength and practical improvements over SAM through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: X-SAM addresses the shortcomings of SAM by integrating spectral and geometric analysis, delivering improved optimization behavior and generalization performance.

Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) aims to improve generalization by minimizing a worst-case perturbed loss over a small neighborhood of model parameters. However, during training, its optimization behavior does not always align with theoretical expectations, since both sharp and flat regions may yield a small perturbed loss. In such cases, the gradient may still point toward sharp regions, failing to achieve the intended effect of SAM. To address this issue, we investigate SAM from a spectral and geometric perspective: specifically, we utilize the angle between the gradient and the leading eigenvector of the Hessian as a measure of sharpness. Our analysis illustrates that when this angle is less than or equal to ninety degrees, the effect of SAM's sharpness regularization can be weakened. Furthermore, we propose an explicit eigenvector-aligned SAM (X-SAM), which corrects the gradient via orthogonal decomposition along the top eigenvector, enabling more direct and efficient regularization of the Hessian's maximum eigenvalue. We prove X-SAM's convergence and superior generalization, with extensive experimental evaluations confirming both theoretical and practical advantages.

*Ziqiong Wang,Tianqi Ren,Rongpeng Li,Zhifeng Zhao,Honggang Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an In-Context Decoding (ICD) framework to improve Separate Source-Channel Coding (SSCC) in low SNR settings using a receiver-side enhancement method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SSCC, despite its modularity and compatibility with mature coders, is fragile in low SNR regimes, leading to catastrophic failures in lossless source decoding.

Method: The paper introduces the ICD framework, which utilizes an Error Correction Code Transformer (ECCT) for bit-wise reliability, constructs a candidate pool via reliability-based bit flipping, applies LLM-based arithmetic decoding, and selects outputs using a reliability-likelihood fusion rule.

Result: ICD demonstrates consistent performance gains over AWGN and Rayleigh fading channels compared to SSCC and Joint Source-Channel Coding baselines through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: Adding ICD to SSCC improves robustness without requiring changes to the transmitter, offering a practical solution for low SNR scenarios.

Abstract: Separate Source-Channel Coding (SSCC) remains attractive for text transmission due to its modularity and compatibility with mature entropy coders and powerful channel codes. However, SSCC often suffers from a pronounced cliff effect in low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) regimes, where residual bit errors after channel decoding can catastrophically break lossless source decoding, especially for Arithmetic Coding (AC) driven by Large Language Models (LLMs). This paper proposes a receiver-side In-Context Decoding (ICD) framework that enhances SSCC robustness without modifying the transmitter. ICD leverages an Error Correction Code Transformer (ECCT) to obtain bit-wise reliability for the decoded information bits. Based on the context-consistent bitstream, ICD constructs a confidence-ranked candidate pool via reliability-guided bit flipping, samples a compact yet diverse subset of candidates, and applies an LLM-based arithmetic decoder to obtain both reconstructions and sequence-level log-likelihoods. A reliability-likelihood fusion rule then selects the final output. We further provide theoretical guarantees on the stability and convergence of the proposed sampling procedure. Extensive experiments over Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and Rayleigh fading channels demonstrate consistent gains compared with conventional SSCC baselines and representative Joint Source-Channel Coding (JSCC) schemes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a robust, unsupervised system for detecting faults and monitoring turbofan engines without requiring extensive labeled datasets.

Method: Regression-based normalization removes operating condition effects, followed by LSTM autoencoder training on healthy trajectories. Persistent reconstruction error with adaptive thresholds triggers alerts in real-time.

Result: The approach achieved high recall and low false-alarm rates across various operating regimes and showcased scalability and prompt deployment.

Conclusion: The framework is effective as an unsupervised health-monitoring solution and complements existing life prediction models, enabling early fault detection.

Abstract: This paper introduces an unsupervised health-monitoring framework for turbofan engines that does not require run-to-failure labels. First, operating-condition effects in NASA CMAPSS sensor streams are removed via regression-based normalisation; then a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) autoencoder is trained only on the healthy portion of each trajectory. Persistent reconstruction error, estimated using an adaptive data-driven threshold, triggers real-time alerts without hand-tuned rules. Benchmark results show high recall and low false-alarm rates across multiple operating regimes, demonstrating that the method can be deployed quickly, scale to diverse fleets, and serve as a complementary early-warning layer to Remaining Useful Life models.

*Emre Ozbas,Melih Bastopcu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper develops an optimization framework for allocating tokens in a large language model server to balance query accuracy and latency under queue constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to optimize the resource allocation in LLM servers, which face diverse query types and computational costs, to improve efficiency without sacrificing performance.

Method: The authors propose a constrained optimization approach where the token allocation to queries is optimized to balance accuracy and response time under queue stability. Techniques include strict concavity analysis, fixed-point characterization, and projected gradient methods.

Result: The paper shows mathematical formulations ensuring existence and uniqueness of an optimal solution, and develops iterative methods to find the solution. Integer-valued token allocations are simulated to measure rounding effects.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively balances accuracy and latency in LLM server operations, providing optimal token distribution strategies while addressing computational constraints through simulation results.

Abstract: We consider a single large language model (LLM) server that serves a heterogeneous stream of queries belonging to $N$ distinct task types. Queries arrive according to a Poisson process, and each type occurs with a known prior probability. For each task type, the server allocates a fixed number of internal thinking tokens, which determines the computational effort devoted to that query. The token allocation induces an accuracy-latency trade-off: the service time follows an approximately affine function of the allocated tokens, while the probability of a correct response exhibits diminishing returns. Under a first-in, first-out (FIFO) service discipline, the system operates as an $M/G/1$ queue, and the mean system time depends on the first and second moments of the resulting service-time distribution. We formulate a constrained optimization problem that maximizes a weighted average accuracy objective penalized by the mean system time, subject to architectural token-budget constraints and queue-stability conditions. The objective function is shown to be strictly concave over the stability region, which ensures existence and uniqueness of the optimal token allocation. The first-order optimality conditions yield a coupled projected fixed-point characterization of the optimum, together with an iterative solution and an explicit sufficient condition for contraction. Moreover, a projected gradient method with a computable global step-size bound is developed to guarantee convergence beyond the contractive regime. Finally, integer-valued token allocations are attained via rounding of the continuous solution, and the resulting performance loss is evaluated in simulation results.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPIKE, a framework enhancing Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) using Koopman operators for better generalization and stability in solving differential equations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While PINNs effectively solve differential equations, they often overfit and struggle to generalize beyond the trained domain, necessitating improved methods for extrapolation and stability.

Method: The authors propose SPIKE, which incorporates continuous-time Koopman operators into PINNs, applying linear dynamics in an observable space. To ensure sparsity and parsimony, L1 regularization is added on the generator matrix.

Result: SPIKE improves temporal extrapolation, spatial generalization, and long-term prediction accuracy across various PDEs and ODEs. It also provides stable solutions for stiff systems.

Conclusion: SPIKE enhances PINNs through regularization with Koopman operators, yielding sparse and stable dynamic representations, and broadens their applicability to complex differential systems.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) provide a mesh-free approach for solving differential equations by embedding physical constraints into neural network training. However, PINNs tend to overfit within the training domain, leading to poor generalization when extrapolating beyond trained spatiotemporal regions. This work presents SPIKE (Sparse Physics-Informed Koopman-Enhanced), a framework that regularizes PINNs with continuous-time Koopman operators to learn parsimonious dynamics representations. By enforcing linear dynamics $dz/dt = Az$ in a learned observable space, both PIKE (without explicit sparsity) and SPIKE (with L1 regularization on $A$) learn sparse generator matrices, embodying the parsimony principle that complex dynamics admit low-dimensional structure. Experiments across parabolic, hyperbolic, dispersive, and stiff PDEs, including fluid dynamics (Navier-Stokes) and chaotic ODEs (Lorenz), demonstrate consistent improvements in temporal extrapolation, spatial generalization, and long-term prediction accuracy. The continuous-time formulation with matrix exponential integration provides unconditional stability for stiff systems while avoiding diagonal dominance issues inherent in discrete-time Koopman operators.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DualCD, a framework enhancing time series classification under domain incremental scenarios by disentangling causal features and mitigating confounding effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving time series classification in domain incremental scenarios, which current studies struggle with.

Method: A lightweight dual-causal disentanglement framework that uses feature disentanglement and a dual-causal intervention mechanism to isolate and leverage class-causal features.

Result: Tests on multiple datasets show that DualCD enhances performance in domain incremental learning.

Conclusion: DualCD is effective for robust time series classification in dynamic domain settings, validated by comprehensive experiments and benchmarks.

Abstract: The World Wide Web thrives on intelligent services that rely on accurate time series classification, which has recently witnessed significant progress driven by advances in deep learning. However, existing studies face challenges in domain incremental learning. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and robust dual-causal disentanglement framework (DualCD) to enhance the robustness of models under domain incremental scenarios, which can be seamlessly integrated into time series classification models. Specifically, DualCD first introduces a temporal feature disentanglement module to capture class-causal features and spurious features. The causal features can offer sufficient predictive power to support the classifier in domain incremental learning settings. To accurately capture these causal features, we further design a dual-causal intervention mechanism to eliminate the influence of both intra-class and inter-class confounding features. This mechanism constructs variant samples by combining the current class's causal features with intra-class spurious features and with causal features from other classes. The causal intervention loss encourages the model to accurately predict the labels of these variant samples based solely on the causal features. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and models demonstrate that DualCD effectively improves performance in domain incremental scenarios. We summarize our rich experiments into a comprehensive benchmark to facilitate research in domain incremental time series classification.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the limitations in current traffic flow predictions by proposing Meta Dynamic Graph (MetaDG), which uses dynamic graph structures to enhance spatio-temporal modeling and effectively predicts traffic flow.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve traffic flow predictions by addressing complex spatio-temporal dependencies and overcoming limitations in modeling dynamics and heterogeneity.

Method: The framework, MetaDG, utilizes dynamic graph structures that generate dynamic adjacency matrices and meta-parameters to model spatio-temporal dynamics and unify heterogeneity modeling.

Result: Extensive experiments conducted on four real-world datasets confirm MetaDG's effectiveness in traffic prediction tasks.

Conclusion: MetaDG advances spatio-temporal modeling by addressing key challenges in traffic flow prediction, providing improved accuracy and utility.

Abstract: Traffic flow prediction is a typical spatio-temporal prediction problem and has a wide range of applications. The core challenge lies in modeling the underlying complex spatio-temporal dependencies. Various methods have been proposed, and recent studies show that the modeling of dynamics is useful to meet the core challenge. While handling spatial dependencies and temporal dependencies using separate base model structures may hinder the modeling of spatio-temporal correlations, the modeling of dynamics can bridge this gap. Incorporating spatio-temporal heterogeneity also advances the main goal, since it can extend the parameter space and allow more flexibility. Despite these advances, two limitations persist: 1) the modeling of dynamics is often limited to the dynamics of spatial topology (e.g., adjacency matrix changes), which, however, can be extended to a broader scope; 2) the modeling of heterogeneity is often separated for spatial and temporal dimensions, but this gap can also be bridged by the modeling of dynamics. To address the above limitations, we propose a novel framework for traffic prediction, called Meta Dynamic Graph (MetaDG). MetaDG leverages dynamic graph structures of node representations to explicitly model spatio-temporal dynamics. This generates both dynamic adjacency matrices and meta-parameters, extending dynamic modeling beyond topology while unifying the capture of spatio-temporal heterogeneity into a single dimension. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of MetaDG.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Strategy-aware Surprise (SuS), a reinforcement learning framework enhancing exploration by combining strategy stability and surprise predictions, achieving superior performance in mathematical reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve exploration efficiency in reinforcement learning by addressing the limitations of traditional curiosity-driven methods that rely solely on state prediction error.

Method: The method combines two novel components: Strategy Stability (measuring consistency of behavioral strategy) and Strategy Surprise (capturing unexpected outcomes). These are integrated through a weighted reward formulation to guide exploration.

Result: Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate SuS achieves up to 17.4% improvement in Pass@1 and 26.4% in Pass@5 compared to baselines, along with higher strategy diversity.

Conclusion: SuS offers a powerful exploration strategy by synergizing strategy stability and surprise signals, proving its effectiveness in improving reasoning performance and diversity in solutions.

Abstract: We propose Strategy-aware Surprise (SuS), a novel intrinsic motivation framework that uses pre-post prediction mismatch as a novelty signal for exploration in reinforcement learning. Unlike traditional curiosity-driven methods that rely solely on state prediction error, SuS introduces two complementary components: Strategy Stability (SS) and Strategy Surprise (SuS). SS measures consistency in behavioral strategy across temporal steps, while SuS captures unexpected outcomes relative to the agent's current strategy representation. Our combined reward formulation leverages both signals through learned weighting coefficients. We evaluate SuS on mathematical reasoning tasks using large language models, demonstrating significant improvements in both accuracy and solution diversity. Ablation studies confirm that removing either component results in at least 10% performance degradation, validating the synergistic nature of our approach. SuS achieves 17.4% improvement in Pass@1 and 26.4% improvement in Pass@5 compared to baseline methods, while maintaining higher strategy diversity throughout training.

Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of physiologically plausible, diverse, and interpretable counterfactual explanations in time-series extrinsic regression models, which are critical for building trust with clinicians and improving clinical decision-making.

Method: EvoMorph is a multi-objective evolutionary framework that optimizes physiologically plausible objectives for counterfactual generation in time-series data, particularly focusing on maintaining waveform morphology and applying transformations to ensure interpretability.

Result: EvoMorph outperformed a baseline method in generating physiologically plausible and diverse counterfactuals across three PPG datasets. It also demonstrated potential in quantifying uncertainty in a case study with bootstrap-ensemble uncertainty comparisons.

Conclusion: EvoMorph advances model interpretability and trustworthiness in clinical applications, enabling better understanding of counterfactual scenarios and uncertainty in time-series extrinsic regression models.

Abstract: Wearable devices enable continuous, population-scale monitoring of physiological signals, such as photoplethysmography (PPG), creating new opportunities for data-driven clinical assessment. Time-series extrinsic regression (TSER) models increasingly leverage PPG signals to estimate clinically relevant outcomes, including heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. For clinical reasoning and trust, however, single point estimates alone are insufficient: clinicians must also understand whether predictions are stable under physiologically plausible variations and to what extent realistic, attainable changes in physiological signals would meaningfully alter a model's prediction. Counterfactual explanations (CFE) address these "what-if" questions, yet existing time series CFE generation methods are largely restricted to classification, overlook waveform morphology, and often produce physiologically implausible signals, limiting their applicability to continuous biomedical time series. To address these limitations, we introduce EvoMorph, a multi-objective evolutionary framework for generating physiologically plausible and diverse CFE for TSER applications. EvoMorph optimizes morphology-aware objectives defined on interpretable signal descriptors and applies transformations to preserve the waveform structure. We evaluated EvoMorph on three PPG datasets (heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation) against a nearest-unlike-neighbor baseline. In addition, in a case study, we evaluated EvoMorph as a tool for uncertainty quantification by relating counterfactual sensitivity to bootstrap-ensemble uncertainty and data-density measures. Overall, EvoMorph enables the generation of physiologically-aware counterfactuals for continuous biomedical signals and supports uncertainty-aware interpretability, advancing trustworthy model analysis for clinical time-series applications.

*Jay Nandy,Arnab Kumar Mondal,Anuj Rathore,Mahesh Chandran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PLGC, a self-supervised framework for graph condensation that does not require clean labels, making it robust against label noise and inconsistencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of existing graph condensation methods which depend on clean, supervised labels, making them unreliable in noisy, weakly-labeled, or inconsistent environments.

Method: PLGC constructs pseudo-labels using node embeddings and optimizes condensed graphs to retain the original graph's structural and feature statistics, without requiring ground-truth labels.

Result: PLGC demonstrates competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods on clean datasets for node classification and link prediction tasks, while showing significant robustness under label noise.

Conclusion: PLGC provides practical and theoretical advancements in self-supervised graph condensation, particularly in environments with noisy or scarce labels.

Abstract: Large graph datasets make training graph neural networks (GNNs) computationally costly. Graph condensation methods address this by generating small synthetic graphs that approximate the original data. However, existing approaches rely on clean, supervised labels, which limits their reliability when labels are scarce, noisy, or inconsistent. We propose Pseudo-Labeled Graph Condensation (PLGC), a self-supervised framework that constructs latent pseudo-labels from node embeddings and optimizes condensed graphs to match the original graph's structural and feature statistics -- without requiring ground-truth labels. PLGC offers three key contributions: (1) A diagnosis of why supervised condensation fails under label noise and distribution shift. (2) A label-free condensation method that jointly learns latent prototypes and node assignments. (3) Theoretical guarantees showing that pseudo-labels preserve latent structural statistics of the original graph and ensure accurate embedding alignment. Empirically, across node classification and link prediction tasks, PLGC achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art supervised condensation methods on clean datasets and exhibits substantial robustness under label noise, often outperforming all baselines by a significant margin. Our findings highlight the practical and theoretical advantages of self-supervised graph condensation in noisy or weakly-labeled environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Discrete Feynman-Kac Correctors, a framework for controlled generation of discrete sequences in diffusion models, without requiring additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to enable flexible control over the generated distribution of discrete diffusion models during inference, to expand their applicability and utility.

Method: The proposed framework derives Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithms that allow for tasks like annealing, handling differently conditioned processes, and integrating external reward functions with discrete diffusion models.

Result: The framework effectively applies to tasks such as sampling from annealed Boltzmann distributions, enhancing language models for code generation, amortized learning, and reward-tilted protein sequence generation.

Conclusion: Discrete Feynman-Kac Correctors enhance the utility of diffusion models by enabling controlled and reward-influenced sampling without extra training.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have recently emerged as a promising alternative to the autoregressive approach for generating discrete sequences. Sample generation via gradual denoising or demasking processes allows them to capture hierarchical non-sequential interdependencies in the data. These custom processes, however, do not assume a flexible control over the distribution of generated samples. We propose Discrete Feynman-Kac Correctors, a framework that allows for controlling the generated distribution of discrete masked diffusion models at inference time. We derive Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithms that, given a trained discrete diffusion model, control the temperature of the sampled distribution (i.e. perform annealing), sample from the product of marginals of several diffusion processes (e.g. differently conditioned processes), and sample from the product of the marginal with an external reward function, producing likely samples from the target distribution that also have high reward. Notably, our framework does not require any training of additional models or fine-tuning of the original model. We illustrate the utility of our framework in several applications including: efficient sampling from the annealed Boltzmann distribution of the Ising model, improving the performance of language models for code generation and amortized learning, as well as reward-tilted protein sequence generation.

*Yuanjie Zhao,Junnan Qiu,Yue Ding,Jie Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces CS-GBA, a stealthy and efficient backdoor attack method for offline reinforcement learning, demonstrating high effectiveness under tight budgets while evading detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vulnerability of offline reinforcement learning to backdoor attacks and improve the stealth and effectiveness of attacks against safety-constrained algorithms.

Method: CS-GBA includes (1) adaptive Critical Sample Selection for budget efficiency, (2) Correlation-Breaking Triggers to evade detection, and (3) Gradient-Guided Action Generation to identify destructive actions using a victim Q-network's gradient.

Result: Empirical evaluations on D4RL benchmarks show that CS-GBA significantly improves attack success rates against safety-constrained algorithms at minimal poisoning levels, while retaining the agent's clean environment performance.

Conclusion: CS-GBA presents a novel and targeted approach for conducting backdoor attacks in offline RL, balancing both stealth and destructiveness effectively.

Abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables policy optimization from static datasets but is inherently vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Existing attack strategies typically struggle against safety-constrained algorithms (e.g., CQL) due to inefficient random poisoning and the use of easily detectable Out-of-Distribution (OOD) triggers. In this paper, we propose CS-GBA (Critical Sample-based Gradient-guided Backdoor Attack), a novel framework designed to achieve high stealthiness and destructiveness under a strict budget. Leveraging the theoretical insight that samples with high Temporal Difference (TD) errors are pivotal for value function convergence, we introduce an adaptive Critical Sample Selection strategy that concentrates the attack budget on the most influential transitions. To evade OOD detection, we propose a Correlation-Breaking Trigger mechanism that exploits the physical mutual exclusivity of state features (e.g., 95th percentile boundaries) to remain statistically concealed. Furthermore, we replace the conventional label inversion with a Gradient-Guided Action Generation mechanism, which searches for worst-case actions within the data manifold using the victim Q-network's gradient. Empirical results on D4RL benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving high attack success rates against representative safety-constrained algorithms with a minimal 5% poisoning budget, while maintaining the agent's performance in clean environments.

TL;DR: DeFlow is an offline RL framework utilizing flow matching to model complex behaviors while maintaining efficiency and generative expressivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address computational inefficiency and instability in generative policy optimization via traditional backpropagation through ODE solvers.

Method: DeFlow introduces a lightweight refinement module within a trust region of the flow manifold, bypassing solver differentiation and avoiding single-step distillation.

Result: DeFlow outperforms competing methods on the OGBench benchmark and supports efficient offline-to-online adaptation.

Conclusion: DeFlow ensures stable policy improvement while preserving the iterative generative capabilities of flow models, showing promise for complex offline RL tasks.

Abstract: We present DeFlow, a decoupled offline RL framework that leverages flow matching to faithfully capture complex behavior manifolds. Optimizing generative policies is computationally prohibitive, typically necessitating backpropagation through ODE solvers. We address this by learning a lightweight refinement module within an explicit, data-derived trust region of the flow manifold, rather than sacrificing the iterative generation capability via single-step distillation. This way, we bypass solver differentiation and eliminate the need for balancing loss terms, ensuring stable improvement while fully preserving the flow's iterative expressivity. Empirically, DeFlow achieves superior performance on the challenging OGBench benchmark and demonstrates efficient offline-to-online adaptation.

*Shenlong Zheng,Zhen Zhang,Yuhui Deng,Geyong Min,Lin Cui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GradESTC is a spatio-temporal gradient compression technique for federated learning that reduces communication overhead while preserving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of communication overhead in federated learning, especially in bandwidth-constrained networks.

Method: GradESTC decomposes gradients into basis vectors and coefficients, exploiting spatial correlations, and only updates a small subset of basis vectors using temporal correlations.

Result: GradESTC reduces uplink communication by 39.79% on average compared to the strongest baseline while maintaining similar convergence speed and final accuracy to uncompressed FedAvg.

Conclusion: GradESTC provides a practical and scalable solution to reduce communication costs in federated learning through spatio-temporal gradient structures.

Abstract: Communication overhead is a critical challenge in federated learning, particularly in bandwidth-constrained networks. Although many methods have been proposed to reduce communication overhead, most focus solely on compressing individual gradients, overlooking the temporal correlations among them. Prior studies have shown that gradients exhibit spatial correlations, typically reflected in low-rank structures. Through empirical analysis, we further observe a strong temporal correlation between client gradients across adjacent rounds. Based on these observations, we propose GradESTC, a compression technique that exploits both spatial and temporal gradient correlations. GradESTC exploits spatial correlations to decompose each full gradient into a compact set of basis vectors and corresponding combination coefficients. By exploiting temporal correlations, only a small portion of the basis vectors need to be dynamically updated in each round. GradESTC significantly reduces communication overhead by transmitting lightweight combination coefficients and a limited number of updated basis vectors instead of the full gradients. Extensive experiments show that, upon reaching a target accuracy level near convergence, GradESTC reduces uplink communication by an average of 39.79% compared to the strongest baseline, while maintaining comparable convergence speed and final accuracy to uncompressed FedAvg. By effectively leveraging spatio-temporal gradient structures, GradESTC offers a practical and scalable solution for communication-efficient federated learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address issues like entropy collapse and lack of stability in current proximal policy update methods for fine-tuning large language models.

Method: PROMA accumulates policy gradients across microbatches using layer-wise projections during the backward pass, avoiding extra computation steps.

Result: PROMA provides tighter KL divergence control and more stable policy learning compared to GRPO, without entropy collapse or dependence on techniques like likelihood-ratio clipping.

Conclusion: PROMA is an effective alternative method for achieving proximal updates in large language model fine-tuning.

Abstract: This note introduces Projected Microbatch Accumulation (PROMA), a proximal policy update method for large language model fine-tuning. PROMA accumulates policy gradients across microbatches by projecting out sequence-wise gradient components before microbatch aggregation. The projection is applied layer-wise during the backward pass, enabling efficient implementation without additional forward or backward passes. Empirically, PROMA enforces tighter control of local KL divergence than GRPO, resulting in more stable policy learning. Unlike PPO and GRPO, PROMA achieves proximal updates without inducing entropy collapse and does not rely on a reference policy or likelihood-ratio clipping.

Method: A GPT-2 architecture is trained on existing modulation datasets to generate new modulation schemes. The novel schemes are evaluated using metrics like Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and Power Spectrum Density (PSD).

Result: The Transformer-generated modulation schemes achieve comparable or better performance relative to traditional methods, as measured by key metrics such as SNR and PSD.

Conclusion: Implementing Transformer models, specifically GPT-2, could significantly enhance the efficiency, robustness, and security of Cognitive Radio systems.

Abstract: Cognitive Radio (CR) systems, which dynamically adapt to changing spectrum environments, could benefit significantly from advancements in machine learning technologies. These systems can be enhanced in terms of spectral efficiency, robustness, and security through innovative approaches such as the use of Transformer models. This work investigates the application of Transformer models, specifically the GPT-2 architecture, to generate novel modulation schemes for wireless communications. By training a GPT-2 model on a dataset of existing modulation formulas, new modulation schemes has been created. These generated schemes are then compared to traditional methods using key performance metrics such as Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and Power Spectrum Density (PSD). The results show that Transformer-generated modulation schemes can achieve performance comparable to, and in some cases outperforming, traditional methods. This demonstrates that advanced CR systems could greatly benefit from the implementation of Transformer models, leading to more efficient, robust, and secure communication systems.

*Niffa Cheick Oumar Diaby,Thierry Duchesne,Mario Marchand*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method for developing interpretable machine learning models by using mixtures of transparent local models, ensuring transparency and competitiveness compared to certain opaque models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing reliance on machine learning across various domains has created a demand for transparency in models, particularly to address concerns like security and non-discrimination.

Method: A mixture of transparent local models is introduced to capture regions of the input space where simple labeling functions are effective. A multi-locality loss function with PAC-Bayesian risk bounds is employed for binary linear classification and linear regression.

Result: Experimental results using synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is competitive compared to existing approaches, including opaque models.

Conclusion: Transparent local models can effectively balance interpretability and performance, providing a viable alternative to less transparent algorithms in machine learning tasks.

Abstract: The predominance of machine learning models in many spheres of human activity has led to a growing demand for their transparency. The transparency of models makes it possible to discern some factors, such as security or non-discrimination. In this paper, we propose a mixture of transparent local models as an alternative solution for designing interpretable (or transparent) models. Our approach is designed for the situations where a simple and transparent function is suitable for modeling the label of instances in some localities/regions of the input space, but may change abruptly as we move from one locality to another. Consequently, the proposed algorithm is to learn both the transparent labeling function and the locality of the input space where the labeling function achieves a small risk in its assigned locality. By using a new multi-predictor (and multi-locality) loss function, we established rigorous PAC-Bayesian risk bounds for the case of binary linear classification problem and that of linear regression. In both cases, synthetic data sets were used to illustrate how the learning algorithms work. The results obtained from real data sets highlight the competitiveness of our approach compared to other existing methods as well as certain opaque models. Keywords: PAC-Bayes, risk bounds, local models, transparent models, mixtures of local transparent models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Concept Bottleneck Models overlook domain-specific causal relationships and rely heavily on complete concept labeling, limiting their applicability in scientific scenarios with sparse labels but well-defined processes.

Method: The proposed PG-CBM introduces biophysically meaningful intermediate concepts constrained by domain-specific causal mechanisms to improve training using heterogeneous data.

Result: PG-CBM reduces error and bias compared to benchmarks, enhances interpretability, transparency, and scientific insights, and enables detection of spurious learning.

Conclusion: PG-CBM represents a significant step toward trustworthy AI systems for scientific applications by balancing better accuracy with improved explainability and domain-specific reliability.

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) improve the explainability of black-box Deep Learning (DL) by introducing intermediate semantic concepts. However, standard CBMs often overlook domain-specific relationships and causal mechanisms, and their dependence on complete concept labels limits applicability in scientific domains where supervision is sparse but processes are well defined. To address this, we propose the Process-Guided Concept Bottleneck Model (PG-CBM), an extension of CBMs which constrains learning to follow domain-defined causal mechanisms through biophysically meaningful intermediate concepts. Using above ground biomass density estimation from Earth Observation data as a case study, we show that PG-CBM reduces error and bias compared to multiple benchmarks, whilst leveraging multi-source heterogeneous training data and producing interpretable intermediate outputs. Beyond improved accuracy, PG-CBM enhances transparency, enables detection of spurious learning, and provides scientific insights, representing a step toward more trustworthy AI systems in scientific applications.

Conclusion: KANs are highly effective, offering better accuracy and lower computational costs than MLPs, ideal for real-time and resource-limited scenarios while advancing neural network application paradigms.

Abstract: The research undertakes a comprehensive comparative analysis of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP), highlighting their effectiveness in solving essential computational challenges like nonlinear function approximation, time-series prediction, and multivariate classification. Rooted in Kolmogorov's representation theorem, KANs utilize adaptive spline-based activation functions and grid-based structures, providing a transformative approach compared to traditional neural network frameworks. Utilizing a variety of datasets spanning mathematical function estimation (quadratic and cubic) to practical uses like predicting daily temperatures and categorizing wines, the proposed research thoroughly assesses model performance via accuracy measures like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and computational expense assessed through Floating Point Operations (FLOPs). The results indicate that KANs reliably exceed MLPs in every benchmark, attaining higher predictive accuracy with significantly reduced computational costs. Such an outcome highlights their ability to maintain a balance between computational efficiency and accuracy, rendering them especially beneficial in resource-limited and real-time operational environments. By elucidating the architectural and functional distinctions between KANs and MLPs, the paper provides a systematic framework for selecting the most suitable neural architectures for specific tasks. Furthermore, the proposed study highlights the transformative capabilities of KANs in progressing intelligent systems, influencing their use in situations that require both interpretability and computational efficiency.

We introduce a unifying framework for COAML pipelines, describe their methodological building blocks, and formalize their connection to empirical cost minimization. We then develop a taxonomy of problem settings based on the form of uncertainty and decision structure. Using this taxonomy, we review algorithmic approaches for static and dynamic problems, survey applications across domains such as scheduling, vehicle routing, stochastic programming, and reinforcement learning, and synthesize methodological contributions in terms of empirical cost minimization, imitation learning, and reinforcement learning. Finally, we identify key research frontiers. This survey aims to serve both as a tutorial introduction to the field and as a roadmap for future research at the interface of combinatorial optimization and machine learning.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ProbFM, a new transformer-based probabilistic framework leveraging Deep Evidential Regression (DER) for principled uncertainty quantification in time-series financial forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) for financial forecasting struggle with uncertainty quantification due to restrictive approaches, conflated uncertainties, or poor calibration mechanisms.

Method: ProbFM employs Deep Evidential Regression (DER) to achieve explicit epistemic-aleatoric uncertainty decomposition without requiring pre-specified distributions or sampling-based inference.

Result: Evaluation on cryptocurrency return forecasting shows ProbFM provides competitive forecasting accuracy along with principled uncertainty decomposition compared to five probabilistic methods.

Conclusion: The study establishes ProbFM and DER as effective tools for principled uncertainty quantification in financial forecasting, offering theoretical advantages and transferability.

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have emerged as a promising approach for zero-shot financial forecasting, demonstrating strong transferability and data efficiency gains. However, their adoption in financial applications is hindered by fundamental limitations in uncertainty quantification: current approaches either rely on restrictive distributional assumptions, conflate different sources of uncertainty, or lack principled calibration mechanisms. While recent TSFMs employ sophisticated techniques such as mixture models, Student's t-distributions, or conformal prediction, they fail to address the core challenge of providing theoretically-grounded uncertainty decomposition. For the very first time, we present a novel transformer-based probabilistic framework, ProbFM (probabilistic foundation model), that leverages Deep Evidential Regression (DER) to provide principled uncertainty quantification with explicit epistemic-aleatoric decomposition. Unlike existing approaches that pre-specify distributional forms or require sampling-based inference, ProbFM learns optimal uncertainty representations through higher-order evidence learning while maintaining single-pass computational efficiency. To rigorously evaluate the core DER uncertainty quantification approach independent of architectural complexity, we conduct an extensive controlled comparison study using a consistent LSTM architecture across five probabilistic methods: DER, Gaussian NLL, Student's-t NLL, Quantile Loss, and Conformal Prediction. Evaluation on cryptocurrency return forecasting demonstrates that DER maintains competitive forecasting accuracy while providing explicit epistemic-aleatoric uncertainty decomposition. This work establishes both an extensible framework for principled uncertainty quantification in foundation models and empirical evidence for DER's effectiveness in financial applications.

TL;DR: STEM introduces a static, token-indexed embedding module replacing FFN up-projection, improving training stability, efficiency, interpretability, and downstream performance in sparse transformer models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-grained sparsity in transformer models offers potential benefits, but it struggles with issues like instability, load balancing, and high communication overhead.

Method: STEM uses token-indexed embedding lookups to replace FFN up-projection, while retaining dense gates and down-projections. It avoids runtime routing and reduces communication overhead, improving efficiency and stability.

Result: STEM achieves better training stability, interpretability, and efficiency. It improves accuracy up to ~3-4% across models, enhancing capacity for long-context tasks and knowledge-focused benchmarks.

Conclusion: STEM effectively scales parametric memory by optimizing sparsity, resolving key issues in sparse models. It improves interpretability, training stability, efficiency, and downstream task performance.

Abstract: Fine-grained sparsity promises higher parametric capacity without proportional per-token compute, but often suffers from training instability, load balancing, and communication overhead. We introduce STEM (Scaling Transformers with Embedding Modules), a static, token-indexed approach that replaces the FFN up-projection with a layer-local embedding lookup while keeping the gate and down-projection dense. This removes runtime routing, enables CPU offload with asynchronous prefetch, and decouples capacity from both per-token FLOPs and cross-device communication. Empirically, STEM trains stably despite extreme sparsity. It improves downstream performance over dense baselines while reducing per-token FLOPs and parameter accesses (eliminating roughly one-third of FFN parameters). STEM learns embedding spaces with large angular spread which enhances its knowledge storage capacity. More interestingly, this enhanced knowledge capacity comes with better interpretability. The token-indexed nature of STEM embeddings allows simple ways to perform knowledge editing and knowledge injection in an interpretable manner without any intervention in the input text or additional computation. In addition, STEM strengthens long-context performance: as sequence length grows, more distinct parameters are activated, yielding practical test-time capacity scaling. Across 350M and 1B model scales, STEM delivers up to ~3--4% accuracy improvements overall, with notable gains on knowledge and reasoning-heavy benchmarks (ARC-Challenge, OpenBookQA, GSM8K, MMLU). Overall, STEM is an effective way of scaling parametric memory while providing better interpretability, better training stability and improved efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High network bandwidth bottlenecks in training and serving Large Language Models due to frequent collective operations.

Method: The paper proposes eliminating Huffman coding overheads by using fixed codebooks derived from average probability distributions of previous data batches.

Result: The proposed approach achieves compression within 0.5% of per-shard Huffman coding and 1% of Shannon compressibility.

Conclusion: The single-stage encoding method efficiently tackles bandwidth issues in LLMs with minimal computational and latency overheads.

Abstract: Training and serving Large Language Models (LLMs) require partitioning data across multiple accelerators, where collective operations are frequently bottlenecked by network bandwidth. Lossless compression using Huffman codes is an effective way to alleviate the issue, however, its three-stage design requiring on-the-fly frequency analysis, codebook generation and transmission of codebook along with data introduces computational, latency and data overheads which are prohibitive for latency-sensitive scenarios such as die-to-die communication. This paper proposes a single-stage Huffman encoder that eliminates these overheads by using fixed codebooks derived from the average probability distribution of previous data batches. Through our analysis of the Gemma 2B model, we demonstrate that tensors exhibit high statistical similarity across layers and shards. Using this approach we achieve compression within 0.5% of per-shard Huffman coding and within 1% of the ideal Shannon compressibility, enabling efficient on-the-fly compression.

Motivation: Modeling complex systems under stochastic and varying conditions is computationally expensive, and existing reduced-order models fail in robustness and uncertainty quantification.

Method: A data-driven approach employing amortized stochastic variational inference and Markov Gaussian processes to jointly learn a probabilistic autoencoder and stochastic differential equations governing latent dynamics.

Result: The framework generalizes well to unseen parameter combinations and forcings, and achieves significant computational efficiency compared to traditional approaches.

Conclusion: This novel framework advances the modeling of complex systems with improved scalability, generalization across conditions, and potential for integrating physics-based constraints when available.

Abstract: Modeling complex dynamical systems under varying conditions is computationally intensive, often rendering high-fidelity simulations intractable. Although reduced-order models (ROMs) offer a promising solution, current methods often struggle with stochastic dynamics and fail to quantify prediction uncertainty, limiting their utility in robust decision-making contexts. To address these challenges, we introduce a data-driven framework for learning continuous-time stochastic ROMs that generalize across parameter spaces and forcing conditions. Our approach, based on amortized stochastic variational inference, leverages a reparametrization trick for Markov Gaussian processes to eliminate the need for computationally expensive forward solvers during training. This enables us to jointly learn a probabilistic autoencoder and stochastic differential equations governing the latent dynamics, at a computational cost that is independent of the dataset size and system stiffness. Additionally, our approach offers the flexibility of incorporating physics-informed priors if available. Numerical studies are presented for three challenging test problems, where we demonstrate excellent generalization to unseen parameter combinations and forcings, and significant efficiency gains compared to existing approaches.

Motivation: To enhance federated learning by simultaneously addressing communication efficiency and privacy protection under stringent data-governance constraints.

Method: CEPAM uses the Rejection-Sampled Universal Quantizer (RSUQ) for randomized vector quantization, which ensures adjustable privacy levels while maintaining communication efficiency.

Result: CEPAM demonstrates privacy guarantees, convergence properties, and efficient utility performance in experimental evaluations, outperforming baselines and achieving balanced accuracy-privacy trade-offs.

Conclusion: CEPAM offers a practical mechanism for privacy-preserving federated learning, achieving both communication efficiency and adaptable privacy, validated theoretically and experimentally.

Abstract: Federated learning enables multiple parties to jointly train learning models without sharing their own underlying data, offering a practical pathway to privacy-preserving collaboration under data-governance constraints. Continued study of federated learning is essential to address key challenges in it, including communication efficiency and privacy protection between parties. A recent line of work introduced a novel approach called the Communication-Efficient and Privacy-Adaptable Mechanism (CEPAM), which achieves both objectives simultaneously. CEPAM leverages the rejection-sampled universal quantizer (RSUQ), a randomized vector quantizer whose quantization error is equivalent to a prescribed noise, which can be tuned to customize privacy protection between parties. In this work, we theoretically analyze the privacy guarantees and convergence properties of CEPAM. Moreover, we assess CEPAM's utility performance through experimental evaluations, including convergence profiles compared with other baselines, and accuracy-privacy trade-offs between different parties.

### [272] [Distributed Perceptron under Bounded Staleness, Partial Participation, and Noisy Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10705)
*Keval Jain,Anant Raj,Saurav Prakash,Girish Varma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines a semi-asynchronous client-server perceptron with iterative parameter mixing, focusing on three effects: staleness, partial participation, and communication noise. Key results include bounds on perceptron mistakes under specific conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address system effects like delays, intermittent participation, and noise in federated and distributed learning and understand their impact on perceptron performance.

Method: Utilizes an iterative parameter mixing (IPM) scheme with a novel staleness-bucket aggregation rule to manage update delays deterministically, without relying on stochastic delay models.

Result: Provides a finite-horizon bound on perceptron mistake numbers, showing that delay impacts through mean staleness and communication noise adds a term growing with horizon and noise energy.

Conclusion: The method accommodates real-world deployment issues, ensuring finite stabilization bounds under specific conditions, showing robustness to staleness and noise.

Abstract: We study a semi-asynchronous client-server perceptron trained via iterative parameter mixing (IPM-style averaging): clients run local perceptron updates and a server forms a global model by aggregating the updates that arrive in each communication round. The setting captures three system effects in federated and distributed deployments: (i) stale updates due to delayed model delivery and delayed application of client computations (two-sided version lag), (ii) partial participation (intermittent client availability), and (iii) imperfect communication on both downlink and uplink, modeled as effective zero-mean additive noise with bounded second moment. We introduce a server-side aggregation rule called staleness-bucket aggregation with padding that deterministically enforces a prescribed staleness profile over update ages without assuming any stochastic model for delays or participation. Under margin separability and bounded data radius, we prove a finite-horizon expected bound on the cumulative weighted number of perceptron mistakes over a given number of server rounds: the impact of delay appears only through the mean enforced staleness, whereas communication noise contributes an additional term that grows on the order of the square root of the horizon with the total noise energy. In the noiseless case, we show how a finite expected mistake budget yields an explicit finite-round stabilization bound under a mild fresh-participation condition.

*Khashayar Gatmiry,Sitan Chen,Adil Salim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new solver for diffusion models with improved efficiency, offering polylogarithmic iteration complexity in inverse accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiency in generating high-quality samples using diffusion models, which traditionally require many iterations due to reliance on discretization.

Method: Develop a solver based on low-degree approximation and the collocation method, ensuring polylogarithmic scaling in terms of inverse accuracy.

Result: Achieved high-accuracy guarantees for diffusion-based sampling, with iteration complexity dependent on effective radius of the target distribution instead of ambient dimension.

Conclusion: The proposed approach improves accuracy and efficiency in diffusion-based sampling through innovative numerical techniques, avoiding dependence on ambient dimension directly.

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable empirical success in sampling from rich multi-modal distributions. Their inference relies on numerically solving a certain differential equation. This differential equation cannot be solved in closed form, and its resolution via discretization typically requires many small iterations to produce \emph{high-quality} samples.
  More precisely, prior works have shown that the iteration complexity of discretization methods for diffusion models scales polynomially in the ambient dimension and the inverse accuracy $1/\varepsilon$. In this work, we propose a new solver for diffusion models relying on a subtle interplay between low-degree approximation and the collocation method (Lee, Song, Vempala 2018), and we prove that its iteration complexity scales \emph{polylogarithmically} in $1/\varepsilon$, yielding the first ``high-accuracy'' guarantee for a diffusion-based sampler that only uses (approximate) access to the scores of the data distribution. In addition, our bound does not depend explicitly on the ambient dimension; more precisely, the dimension affects the complexity of our solver through the \emph{effective radius} of the support of the target distribution only.

*Navami Kairanda,Shanthika Naik,Marc Habermann,Avinash Sharma,Christian Theobalt,Vladislav Golyanik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces DInf-Grid, a novel differentiable grid-based representation for solving differential equations, which is faster and maintains high accuracy compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Coordinate-based MLP architectures for solving differential equations are both computationally heavy and slow to train. Existing grid-based methods are more efficient but lack the ability to compute higher-order derivatives, making them incompatible for solving differential equations. The need is to develop a representation that is both efficient and capable of higher-order derivative computation.

Method: The authors propose DInf-Grid, which combines feature grids with radial basis function interpolation to achieve infinite differentiability. A multi-resolution decomposition with co-located grids is introduced to capture high-frequency solutions and ensure stable global gradient computation. Training is performed implicitly through the use of differential equations as loss functions.

Result: DInf-Grid demonstrates up to a 5-20x speed-up over existing coordinate-based MLP methods. It solves differential equations accurately in seconds or minutes while maintaining compactness and comparable precision.

Conclusion: The proposed DInf-Grid framework efficiently solves differential equations by overcoming limitations of previous methods, offering significant computational speed-up and accurate modelling of physical fields across various tasks.

Abstract: We present a novel differentiable grid-based representation for efficiently solving differential equations (DEs). Widely used architectures for neural solvers, such as sinusoidal neural networks, are coordinate-based MLPs that are both computationally intensive and slow to train. Although grid-based alternatives for implicit representations (e.g., Instant-NGP and K-Planes) train faster by exploiting signal structure, their reliance on linear interpolation restricts their ability to compute higher-order derivatives, rendering them unsuitable for solving DEs. Our approach overcomes these limitations by combining the efficiency of feature grids with radial basis function interpolation, which is infinitely differentiable. To effectively capture high-frequency solutions and enable stable and faster computation of global gradients, we introduce a multi-resolution decomposition with co-located grids. Our proposed representation, DInf-Grid, is trained implicitly using the differential equations as loss functions, enabling accurate modelling of physical fields. We validate DInf-Grid on a variety of tasks, including the Poisson equation for image reconstruction, the Helmholtz equation for wave fields, and the Kirchhoff-Love boundary value problem for cloth simulation. Our results demonstrate a 5-20x speed-up over coordinate-based MLP-based methods, solving differential equations in seconds or minutes while maintaining comparable accuracy and compactness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and develop a computing architecture that supports the vision of Society 5.0 smart cities, where humans and robots coexist and interact efficiently.

Method: A hybrid computing system composed of neuromorphic hardware (Loihi2 processor, event-based cameras) for perception and GPUs for high-level AI tasks was implemented and tested in a humanoid robot playing music collaboratively with a human.

Result: The proposed hybrid architecture integrates neuromorphic and AI systems, demonstrating enhanced performance and responsiveness in an interactive robotic task.

Conclusion: The heterogeneous computing architecture is promising for enabling advanced robotic autonomy and interactive intelligence, crucial for the realization of Society 5.0 initiatives like NEOM.

Abstract: After Industry 4.0 has embraced tight integration between machinery (OT), software (IT), and the Internet, creating a web of sensors, data, and algorithms in service of efficient and reliable production, a new concept of Society 5.0 is emerging, in which infrastructure of a city will be instrumented to increase reliability, efficiency, and safety. Robotics will play a pivotal role in enabling this vision that is pioneered by the NEOM initiative - a smart city, co-inhabited by humans and robots. In this paper we explore the computing platform that will be required to enable this vision. We show how we can combine neuromorphic computing hardware, exemplified by the Loihi2 processor used in conjunction with event-based cameras, for sensing and real-time perception and interaction with a local AI compute cluster (GPUs) for high-level language processing, cognition, and task planning. We demonstrate the use of this hybrid computing architecture in an interactive task, in which a humanoid robot plays a musical instrument with a human. Central to our design is the efficient and seamless integration of disparate components, ensuring that the synergy between software and hardware maximizes overall performance and responsiveness. Our proposed system architecture underscores the potential of heterogeneous computing architectures in advancing robotic autonomy and interactive intelligence, pointing toward a future where such integrated systems become the norm in complex, real-time applications.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a performance model for Intel's Loihi 2 neuromorphic chip that predicts runtime, focusing on compute and communication efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of expressive performance models limits researchers and developers in designing efficient algorithms for neuromorphic hardware, highlighting the need to address communication modeling in heavily-loaded Network-on-Chip systems.

Method: A max-affine lower-bound runtime model was developed using microbenchmarks tailored to Intel's Loihi 2 chip, focusing on compute and communication prediction.

Result: The proposed model achieved a tight correlation (Pearson ≥ 0.97) between predicted and actual runtimes for various test cases, and revealed tradeoff insights through scalability analysis of neural network layers.

Conclusion: This runtime model aids in designing faster and higher-performing algorithms for Loihi 2, delivering valuable insights on scalability and performance bottlenecks.

Abstract: Neuromorphic computers hold the potential to vastly improve the speed and efficiency of a wide range of computational kernels with their asynchronous, compute-memory co-located, spatially distributed, and scalable nature. However, performance models that are simple yet sufficiently expressive to predict runtime on actual neuromorphic hardware are lacking, posing a challenge for researchers and developers who strive to design fast algorithms and kernels. As breaking the memory bandwidth wall of conventional von-Neumann architectures is a primary neuromorphic advantage, modeling communication time is especially important. At the same time, modeling communication time is difficult, as complex congestion patterns arise in a heavily-loaded Network-on-Chip. In this work, we introduce the first max-affine lower-bound runtime model -- a multi-dimensional roofline model -- for Intel's Loihi 2 neuromorphic chip that quantitatively accounts for both compute and communication based on a suite of microbenchmarks. Despite being a lower-bound model, we observe a tight correspondence (Pearson correlation coefficient greater than or equal to 0.97) between our model's estimated runtime and the measured runtime on Loihi 2 for a neural network linear layer, i.e., matrix-vector multiplication, and for an example application, a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization solver. Furthermore, we derive analytical expressions for communication-bottlenecked runtime to study scalability of the linear layer, revealing an area-runtime tradeoff for different spatial workload configurations with linear to superliner runtime scaling in layer size with a variety of constant factors. Our max-affine runtime model helps empower the design of high-speed algorithms and kernels for Loihi 2.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of deep learning methods requiring large datasets, this work aims to create an efficient and interpretable molecular optimization method.

Method: MCEMOL employs dual-layer evolution integrating rule-based molecular transformations with crossover and mutation, supported by message-passing neural networks and chemical constraints.

Result: The framework achieves 100% molecular validity with diverse, target-compliant molecules showing strong symmetry, pharmacophore, and stereochemical optimization.

Conclusion: MCEMOL effectively bridges computational drug design and practical applications by providing interpretable, high-quality molecular outputs and reliable design rules.

Abstract: This study proposes MCEMOL (Multi-Constrained Evolutionary Molecular Design Framework), a molecular optimization approach integrating rule-based evolution with molecular crossover. MCEMOL employs dual-layer evolution: optimizing transformation rules at rule level while applying crossover and mutation to molecular structures. Unlike deep learning methods requiring large datasets and extensive training, our algorithm evolves efficiently from minimal starting molecules with low computational overhead. The framework incorporates message-passing neural networks and comprehensive chemical constraints, ensuring efficient and interpretable molecular design. Experimental results demonstrate that MCEMOL provides transparent design pathways through its evolutionary mechanism while generating valid, diverse, target-compliant molecules. The framework achieves 100% molecular validity with high structural diversity and excellent drug-likeness compliance, showing strong performance in symmetry constraints, pharmacophore optimization, and stereochemical integrity. Unlike black-box methods, MCEMOL delivers dual value: interpretable transformation rules researchers can understand and trust, alongside high-quality molecular libraries for practical applications. This establishes a paradigm where interpretable AI-driven drug design and effective molecular generation are achieved simultaneously, bridging the gap between computational innovation and practical drug discovery needs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve long-term search performance in real parameter single-objective optimization by addressing population stagnation experienced in existing evolutionary algorithms like EA4eig.

Method: An enhanced evolutionary algorithm, EA4eigCS, was created by integrating two new secondary algorithms, crisscross search and sparrow search, into EA4eig for processing inferior individuals, aimed at diversifying the population distribution and breaking stagnation.

Result: Experimental findings reveal that EA4eigCS outperforms the original EA4eig and exhibits competitive capabilities when compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.

Conclusion: EA4eigCS is presented as an effective solution for advancing evolutionary algorithms in long-term optimization tasks, combining new strategies to enhance search diversity and performance.

Abstract: In the field of artificial intelligence, real parameter single objective optimization is an important direction. Both the Differential Evolution (DE) and the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) demonstrate good performance for real parameter single objective optimization. Nevertheless, there exist other types of evolutionary algorithm for the purpose. In recent years, researchers begin to study long-term search. EA4eig - an ensemble of three DE variants and CMA-ES - performs well for long-term search. In this paper, we introduce two types of evolutionary algorithm proposed recently - crisscross search and sparrow search - into EA4eig as secondary evolutionary algorithms to process inferior individuals. Thus, EA4eigCS is obtained. In our ensemble, the secondary evolutionary algorithms are expected to vary distribution of the population for breaking stagnation. Experimental results show that our EA4eigCS outperforms EA4eig and is competitive when compared with state-of-the-art algorithms.

TL;DR: This paper analyzes challenges in using Large Language Models (LLMs) for evolutionary searches, pinpointing failure modes, and proposes the PACEvolve framework to overcome them, demonstrating its superior performance across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies and systematic failures in LLM-based evolutionary search processes caused by issues like context pollution, mode collapse, and weak collaboration.

Method: The paper introduces PACEvolve, which includes hierarchical context management (HCM) and pruning to manage experimental context, momentum-based backtracking (MBB) to escape local minima, and a self-adaptive sampling policy to unify exploration and collaboration in searches.

Result: PACEvolve achieves state-of-the-art results on LLM-SR and KernelBench benchmarks, and discovers superior solutions in Modded NanoGPT, showcasing its strength in self-improvement and search dynamics.

Conclusion: The PACEvolve framework effectively addresses major bottlenecks in evolutionary search with LLMs, improving process robustness and delivering exceptional results for extended problem-solving horizons.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful operators for evolutionary search, yet the design of efficient search scaffolds remains ad hoc. While promising, current LLM-in-the-loop systems lack a systematic approach to managing the evolutionary process. We identify three distinct failure modes: Context Pollution, where experiment history biases future candidate generation; Mode Collapse, where agents stagnate in local minima due to poor exploration-exploitation balance; and Weak Collaboration, where rigid crossover strategies fail to leverage parallel search trajectories effectively. We introduce Progress-Aware Consistent Evolution (PACEvolve), a framework designed to robustly govern the agent's context and search dynamics, to address these challenges. PACEvolve combines hierarchical context management (HCM) with pruning to address context pollution; momentum-based backtracking (MBB) to escape local minima; and a self-adaptive sampling policy that unifies backtracking and crossover for dynamic search coordination (CE), allowing agents to balance internal refinement with cross-trajectory collaboration. We demonstrate that PACEvolve provides a systematic path to consistent, long-horizon self-improvement, achieving state-of-the-art results on LLM-SR and KernelBench, while discovering solutions surpassing the record on Modded NanoGPT.

Main category: cs.PF

TL;DR: The study addresses emergency department overcrowding by proposing a threshold-based policy for redirecting non-urgent patients. A mathematical queuing model determines optimal thresholds for patient redirection, showing context-dependent performance gains in rural and urban EDs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses systemic challenges of overcrowding and patient boarding in emergency departments, aiming to improve care quality and operational efficiency by managing patient inflow during peak hours.

Method: A two-class $M/M/c$ preemptive-priority queuing model is used, where high-acuity patients have priority and low-acuity patients may be redirected based on congestion levels. A level-dependent Quasi-Birth-Death (QBD) process is applied to optimize a time-averaged objective function.

Result: Numerical analysis demonstrates that the proposed redirection policy results in significant improvements in performance, with up to 4.84% gain for rural EDs and 5.90% for urban EDs based on national healthcare data.

Conclusion: The research provides an effective, mathematically-based framework for balancing clinical priority and operational efficiency, with context-adaptable policies that improve emergency department performance across diverse environments.

Abstract: Emergency department (ED) overcrowding and patient boarding represent critical systemic challenges that compromise care quality. We propose a threshold-based admission policy that redirects non-urgent patients to alternative care pathways, such as telemedicine, during peak congestion. The ED is modeled as a two-class $M/M/c$ preemptive-priority queuing system, where high-acuity patients are prioritized and low-acuity patients are subject to state-dependent redirection. Analyzed via a level-dependent Quasi-Birth-Death (QBD) process, the model determines the optimal threshold by maximizing a long-run time-averaged objective function comprising redirection-affected revenue and costs associated with patient balking and system occupancy. Numerical analysis using national healthcare data reveals that optimal policies are highly context-dependent. While rural EDs generally optimize at lower redirection thresholds, urban EDs exhibit performance peaks at moderate thresholds. Results indicate that our optimal policy yields significant performance gains of up to $4.84\%$ in rural settings and $5.90\%$ in urban environments. This research provides a mathematically rigorous framework for balancing clinical priority with operational efficiency across diverse ED settings.

Method: VarMRI uses selective event recording to address big data issues, recording only impactful events and employing a coarse-to-fine-grained recording strategy. It also introduces an efficient, robust, and user-informative data analysis method.

Result: The tool was used for a 3,000-hour study of six applications on CloudLab, revealing diverse causes of latency variance, such as interrupt preemption and NUMA balancing, and enabled latency reductions of up to 31%.

Conclusion: VarMRI demonstrates the importance of long-term monitoring to reveal latency-related events and optimize application performance.

Abstract: This paper presents our experience to understand latency variance caused by kernel and hardware events, which are often invisible at the application level. For this purpose, we have built VarMRI, a tool chain to monitor and analyze those events in the long term. To mitigate the "big data" problem caused by long-term monitoring, VarMRI selectively records a subset of events following two principles: it only records events that are affecting the requests recorded by the application; it records coarse-grained information first and records additional information only when necessary. Furthermore, VarMRI introduces an analysis method that is efficient on large amount of data, robust on different data set and against missing data, and informative to the user.
  VarMRI has helped us to carry out a 3,000-hour study of six applications and benchmarks on CloudLab. It reveals a wide variety of events causing latency variance, including interrupt preemption, Java GC, pipeline stall, NUMA balancing etc.; simple optimization or tuning can reduce tail latencies by up to 31%. Furthermore, the impacts of some of these events vary significantly across different experiments, which confirms the necessity of long-term monitoring.

Motivation: To explore how variable scoping in programming impacts code efficiency and provide insights for better management in SAS and R.

Method: Analyzing and comparing the scoping rules—dynamic scoping in SAS leveraging symbol tables and lexical scoping in R using environments. Illustrative examples are used.

Result: Differences in scoping strategies and their influence on code behavior are demonstrated, with practical tools for debugging/optimization provided.

Conclusion: Understanding SAS's dynamic scoping and R's lexical scoping empowers programmers to optimize their variable management across these languages.

Abstract: Variable scoping dictates how and where variables are accessible within programming languages, playing a crucial role in code efficiency and organization. This paper examines the distinct scoping rules in SAS and R, focusing on SAS's dynamic scoping and R's lexical scoping. In SAS, dynamic scoping utilizes symbol tables, resolving variables at runtime by dynamically searching through active macro layers. R, in contrast, employs lexical scoping, using environments to resolve variables based on the structure in which functions are defined. Illustrative examples highlight the differences between these scoping strategies, showcasing their impact on code behavior. Additionally, the paper outlines methods for inspecting variables in SAS's symbol tables and R's environments, offering practical insights for debugging and optimization. Strategies for controlling variable scope in both languages are discussed, enhancing code precision and reliability. This exploration equips programmers with critical understanding to optimize variable management, improving their programming practices in SAS and R.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigates the differences in lazy evaluation mechanisms in SAS and R to understand their effects on programming efficiency.

Method: Analyzes SAS MACROs and R functions, comparing their lazy evaluation techniques with illustrative examples.

Result: Highlights differences in lazy evaluation strategies, such as call-by-name in SAS using symbol tables and call-by-need in R using Promise data structure.

Conclusion: Provides insights to optimize programming efficiency and guides programmers in leveraging lazy evaluation in SAS and R.

Abstract: Lazy evaluation is a powerful technique that can optimize code execution by deferring evaluations until their results are required, thus enhancing efficiency. In most modern programming languages, like R, lazy evaluation is commonly applied to function arguments. However, the application of lazy evaluation in SAS has not been extensively explored. This paper focuses on the mechanisms of lazy evaluation in SAS MACROs and R functions, offering a comparative analysis of the underlying principles that drive these processes.
  R's lazy evaluation is driven by a data structure called Promise, which postpones evaluation and does not occupy memory until the value is needed, utilizing a call-by-need strategy. SAS, on the other hand, achieves lazy evaluation through its symbol tables, employing memory to store parameters, and operates on a call-by-name basis. These discrepancies in lazy evaluation strategies can notably impact the results of R functions and SAS MACROs. By examining these distinct approaches, the paper illuminates the impact of lazy evaluation on programming efficiency, supported by illustrative examples. As the shift from SAS to R becomes increasingly prevalent in the pharmaceutical industry, understanding these techniques enables programmers to optimize their code for greater efficacy. This exploration serves as a guide to enhance programming capabilities and performance in both languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of interpretability and rigorous safety guarantees in AI-powered autonomous vehicles, especially in dynamic, human-involved traffic environments.

Method: The proposed method integrates Barrier Certificates with traffic conflict metrics (TTC), uses SMT solvers for safety verification, and deploys adaptive controls for real-time adherence to safety constraints.

Result: Real-world highway data testing shows up to 40% reduction in unsafe interactions and complete elimination of safety conflicts in some lanes using this framework.

Conclusion: The approach achieves interpretable, provable safety guarantees and demonstrates practical scalability for safer autonomous driving.

Abstract: Modern AI technologies enable autonomous vehicles to perceive complex scenes, predict human behavior, and make real-time driving decisions. However, these data-driven components often operate as black boxes, lacking interpretability and rigorous safety guarantees. Autonomous vehicles operate in dynamic, mixed-traffic environments where interactions with human-driven vehicles introduce uncertainty and safety challenges. This work develops a formally verified safety framework for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) that integrates Barrier Certificates (BCs) with interpretable traffic conflict metrics, specifically Time-to-Collision (TTC) as a spatio-temporal safety metric. Safety conditions are verified using Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers, and an adaptive control mechanism ensures vehicles comply with these constraints in real time. Evaluation on real-world highway datasets shows a significant reduction in unsafe interactions, with up to 40\% fewer events where TTC falls below a 3 seconds threshold, and complete elimination of conflicts in some lanes. This approach provides both interpretable and provable safety guarantees, demonstrating a practical and scalable strategy for safe autonomous driving.

Multidisciplinary clinical teams and end users were involved throughout the co-development process, which focused on early integration into real-world paediatric surgical and psychiatric settings. The robot, based on the NAO platform, features a simple setup, adaptable exercise routines with interactive guidance, motivational dialogue, and a graphical user interface (GUI) for monitoring and no-code system feedback.
  Results: Deployment in hospital environments enabled the identification of key design requirements and usability constraints. Stakeholder feedback led to refinements in interaction design, movement capabilities, and technical configuration. A feasibility study is currently underway to assess acceptance, usability, and perceived therapeutic benefit, with data collection including questionnaires, behavioural observations, and staff-patient interviews.
  Discussion: Mobirobot demonstrates how multiprofessional, stakeholder-led development can yield a socially assistive system suited for dynamic inpatient settings. Early-stage findings underscore the importance of contextual integration, robustness, and minimal-intrusion design. While challenges such as sensor limitations and patient recruitment remain, the platform offers a promising foundation for further research and clinical application.

### [288] [How Human Motion Prediction Quality Shapes Social Robot Navigation Performance in Constrained Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09856)
*Andrew Stratton,Phani Teja Singamaneni,Pranav Goyal,Rachid Alami,Christoforos Mavrogiannis*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper examines how human motion prediction quality impacts robot navigation in dynamic, limited spaces and its effects on both human and robotic performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the integration of robots in human-centric environments like warehouses or hospitals by improving robot navigation and their response to human behavior.

Method: A user study ($N=80$) involving two different robot platforms across two global sites in constrained workspaces. It evaluated human motion prediction models and their influence on navigation outcomes.

Result: Findings reveal that: 1) Average displacement error is a poor metric of quality, 2) Human cooperation assumptions may fail in tight spaces, and 3) Robot efficiency often negatively affects human comfort and productivity.

Conclusion: Designing robots for dynamic, spatially constrained environments requires nuanced models of human behavior, beyond standard metrics and assumptions, to ensure safety, comfort, and mutual efficiency.

Abstract: Motivated by the vision of integrating mobile robots closer to humans in warehouses, hospitals, manufacturing plants, and the home, we focus on robot navigation in dynamic and spatially constrained environments. Ensuring human safety, comfort, and efficiency in such settings requires that robots are endowed with a model of how humans move around them. Human motion prediction around robots is especially challenging due to the stochasticity of human behavior, differences in user preferences, and data scarcity. In this work, we perform a methodical investigation of the effects of human motion prediction quality on robot navigation performance, as well as human productivity and impressions. We design a scenario involving robot navigation among two human subjects in a constrained workspace and instantiate it in a user study ($N=80$) involving two different robot platforms, conducted across two sites from different world regions. Key findings include evidence that: 1) the widely adopted average displacement error is not a reliable predictor of robot navigation performance and human impressions; 2) the common assumption of human cooperation breaks down in constrained environments, with users often not reciprocating robot cooperation, and causing performance degradations; 3) more efficient robot navigation often comes at the expense of human efficiency and comfort.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of achieving accurate and safe robotic grasping in environments with dynamic and visually occluded conditions.

Method: SyncTwin unifies 3D scene reconstruction and real-to-sim synchronization. It uses VGGT to create a 3D geometry library from images and updates digital twin states via point cloud segmentation and colored-ICP registration.

Result: Experiments confirm that SyncTwin improves grasp accuracy and safety in dynamic and occluded scenes.

Conclusion: SyncTwin demonstrates the viability of digital-twin synchronization for achieving robust and safe robotic manipulation in complex environments.

Abstract: Accurate and safe grasping under dynamic and visually occluded conditions remains a core challenge in real-world robotic manipulation. We present SyncTwin, a digital twin framework that unifies fast 3D scene reconstruction and real-to-sim synchronization for robust and safety-aware grasping in such environments. In the offline stage, we employ VGGT to rapidly reconstruct object-level 3D assets from RGB images, forming a reusable geometry library for simulation. During execution, SyncTwin continuously synchronizes the digital twin by tracking real-world object states via point cloud segmentation updates and aligning them through colored-ICP registration. The updated twin enables motion planners to compute collision-free and dynamically feasible trajectories in simulation, which are safely executed on the real robot through a closed real-to-sim-to-real loop. Experiments in dynamic and occluded scenes show that SyncTwin improves grasp accuracy and motion safety, demonstrating the effectiveness of digital-twin synchronization for real-world robotic execution.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents UMI-FT, a handheld platform with finger-mounted force sensors for multimodal data collection to train adaptive compliance policies for force-sensitive robotic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current force/torque sensors are expensive, bulky, and fragile, limiting large-scale learning for force-aware robotic manipulation.

Method: Developed UMI-FT, equipped with six-axis force/torque sensors on fingertips, RGB, depth, and pose data collection, enabling multimodal manipulation data for policy training.

Result: Using UMI-FT, policies successfully regulate forces in tasks like whiteboard wiping, zucchini skewering, and lightbulb insertion, outperforming baselines lacking compliance or sensing.

Conclusion: The open-source UMI-FT provides a scalable way to learn compliant robotic manipulation in real-world settings, promising broader adoption and progress in this domain.

Abstract: Many manipulation tasks require careful force modulation. With insufficient force the task may fail, while excessive force could cause damage. The high cost, bulky size and fragility of commercial force/torque (F/T) sensors have limited large-scale, force-aware policy learning. We introduce UMI-FT, a handheld data-collection platform that mounts compact, six-axis force/torque sensors on each finger, enabling finger-level wrench measurements alongside RGB, depth, and pose. Using the multimodal data collected from this device, we train an adaptive compliance policy that predicts position targets, grasp force, and stiffness for execution on standard compliance controllers. In evaluations on three contact-rich, force-sensitive tasks (whiteboard wiping, skewering zucchini, and lightbulb insertion), UMI-FT enables policies that reliably regulate external contact forces and internal grasp forces, outperforming baselines that lack compliance or force sensing. UMI-FT offers a scalable path to learning compliant manipulation from in-the-wild demonstrations. We open-source the hardware and software to facilitate broader adoption at:https://umi-ft.github.io/.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CoCoPlan improves multi-robot coordination under limited communication by optimizing task planning and intermittent communication, demonstrating significant improvements in efficiency, scalability, and communication reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome limitations in multi-robot coordination methods that fail to adapt to dynamic task distributions under constrained communication environments.

Method: CoCoPlan integrates a branch-and-bound architecture, adaptive objective function, and optimization module to coordinate task assignments and intermittent communication in dynamic scenarios.

Result: The framework achieves 22.4% higher task completion, reduces communication overhead by 58.6%, and supports robust scalability with up to 100 robots, validated in office and disaster-response scenarios.

Conclusion: CoCoPlan effectively addresses challenges in multi-robot coordination under limited communication, significantly improving task efficiency, scalability, and communication management.

Abstract: Multi-robot systems can greatly enhance efficiency through coordination and collaboration, yet in practice, full-time communication is rarely available and interactions are constrained to close-range exchanges. Existing methods either maintain all-time connectivity, rely on fixed schedules, or adopt pairwise protocols, but none adapt effectively to dynamic spatio-temporal task distributions under limited communication, resulting in suboptimal coordination. To address this gap, we propose CoCoPlan, a unified framework that co-optimizes collaborative task planning and team-wise intermittent communication. Our approach integrates a branch-and-bound architecture that jointly encodes task assignments and communication events, an adaptive objective function that balances task efficiency against communication latency, and a communication event optimization module that strategically determines when, where and how the global connectivity should be re-established. Extensive experiments demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods by achieving a 22.4% higher task completion rate, reducing communication overhead by 58.6%, and improving the scalability by supporting up to 100 robots in dynamic environments. Hardware experiments include the complex 2D office environment and large-scale 3D disaster-response scenario.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for mobile 3D printing on unstructured terrain that integrates AI-driven disturbance prediction with sensor fusion and hierarchical control to achieve precise printing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current gantry-based printing systems lack mobility, while mobile platforms cannot handle uneven terrain effectively, creating a need for a system that combines mobility with high print precision.

Method: The framework involves AI learning from sensor data (IMU, vision, depth) to predict terrain-induced disturbances. This is used within a three-layer control system that includes path planning, predictive coordination, and precision hardware operations.

Result: Outdoor tests demonstrated sub-centimeter printing accuracy on uneven terrain with slopes, achieving both mobility and precision.

Conclusion: This approach provides a foundational system for autonomous construction in challenging, unstructured environments, enhancing the feasibility of mobile 3D printing.

Abstract: Mobile 3D printing on unstructured terrain remains challenging due to the conflict between platform mobility and deposition precision. Existing gantry-based systems achieve high accuracy but lack mobility, while mobile platforms struggle to maintain print quality on uneven ground. We present a framework that tightly integrates AI-driven disturbance prediction with multi-modal sensor fusion and hierarchical hardware control, forming a closed-loop perception-learning-actuation system. The AI module learns terrain-to-perturbation mappings from IMU, vision, and depth sensors, enabling proactive compensation rather than reactive correction. This intelligence is embedded into a three-layer control architecture: path planning, predictive chassis-manipulator coordination, and precision hardware execution. Through outdoor experiments on terrain with slopes and surface irregularities, we demonstrate sub-centimeter printing accuracy while maintaining full platform mobility. This AI-hardware integration establishes a practical foundation for autonomous construction in unstructured environments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes an automated method for analyzing kinematics in origami-inspired structures using a Pfaffian constraint matrix, simplifying constraint calculation for complex rigid foldable structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the lack of a unified method for analyzing kinematic constraints in various rigid foldable structures, which often rely on tedious and error-prone manual calculations.

Method: The paper introduces a tool that uses a minimally extended data schema to construct facet-hinge graphs, determine minimum cycle bases, and generate velocity-level constraint matrices for robust kinematic analysis via screw theory.

Result: The results include an efficient and automated computation of deployable and foldable motions for diverse origami-inspired rigid foldable structures, supported by visualization capabilities.

Conclusion: The approach simplifies and enhances the study of kinematics in rigid foldable structures, providing an accurate and unified framework for analyzing constraints.

Abstract: Origami-inspired structures with rigid panels now span thick, kirigami, and multi-sheet realizations, making unified kinematic analysis essential. Yet a general method that consolidates their loop constraints has been lacking. We present an automated approach that generates the Pfaffian constraint matrix for arbitrary rigid foldable structures (RFS). From a minimally extended data schema, the tool constructs the facet-hinge graph, extracts a minimum cycle basis that captures all constraints, and assembles a velocity-level constraint matrix via screw theory that encodes coupled rotation and translation loop closure. The framework computes and visualizes deploy and fold motions across diverse RFS while eliminating tedious and error-prone constraint calculations.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for safe and efficient mobile robot navigation using Gaussian processes to learn barrier functions online from motion predictions, achieving superior performance in dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safe navigation in complex, dynamic environments with moving obstacles is challenging, particularly when traditional controllers like CBFs rely only on obstacles' current states, increasing collision risks.

Method: The method combines Gaussian processes for online learning of barrier functions and modulated control barrier functions (MCBFs) with neural network motion predictions and automatic parameter tuning for adaptable obstacle avoidance.

Result: Experiments in simulations and real-world scenarios show the framework outperforms baseline methods in safety and efficiency in crowded environments.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables mobile robots to navigate safely and efficiently by predicting and learning barrier functions, proving its effectiveness in both simulations and real-world demonstrations.

Abstract: This work addresses the challenge of safe and efficient mobile robot navigation in complex dynamic environments with concave moving obstacles. Reactive safe controllers like Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) design obstacle avoidance strategies based only on the current states of the obstacles, risking future collisions. To alleviate this problem, we use Gaussian processes to learn barrier functions online from multimodal motion predictions of obstacles generated by neural networks trained with energy-based learning. The learned barrier functions are then fed into quadratic programs using modulated CBFs (MCBFs), a local-minimum-free version of CBFs, to achieve safe and efficient navigation. The proposed framework makes two key contributions. First, it develops a prediction-to-barrier function online learning pipeline. Second, it introduces an autonomous parameter tuning algorithm that adapts MCBFs to deforming, prediction-based barrier functions. The framework is evaluated in both simulations and real-world experiments, consistently outperforming baselines and demonstrating superior safety and efficiency in crowded dynamic environments.

*Eszter Birtalan,Miklós Koller*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study evaluates six different tactile sensor configurations on robotic hands to determine their impact on reinforcement learning, identifying an optimal layout for improving robotic hand design and prosthetics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of consensus on tactile sensor density and layout on robotic hands, which hampers grasp stability and capabilities like texture identification in applications such as prosthetics.

Method: The authors used simulations to test six tactile sensor configurations, varying in density and layout, and evaluated their impact on reinforcement learning performance. The study employed a two-setup system to ensure robust and generalized results.

Result: One specific sensor configuration consistently showed the best performance across different setups, providing insight into optimal sensor layouts for robotic hands.

Conclusion: This research informs future designs of robotic hands and prosthetic devices by identifying an optimal tactile sensor configuration for enhanced functionality.

Abstract: Tactile sensors are breaking into the field of robotics to provide direct information related to contact surfaces, including contact events, slip events and even texture identification. These events are especially important for robotic hand designs, including prosthetics, as they can greatly improve grasp stability. Most presently published robotic hand designs, however, implement them in vastly different densities and layouts on the hand surface, often reserving the majority of the available space. We used simulations to evaluate 6 different tactile sensor configurations with different densities and layouts, based on their impact on reinforcement learning. Our two-setup system allows for robust results that are not dependent on the use of a given physics simulator, robotic hand model or machine learning algorithm. Our results show setup-specific, as well as generalized effects across the 6 sensorized simulations, and we identify one configuration as consistently yielding the best performance across both setups. These results could help future research aimed at robotic hand designs, including prostheses.

*David Morilla-Cabello,Eduardo Montijano*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes CHORAL, a framework for coordinating heterogeneous robots in complex environments using semantic-aware mapping and routing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large, complex environments present challenges for autonomous robots, but heterogenous teams with complementary strengths can improve outcomes. However, current methods lack integration of detailed semantic scene understanding in routing decisions.

Method: The authors developed CHORAL, integrating open-vocabulary vision models for semantic map creation, region identification, and capability-aware path planning, followed by a heterogeneous vehicle routing approach.

Result: Simulations and real-world experiments demonstrated that CHORAL effectively plans safer and more efficient routes, leveraging each robot platform’s strengths.

Conclusion: CHORAL enhances heterogeneous robot team coordination and routing through semantic-awareness, with practical applications proven and open-source availability for broader use.

Abstract: Monitoring large, unknown, and complex environments with autonomous robots poses significant navigation challenges, where deploying teams of heterogeneous robots with complementary capabilities can substantially improve both mission performance and feasibility. However, effectively modeling how different robotic platforms interact with the environment requires rich, semantic scene understanding. Despite this, existing approaches often assume homogeneous robot teams or focus on discrete task compatibility rather than continuous routing. Consequently, scene understanding is not fully integrated into routing decisions, limiting their ability to adapt to the environment and to leverage each robot's strengths. In this paper, we propose an integrated semantic-aware framework for coordinating heterogeneous robots. Starting from a reconnaissance flight, we build a metric-semantic map using open-vocabulary vision models and use it to identify regions requiring closer inspection and capability-aware paths for each platform to reach them. These are then incorporated into a heterogeneous vehicle routing formulation that jointly assigns inspection tasks and computes robot trajectories. Experiments in simulation and in a real inspection mission with three robotic platforms demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in planning safer and more efficient routes by explicitly accounting for each platform's navigation capabilities. We release our framework, CHORAL, as open source to support reproducibility and deployment of diverse robot teams.

*Yan Liu,Tao Yu,Haolin Song,Hongbo Zhu,Nianzong Hu,Yuzhi Hao,Xiuyong Yao,Xizhe Zang,Hua Chen,Jie Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces FastStair, a learning framework combining model-based and model-free reinforcement learning (RL) approaches to enable humanoid robots to ascend stairs quickly and safely.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humanoid robots struggle with stair ascent due to the simultaneous need for agility and stability. The paper addresses challenges like unsafe behavior in RL and overly conservative model-based planning.

Method: FastStair integrates a foothold planner into RL to guide exploration, pretrain a base safety policy, and fine-tune specialized policies for high-speed maneuvers. Finally, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is used to blend policies for smooth speed performance.

Result: The framework was deployed on the Oli humanoid achieving stable stair movement at speeds up to 1.65 m/s, completing a 33-step spiral staircase in 12 seconds, and winning a robot competition.

Conclusion: FastStair effectively balances stability and agility in stair ascent, enabling high-speed and robust performance across various stair structures.

Abstract: Running up stairs is effortless for humans but remains extremely challenging for humanoid robots due to the simultaneous requirements of high agility and strict stability. Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) can generate dynamic locomotion, yet implicit stability rewards and heavy reliance on task-specific reward shaping tend to result in unsafe behaviors, especially on stairs; conversely, model-based foothold planners encode contact feasibility and stability structure, but enforcing their hard constraints often induces conservative motion that limits speed. We present FastStair, a planner-guided, multi-stage learning framework that reconciles these complementary strengths to achieve fast and stable stair ascent. FastStair integrates a parallel model-based foothold planner into the RL training loop to bias exploration toward dynamically feasible contacts and to pretrain a safety-focused base policy. To mitigate planner-induced conservatism and the discrepancy between low- and high-speed action distributions, the base policy was fine-tuned into speed-specialized experts and then integrated via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to enable smooth operation across the full commanded-speed range. We deploy the resulting controller on the Oli humanoid robot, achieving stable stair ascent at commanded speeds up to 1.65 m/s and traversing a 33-step spiral staircase (17 cm rise per step) in 12 s, demonstrating robust high-speed performance on long staircases. Notably, the proposed approach served as the champion solution in the Canton Tower Robot Run Up Competition.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Bayesian Regression-based Symbolic Learning (BRSL) framework for real-time symbolic discovery in digital twins, addressing the need for high accuracy, interpretability, and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current digital twin models struggle to simultaneously achieve high predictive accuracy, interpretability, and online adaptability. Existing methods, like Bayesian models and symbolic methods, fail to balance these aspects effectively.

Method: The proposed BRSL framework integrates symbolic discovery into a probabilistic state-space model using sparse horseshoe priors and an online recursive algorithm with a forgetting factor. It enables system identification, uncertainty quantification, and real-time adaptability.

Result: The framework demonstrates superior probabilistic prediction, robust online learning, and interpretable models, supported by extensive convergence analysis and real-time adaptation monitoring.

Conclusion: The BRSL framework effectively addresses the gaps in accuracy, interpretability, and adaptability for digital twins, providing a robust solution for real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance.

Abstract: Digital twins (DTs), serving as the core enablers for real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance of complex cyber-physical systems, impose critical requirements on their virtual models: high predictive accuracy, strong interpretability, and online adaptive capability. However, existing techniques struggle to meet these demands simultaneously: Bayesian methods excel in uncertainty quantification but lack model interpretability, while interpretable symbolic identification methods (e.g., SINDy) are constrained by their offline, batch-processing nature, which make real-time updates challenging. To bridge this semantic and computational gap, this paper proposes a novel Bayesian Regression-based Symbolic Learning (BRSL) framework. The framework formulates online symbolic discovery as a unified probabilistic state-space model. By incorporating sparse horseshoe priors, model selection is transformed into a Bayesian inference task, enabling simultaneous system identification and uncertainty quantification. Furthermore, we derive an online recursive algorithm with a forgetting factor and establish precise recursive conditions that guarantee the well-posedness of the posterior distribution. These conditions also function as real-time monitors for data utility, enhancing algorithmic robustness. Additionally, a rigorous convergence analysis is provided, demonstrating the convergence of parameter estimates under persistent excitation conditions. Case studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in achieving interpretable, probabilistic prediction and online learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve systemic issues in governing IoT data in global manufacturing despite advanced data storage and ingestion solutions, especially given the distributed and dynamic nature of operational environments.

Method: The paper introduces a federated governance model based on contract-driven interoperability, policy-as-code enforcement, and asset-centric accountability, tailored to manufacturing IoT environments.

Result: The proposed model ensures semantic consistency, quality control, and regulatory compliance while avoiding centralized governance, by addressing key architectural boundaries.

Conclusion: The federated model aligns with real-world manufacturing constraints and governance demands, offering a novel system architecture framework, with future work needed for empirical validations.

Abstract: Industrial IoT platforms in global manufacturing environments generate continuous operational data across production assets, utilities, and connected products. While data ingestion and storage capabilities have matured significantly, enterprises continue to face systemic challenges in governing IoT data at scale. These challenges are not rooted in tooling limitations but in the absence of a governance model that aligns with the realities of distributed operational ownership, heterogeneous source systems, and continuous change at the edge. This paper presents a federated governance model that emphasizes contract-driven interoperability, policy-as-code enforcement, and asset-centric accountability across global manufacturing organizations. The model addresses governance enforcement at architectural boundaries, enabling semantic consistency, quality assurance, and regulatory compliance without requiring centralized control of operational technology systems. This work contributes a systems architecture and design framework grounded in analysis of manufacturing IoT requirements and constraints; empirical validation remains future work

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the benefits of formal software specification, it faces limited adoption due to high notation overhead and required expertise in traditional languages.

Method: The approach uses natural language combined with lightweight mathematical notation, written in LaTeX, refined by AI, for intermediate specifications prior to code generation.

Result: The method was applied to a complex organizational knowledge growth simulation, yielding early validation, correctness by design, and significant reduction in development effort.

Conclusion: AI-enhanced formal specifications in natural language can reduce cost and expertise barriers while retaining the benefits of formal rigor and generating reliable implementations swiftly.

Abstract: Formal software specification is known to enable early error detection and explicit invariants, yet it has seen limited industrial adoption due to its high notation overhead and the expertise required to use traditional formal languages. This paper presents a case study showing that recent advances in artificial intelligence make it possible to retain many of the benefits of formal specification while substantially reducing these costs. The necessity of a clear distinction between what is controlled by the system analyst and can highly benefits from the rigor of formal specification and what need not be controlled is demonstrated. We use natural language augmented with lightweight mathematical notation and written in \LaTeX\ as an intermediate specification language, which is reviewed and refined by AI prior to code generation. Applied to a nontrivial simulation of organizational knowledge growth, this approach enables early validation, explicit invariants, and correctness by design, while significantly reducing development effort and producing a correct implementation on the first attempt.

*Suriya Sureshkumar*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces R-LAM, a framework that enhances Large Action Models (LAMs) for reproducible scientific workflows, addressing their shortcomings in auditability and deterministic execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Action Models (LAMs) lack critical features like reproducibility, determinism, and auditability required for scientific workflows.

Method: R-LAM incorporates structured action schemas, deterministic execution policies, explicit provenance tracking, and controlled experimentation.

Result: Experimental evaluations show that R-LAM improves reproducibility and reliable execution compared to generic LLM-based agents.

Conclusion: R-LAM offers a promising solution for reproducible and reliable scientific workflow automation by refining LAM capabilities.

Abstract: Large Action Models (LAMs) extend large language models by enabling autonomous decision-making and tool execution, making them promising for automating scientific workflows. However, scientific workflows impose strict requirements on reproducibility, auditability, and deterministic execution, which are not satisfied by generic LLM-based agents. Unconstrained action generation can lead to silent state changes, non-deterministic executions, and irreproducible experimental results, limiting the applicability of LAMs in scientific settings.
  In this paper, we propose R-LAM, a reproducibility-constrained framework for applying Large Action Models to scientific workflow automation. R-LAM introduces structured action schemas, deterministic execution policies, and explicit provenance tracking to ensure that every action and intermediate artifact is auditable and replayable. The framework supports failure-aware execution loops and controlled workflow forking, enabling iterative experimentation without compromising reproducibility.
  We implement R-LAM as a lightweight Python framework and release it as an open-source PyPI package to facilitate reproducible research. An experimental evaluation of representative scientific workflows demonstrates that R-LAM improves reproducibility success rates and execution reliability compared to unconstrained LLM-based agents, while retaining adaptive control over workflow execution.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAGE, a conversational AI based on the OPACA framework, designed for dynamic tool integration and zero-shot prompting in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the challenge of dynamically integrating and efficiently using domain-specific tools with large language models.

Method: Authors developed SAGE, a modular AI interface integrated with OPACA, enabling seamless switching between models, fine-tuned agent prompts, and robust tool execution strategies.

Result: Evaluated task-solving strategies highlighted strengths/weaknesses in different approaches, with promising performance. Open Source/Open Data materials were shared on GitHub.

Conclusion: SAGE and OPACA enhance tool integration and LLM capabilities by presenting scalable solutions for custom tool usage, demonstrating extensibility and robustness in real-world applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have proven to work well in question-answering scenarios, but real-world applications often require access to tools for live information or actuation. For this, LLMs can be extended with tools, which are often defined in advance, also allowing for some fine-tuning for specific use cases. However, rapidly evolving software landscapes and individual services require the constant development and integration of new tools. Domain- or company-specific tools can greatly elevate the usefulness of an LLM, but such custom tools can be problematic to integrate, or the LLM may fail to reliably understand and use them. For this, we need strategies to define new tools and integrate them into the LLM dynamically, as well as robust and scalable zero-shot prompting methods that can make use of those tools in an efficient manner. In this paper, we present SAGE, a specialized conversational AI interface, based on the OPACA framework for tool discovery and execution. The integration with OPACA makes it easy to add new tools or services for the LLM to use, while SAGE itself presents rich extensibility and modularity. This not only provides the ability to seamlessly switch between different models (e.g. GPT, LLAMA), but also to add and select prompting methods, involving various setups of differently prompted agents for selecting and executing tools and evaluating the results. We implemented a number of task-solving strategies, making use of agentic concepts and prompting methods in various degrees of complexity, and evaluated those against a comprehensive set of benchmark services. The results are promising and highlight the distinct strengths and weaknesses of different task-solving strategies. Both SAGE and the OPACA framework, as well as the different benchmark services and results, are available as Open Source/Open Data on GitHub.

### [304] [Investigating Tool-Memory Conflicts in Tool-Augmented LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09760)
*Jiali Cheng,Rui Pan,Hadi Amiri*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new conflict type for tool-augmented large language models called Tool-Memory Conflict (TMC) and finds that existing models struggle with it, especially in STEM applications. Existing resolutions are evaluated but found inadequate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify and address an overlooked issue — knowledge conflicts, specifically Tool-Memory Conflict (TMC), in tool-augmented LLMs, which hinder their performance in applications.

Method: The study identifies TMC by investigating interactions between parametric knowledge within LLMs and external tool knowledge. It evaluates existing conflict resolution approaches including prompting and RAG-based methods on the issue.

Result: The analysis reveals that TMC is prevalent in tool-augmented LLMs, particularly on STEM-related tasks. Tested conflict-resolving methods fail to address this challenge effectively.

Conclusion: Tool-Memory Conflict represents a critical limitation in current tool-augmented LLMs. None of the existing methods adequately resolve these inconsistencies, highlighting a need for improved strategies.

Abstract: Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) have powered many applications. However, they are likely to suffer from knowledge conflict. In this paper, we propose a new type of knowledge conflict -- Tool-Memory Conflict (TMC), where the internal parametric knowledge contradicts with the external tool knowledge for tool-augmented LLMs. We find that existing LLMs, though powerful, suffer from TMC, especially on STEM-related tasks. We also uncover that under different conditions, tool knowledge and parametric knowledge may be prioritized differently. We then evaluate existing conflict resolving techniques, including prompting-based and RAG-based methods. Results show that none of these approaches can effectively resolve tool-memory conflicts.

### [305] [Explicating Tacit Regulatory Knowledge from LLMs to Auto-Formalize Requirements for Compliance Test Case Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09762)
*Zhiyi Xue,Xiaohong Chen,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces RAFT, a framework that formalizes complex regulations and generates compliance tests using multiple LLMs in highly regulated domains, outperforming current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Compliance testing is crucial yet manual in regulated domains due to the complexity of translating regulations into test cases. Automation is hindered by LLM hallucinations and costly manual modeling.

Method: RAFT formalizes requirements and generates compliance tests by leveraging tacit regulatory knowledge from multiple LLMs. It uses an Adaptive Purification-Aggregation strategy and creates three artifacts to guide automation: domain meta-model, formal requirements representation, and testability constraints.

Result: Experiments in financial, automotive, and power domains demonstrate RAFT's expert-level performance, surpassing SOTA methods and reducing generation and review time.

Conclusion: RAFT effectively automates compliance testing by integrating multiple LLMs and innovative strategies, offering a high-precision solution to simplify complex regulatory standards.

Abstract: Compliance testing in highly regulated domains is crucial but largely manual, requiring domain experts to translate complex regulations into executable test cases. While large language models (LLMs) show promise for automation, their susceptibility to hallucinations limits reliable application. Existing hybrid approaches mitigate this issue by constraining LLMs with formal models, but still rely on costly manual modeling. To solve this problem, this paper proposes RAFT, a framework for requirements auto-formalization and compliance test generation via explicating tacit regulatory knowledge from multiple LLMs. RAFT employs an Adaptive Purification-Aggregation strategy to explicate tacit regulatory knowledge from multiple LLMs and integrate it into three artifacts: a domain meta-model, a formal requirements representation, and testability constraints. These artifacts are then dynamically injected into prompts to guide high-precision requirement formalization and automated test generation. Experiments across financial, automotive, and power domains show that RAFT achieves expert-level performance, substantially outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods while reducing overall generation and review time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how code style conventions and programming practices impact code quality and evolve in open-source projects.

Method: Analyzed 1,036 popular open-source Java projects on GitHub, tracked adherence to coding standards over time, and identified common violations and trends.

Result: Common violations include Javadoc and Naming issues; repositories following code-style practices showed slightly better adherence. Many violations are not detected by modern tools.

Conclusion: The study highlights critical areas for improving code quality in Java projects, offering insights for developers and suggestions for future improvements in coding practices.

Abstract: Following code style conventions in software projects is essential for maintaining overall code quality. Adhering to these conventions improves maintainability, understandability, and extensibility. Additionally, following best practices during software development enhances performance and reduces the likelihood of errors. This paper analyzes 1,036 popular open-source JAVA projects on GITHUB to study how code style and programming practices are adopted and evolve over time, examining their prevalence and the most common violations. Additionally, we study a subset of active repositories on a monthly basis to track changes in adherence to coding standards over time. We found widespread violations across repositories, with Javadoc and Naming violations being the most common. We also found a significant number of violations of the GOOGLE Java Style Guide in categories often missed by modern static analysis tools. Furthermore, repositories claiming to follow code-style practices exhibited slightly higher overall adherence to code-style and best-practices. The results provide valuable insights into the adoption of code style and programming practices, highlighting key areas for improvement in the open-source development community. Furthermore, the paper identifies important lessons learned and suggests future directions for improving code quality in JAVA projects.

### [308] [On Fun for Teaching Large Programming Courses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09842)
*Walid Maalej*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces ten physical fun activities to teach software development in large lectures, aiming to keep students engaged and help them grasp concepts better.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods in large lecture settings often lead to student disengagement and lack of focus. Fun and interactive activities are proposed to address these challenges, making abstract concepts memorable and more engaging.

Method: The authors developed and implemented a catalogue of ten physical activities related to software development concepts. They evaluated their effectiveness through course deployment (3 years, 500+ students) and interviews with 15 students and 14 educators.

Result: The activities helped students focus, understand, and recall the core programming concepts. They also found that linking activities concisely to the course content improved acceptance and effectiveness.

Conclusion: Fun physical activities can enhance engagement and learning in large lecture settings, although they need to be concise and conceptually relevant to maximize their effectiveness.

Abstract: Teaching software development basics to hundreds of students in a frontal setting is cost-efficient and thus still common in universities. However, in a large lecture hall, students can easily get bored, distracted, and disengaged. The frontal setting can also frustrate lecturers since interaction opportunities are limited and hard to scale. Fun activities can activate students and, if well designed, can also help remember and reflect on abstract software development concepts. We present a novel catalogue of ten physical fun activities, developed over years to reflect on basic programming and software development concepts. The catalogue includes the execution of a LA-OLA algorithm as in stadiums, using paper planes to simulate object messages and pointers, and traversing a lecture hall as a tree or a recursive structure. We report our experience of using the activities in a large course with 500+ students three years in a row. We also conducted an interview study with 15 former students of the course and 14 experienced educators from around the globe. The results suggest that the fun activities can enable students to stay focused, remember key concepts, and reflect afterwards. However, keeping the activities concise and clearly linked to the concepts taught seems to be key to their acceptance and effectiveness.

### [309] [Beyond Strict Rules: Assessing the Effectiveness of Large Language Models for Code Smell Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09873)
*Saymon Souza,Amanda Santana,Eduardo Figueiredo,Igor Muzetti,João Eduardo Montandon,Lionel Briand*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper explores the effectiveness of four large language models for code smell detection in Java projects, proposing a combined strategy that balances recall and precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current code smell detection methods often lack flexibility, and the potential of large language models (LLMs) for this task is underexplored.

Method: The study evaluates four LLMs across nine code smells using a ground-truth dataset created through manual inspections by developers, and proposes a hybrid approach combining LLMs with static analysis tools.

Result: LLMs excel in detecting straightforward code smells but vary in performance for complex smells; the proposed hybrid strategy outperforms in five out of nine smells but generates more false positives for intricate cases.

Conclusion: Different strategies suit different priorities (Recall vs. Precision). The hybrid approach is promising but requires refinement for complex smell detection.

Abstract: Code smells are symptoms of potential code quality problems that may affect software maintainability, thus increasing development costs and impacting software reliability. Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities for supporting various software engineering activities, but their use for detecting code smells remains underexplored. However, unlike the rigid rules of static analysis tools, LLMs can support flexible and adaptable detection strategies tailored to the unique properties of code smells. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of four LLMs -- DeepSeek-R1, GPT-5 mini, Llama-3.3, and Qwen2.5-Code -- for detecting nine code smells across 30 Java projects. For the empirical evaluation, we created a ground-truth dataset by asking 76 developers to manually inspect 268 code-smell candidates. Our results indicate that LLMs perform strongly for structurally straightforward smells, such as Large Class and Long Method. However, we also observed that different LLMs and tools fare better for distinct code smells. We then propose and evaluate a detection strategy that combines LLMs and static analysis tools. The proposed strategy outperforms LLMs and tools in five out of nine code smells in terms of F1-Score. However, it also generates more false positives for complex smells. Therefore, we conclude that the optimal strategy depends on whether Recall or Precision is the main priority for code smell detection.

### [310] [Self-reflection in Automated Qualitative Coding: Improving Text Annotation through Secondary LLM Critique](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09905)
*Zackary Okun Dunivin,Mobina Noori,Seth Frey,Curtis Atkinson*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper presents a two-stage workflow for qualitative coding using large language models (LLMs), improving classification accuracy through self-reflection by a second LLM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the high error rates observed in zero- and few-shot classifiers used for qualitative coding, even with careful prompting. The goal is to enhance precision and usability of LLMs in qualitative tasks.

Method: A two-stage process was proposed. First, an LLM applies a human-designed, adapted codebook. Then, a second LLM critiques the result through self-reflection, reviewing both the source text and the initial rationale before making a final decision.

Result: This workflow was tested on over 3,000 emails from the Apache Software Foundation, with initial LLMs showing false-positive rates of 8%-54%. The second-stage self-reflection reduced errors and improved F1 scores by 0.04-0.25, especially improving poorly performing codes.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that integrating a self-reflection stage can reduce error rates and improve precision in qualitative coding tasks, making LLM annotation processes more reliable and efficient.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) allow for sophisticated qualitative coding of large datasets, but zero- and few-shot classifiers can produce an intolerable number of errors, even with careful, validated prompting. We present a simple, generalizable two-stage workflow: an LLM applies a human-designed, LLM-adapted codebook; a secondary LLM critic performs self-reflection on each positive label by re-reading the source text alongside the first model's rationale and issuing a final decision. We evaluate this approach on six qualitative codes over 3,000 high-content emails from Apache Software Foundation project evaluation discussions. Our human-derived audit of 360 positive annotations (60 passages by six codes) found that the first-line LLM had a false-positive rate of 8% to 54%, despite F1 scores of 0.74 and 1.00 in testing. Subsequent recoding of all stage-one annotations via a second self-reflection stage improved F1 by 0.04 to 0.25, bringing two especially poor performing codes up to 0.69 and 0.79 from 0.52 and 0.55 respectively. Our manual evaluation identified two recurrent error classes: misinterpretation (violations of code definitions) and meta-discussion (debate about a project evaluation criterion mistaken for its use as a decision justification). Code-specific critic clauses addressing observed failure modes were especially effective with testing and refinement, replicating the codebook-adaption process for LLM interpretation in stage-one. We explain how favoring recall in first-line LLM annotation combined with secondary critique delivers precision-first, compute-light control. With human guidance and validation, self-reflection slots into existing LLM-assisted annotation pipelines to reduce noise and potentially salvage unusable classifiers.

*Lianjing Wang,Yufeng Zhang,Kenli Li,Zhenbang Chen,Xu Zhou,Pengfei Wang,Guangning Song,Ji Wang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel hybrid testing framework that improves upon existing tools by better integrating symbolic execution, fuzzing, and sampling. It achieves enhanced testing outcomes, such as higher edge coverage and crash discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of existing hybrid testing tools that either over-prune branches in symbolic execution or improperly use sampling, leading to reduced testing efficiency.

Method: The authors propose a new hybrid testing architecture that balances traditional and tailored symbolic execution engines. Using this architecture, they integrate fuzzing, symbolic execution, and sampling through several key principles, and implement these in their tool, S$^2$F.

Result: The tool S$^2$F achieves an average 6.14% improvement in edge coverage and a 32.6% increase in discovered crashes compared to state-of-the-art tools. Additionally, it identifies three previously unknown crashes.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid testing framework and the S$^2$F tool provide more effective testing capabilities than existing methods, demonstrating improved coverage and crash detection in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Hybrid testing that integrates fuzzing, symbolic execution, and sampling has demonstrated superior testing efficiency compared to individual techniques. However, the state-of-the-art (SOTA) hybrid testing tools do not fully exploit the capabilities of symbolic execution and sampling in two key aspects. First, the SOTA hybrid testing tools employ tailored symbolic execution engines that tend to over-prune branches, leading to considerable time wasted waiting for seeds from the fuzzer and missing opportunities to discover crashes. Second, existing methods do not apply sampling to the appropriate branches and therefore cannot utilize the full capability of sampling. To address these two limitations, we propose a novel hybrid testing architecture that combines the precision of conventional symbolic execution with the scalability of tailored symbolic execution engines. Based on this architecture, we propose several principles for combining fuzzing, symbolic execution, and sampling. We implement our method in a hybrid testing tool S$^2$F. To evaluate its effectiveness, we conduct extensive experiments on 15 real-world programs. Experimental results demonstrate that S$^2$F outperforms the SOTA tool, achieving an average improvement of 6.14% in edge coverage and 32.6% in discovered crashes. Notably, our tool uncovers three previously unknown crashes in real-world programs.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Mark My Works is an LLM-based local autograding system that provides technical feedback and critiques code quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large programming courses lack timely and detailed feedback for student code, which impacts student learning.

Method: The system combines unit testing and LLM-generated explanations using role-based prompts for analysis and feedback generation.

Result: Pilot testing in a 191-student course showed AI assessments aligned qualitatively with human grading but were more conservative and gave detailed feedback.

Conclusion: While the AI system scores more conservatively, its detailed technical feedback makes it a valuable pedagogical tool for large programming courses.

Abstract: Large programming courses struggle to provide timely, detailed feedback on student code. We developed Mark My Works, a local autograding system that combines traditional unit testing with LLM-generated explanations. The system uses role-based prompts to analyze submissions, critique code quality, and generate pedagogical feedback while maintaining transparency in its reasoning process.
  We piloted the system in a 191-student engineering course, comparing AI-generated assessments with human grading on 79 submissions. While AI scores showed no linear correlation with human scores (r = -0.177, p = 0.124), both systems exhibited similar left-skewed distributions, suggesting they recognize comparable quality hierarchies despite different scoring philosophies. The AI system demonstrated more conservative scoring (mean: 59.95 vs 80.53 human) but generated significantly more detailed technical feedback.

*Tsvi Cherny-Shahar,Amiram Yehudai*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Repository Intelligence Graph (RIG), a structured map of repository build and test components, and evaluates its impact on coding agents, showing improved accuracy and efficiency in answering repository questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Coding agents struggle with understanding build and test structures in multilingual repositories due to complex dependencies encoded in heterogeneous systems.

Method: The authors present RIG for mapping repository structures and SPADE to extract and visualize these components from build/test artifacts, including CMake-focused plugins.

Result: Providing RIG significantly improves agent performance—with mean accuracy increasing by 12.2% and efficiency improving by 53.9%. Multilingual repositories see the highest benefit.

Conclusion: RIG enhances agent understanding of repository structure, especially in multilingual projects, though improvements may depend on agents' graph-based reasoning quality.

Abstract: Repository aware coding agents often struggle to recover build and test structure, especially in multilingual projects where cross language dependencies are encoded across heterogeneous build systems and tooling. We introduce the Repository Intelligence Graph (RIG), a deterministic, evidence backed architectural map that represents buildable components, aggregators, runners, tests, external packages, and package managers, connected by explicit dependency and coverage edges that trace back to concrete build and test definitions. We also present SPADE, a deterministic extractor that constructs RIG from build and test artifacts (currently with an automatic CMake plugin based on the CMake File API and CTest metadata), and exposes RIG as an LLM friendly JSON view that agents can treat as the authoritative description of repository structure.
  We evaluate three commercial agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex) on eight repositories spanning low to high build oriented complexity, including the real world MetaFFI project. Each agent answers thirty structured questions per repository with and without RIG in context, and we measure accuracy, wall clock completion time, and efficiency (seconds per correct answer). Across repositories and agents, providing RIG improves mean accuracy by 12.2\% and reduces completion time by 53.9\%, yielding a mean 57.8\% reduction in seconds per correct answer. Gains are larger in multilingual repositories, which improve by 17.7\% in accuracy and 69.5\% in efficiency on average, compared to 6.6\% and 46.1\% in single language repositories. Qualitative analysis suggests that RIG shifts failures from structural misunderstandings toward reasoning mistakes over a correct structure, while rare regressions highlight that graph based reasoning quality remains a key factor.

TL;DR: This paper introduces an online learning approach for dynamic malware detection to address the limitations of current machine learning methods, focusing on adaptability and effectiveness against zero-day threats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing interconnection of computational resources due to Cloud Computing and IoT escalates malware’s rapid spread. Current machine learning methods for malware detection struggle with outdated models and reliance on large labeled datasets, unable to address the evolving malware threats.

Method: The paper develops an online learning framework that continuously updates itself by leveraging temporal information and behavioral features (process resource utilization metrics) for detecting malware.

Result: The online learning approach proves effective in identifying zero-day malware and performs well in limited data availability scenarios, surpassing traditional batch algorithms.

Conclusion: The proposed approach demonstrates adaptability and robustness against evolving malware threats, showing significant promise in improving dynamic malware detection.

Abstract: The rapid growth of Cloud Computing and Internet of Things (IoT) has significantly increased the interconnection of computational resources, creating an environment where malicious software (malware) can spread rapidly. To address this challenge, researchers are increasingly utilizing Machine Learning approaches to identify malware through behavioral (i.e. dynamic) cues. However, current approaches are limited by their reliance on large labeled datasets, fixed model training, and the assumption that a trained model remains effective over time-disregarding the ever-evolving sophistication of malware. As a result, they often fail to detect evolving malware attacks that adapt over time. This paper proposes an online learning approach for dynamic malware detection, that overcomes these limitations by incorporating temporal information to continuously update its models using behavioral features, specifically process resource utilization metrics. By doing so, the proposed models can incrementally adapt to emerging threats and detect zero-day malware effectively. Upon evaluating our approach against traditional batch algorithms, we find it effective in detecting zero-day malware. Moreover, we demonstrate its efficacy in scenarios with limited data availability, where traditional batch-based approaches often struggle to perform reliably.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand how sustained use of AI-powered coding assistants reshapes everyday development practices in professional IDEs, which has been underexplored in existing research.

Method: The study employs a mixed-method approach, analyzing longitudinal telemetry data from 800 developers over two years and conducting a survey with 62 professionals to assess changes in coding workflows.

Result: Findings show that AI users produce significantly more code and delete more as well, with self-reported productivity gains and minimal perceived changes in code quality, editing, reuse, and context switching.

Conclusion: The study provides empirical insights on the long-term workflow changes induced by AI assistants and suggests directions for designing effective AI-augmented development tools.

Abstract: AI-powered coding assistants are rapidly becoming fixtures in professional IDEs, yet their sustained influence on everyday development remains poorly understood. Prior research has focused on short-term use or self-reported perceptions, leaving open questions about how sustained AI use reshapes actual daily coding practices in the long term. We address this gap with a mixed-method study of AI adoption in IDEs, combining longitudinal two-year fine-grained telemetry from 800 developers with a survey of 62 professionals. We analyze five dimensions of workflow change: productivity, code quality, code editing, code reuse, and context switching. Telemetry reveals that AI users produce substantially more code but also delete significantly more. Meanwhile, survey respondents report productivity gains and perceive minimal changes in other dimensions. Our results offer empirical insights into the silent restructuring of software workflows and provide implications for designing future AI-augmented tooling.

### [317] [Model See, Model Do? Exposure-Aware Evaluation of Bug-vs-Fix Preference in Code LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10496)
*Ali Al-Kaswan,Claudio Spiess,Prem Devanbu,Arie van Deursen,Maliheh Izadi*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) for code generation often perpetuate bugs from training data. An evaluation framework was created to assess exposure to buggy or fixed code and its influence on model preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the impact of training data exposure (buggy vs fixed code) on LLMs' performance, ensuring better reliability in code outputs.

Method: An exposure-aware evaluation framework was used with the ManySStuBs4J benchmark and Stack-V2 corpus for training data membership testing. Metrics included code completion and likelihood scoring techniques.

Result: Models reproduce buggy lines more often than fixed ones. Exposure to bugs amplifies errors, while fixes have marginal positive effects. Likelihood scoring shows a mixed bias depending on exposure conditions.

Conclusion: LLMs are influenced by training exposure, often skewing evaluations and risking the propagation of memorized errors in code generation.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used for code generation and debugging, but their outputs can still contain bugs, that originate from training data. Distinguishing whether an LLM prefers correct code, or a familiar incorrect version might be influenced by what it's been exposed to during training. We introduce an exposure-aware evaluation framework that quantifies how prior exposure to buggy versus fixed code influences a model's preference. Using the ManySStuBs4J benchmark, we apply Data Portraits for membership testing on the Stack-V2 corpus to estimate whether each buggy and fixed variant was seen during training. We then stratify examples by exposure and compare model preference using code completion as well as multiple likelihood-based scoring metrics We find that most examples (67%) have neither variant in the training data, and when only one is present, fixes are more frequently present than bugs. In model generations, models reproduce buggy lines far more often than fixes, with bug-exposed examples amplifying this tendency and fix-exposed examples showing only marginal improvement. In likelihood scoring, minimum and maximum token-probability metrics consistently prefer the fixed code across all conditions, indicating a stable bias toward correct fixes. In contrast, metrics like the Gini coefficient reverse preference when only the buggy variant was seen. Our results indicate that exposure can skew bug-fix evaluations and highlight the risk that LLMs may propagate memorised errors in practice.

Motivation: The motivation is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of sampling methods for Gibbs distributions, particularly for challenging scenarios such as multi-modal and non-log-concave distributions.

Method: The method involves replacing traditional kernel density score estimation with a regularized Wasserstein proximal approach. A second-order score-based ODE, inspired by Nesterov acceleration, is used to drive particles, enhancing mixing rates and exploration.

Result: The ARWP method demonstrates high contraction rates, accelerated discrete-time mixing, faster exploration of the distribution tails, and better generalization in Bayesian neural network tasks when compared to other sampling methodologies.

Conclusion: The proposed ARWP method is a more efficient and structured approach for sampling from Gibbs distributions. It improves mixing rates and tail exploration, and shows potential in various applications, outperforming traditional methods like kinetic Langevin sampling.

Abstract: We consider sampling from a Gibbs distribution by evolving a finite number of particles using a particular score estimator rather than Brownian motion. To accelerate the particles, we consider a second-order score-based ODE, similar to Nesterov acceleration. In contrast to traditional kernel density score estimation, we use the recently proposed regularized Wasserstein proximal method, yielding the Accelerated Regularized Wasserstein Proximal method (ARWP). We provide a detailed analysis of continuous- and discrete-time non-asymptotic and asymptotic mixing rates for Gaussian initial and target distributions, using techniques from Euclidean acceleration and accelerated information gradients. Compared with the kinetic Langevin sampling algorithm, the proposed algorithm exhibits a higher contraction rate in the asymptotic time regime. Numerical experiments are conducted across various low-dimensional experiments, including multi-modal Gaussian mixtures and ill-conditioned Rosenbrock distributions. ARWP exhibits structured and convergent particles, accelerated discrete-time mixing, and faster tail exploration than the non-accelerated regularized Wasserstein proximal method and kinetic Langevin methods. Additionally, ARWP particles exhibit better generalization properties for some non-log-concave Bayesian neural network tasks.

### [319] [CROCS: A Two-Stage Clustering Framework for Behaviour-Centric Consumer Segmentation with Smart Meter Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10494)
*Luke W. Yerbury,Ricardo J. G. B. Campello,G. C. Livingston,Mark Goldsworthy,Lachlan O'Neil*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces CROCS, a two-stage clustering framework for effective consumer segmentation in demand-side management and demand response programs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With smart meters increasingly deployed worldwide, the authors aim to better utilize consumption data to address challenges in demand-side management like behavioral diversity, anomalies, and large-scale segmentation.

Method: The proposed method, CROCS, consists of two stages: clustering individual daily load profiles into Representative Load Sets (RLS) and applying Weighted Sum of Minimum Distances (WSMD) for broader consumer clustering and community detection.

Result: Extensive experiments on synthetic and real smart meter data demonstrate CROCS' ability to robustly handle intra-consumer variability, anomalies, asynchronous behaviors, and missing data while scaling efficiently.

Conclusion: CROCS improves consumer segmentation for DSM and DR programs, offering interpretable clusters and addressing key challenges in the presence of diverse and irregular consumption behaviors.

Abstract: With grid operators confronting rising uncertainty from renewable integration and a broader push toward electrification, Demand-Side Management (DSM) -- particularly Demand Response (DR) -- has attracted significant attention as a cost-effective mechanism for balancing modern electricity systems. Unprecedented volumes of consumption data from a continuing global deployment of smart meters enable consumer segmentation based on real usage behaviours, promising to inform the design of more effective DSM and DR programs. However, existing clustering-based segmentation methods insufficiently reflect the behavioural diversity of consumers, often relying on rigid temporal alignment, and faltering in the presence of anomalies, missing data, or large-scale deployments.
  To address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage clustering framework -- Clustered Representations Optimising Consumer Segmentation (CROCS). In the first stage, each consumer's daily load profiles are clustered independently to form a Representative Load Set (RLS), providing a compact summary of their typical diurnal consumption behaviours. In the second stage, consumers are clustered using the Weighted Sum of Minimum Distances (WSMD), a novel set-to-set measure that compares RLSs by accounting for both the prevalence and similarity of those behaviours. Finally, community detection on the WSMD-induced graph reveals higher-order prototypes that embody the shared diurnal behaviours defining consumer groups, enhancing the interpretability of the resulting clusters.
  Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real Australian smart meter datasets demonstrate that CROCS captures intra-consumer variability, uncovers both synchronous and asynchronous behavioural similarities, and remains robust to anomalies and missing data, while scaling efficiently through natural parallelisation.

*Francisco Madaleno,Pratik Misra,Alex Markham*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The study advances causal abstraction in DAG models by presenting identifiability results, an efficient algorithm, and theoretical insights into search structures, validated through synthetic and real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Causal models at a fine granularity might not always be feasible for practical applications, necessitating abstraction methods to address such challenges.

Method: The paper introduces novel graphical identifiability results, designs a consistent algorithm for learning abstract causal graphs from data with unknown interventions, and explores the lattice structure of the search space.

Result: The proposed methods were applied to synthetic and real datasets, successfully identifying causal graphs and validating theoretical findings using controlled physical systems.

Conclusion: The research establishes practical tools for efficiently learning abstract causal relationships, with implications for broader fields of causal discovery and analysis.

Abstract: Directed acyclic graphical (DAG) models are a powerful tool for representing causal relationships among jointly distributed random variables, especially concerning data from across different experimental settings. However, it is not always practical or desirable to estimate a causal model at the granularity of given features in a particular dataset. There is a growing body of research on causal abstraction to address such problems. We contribute to this line of research by (i) providing novel graphical identifiability results for practically-relevant interventional settings, (ii) proposing an efficient, provably consistent algorithm for directly learning abstract causal graphs from interventional data with unknown intervention targets, and (iii) uncovering theoretical insights about the lattice structure of the underlying search space, with connections to the field of causal discovery more generally. As proof of concept, we apply our algorithm on synthetic and real datasets with known ground truths, including measurements from a controlled physical system with interacting light intensity and polarization.

### [321] [Parametric RDT approach to computational gap of symmetric binary perceptron](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10628)
*Mihailo Stojnic*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper examines statistical-computational gaps (SCG) in symmetric binary perceptrons using fully lifted random duality theory, identifying a possible computational gap due to structural changes in constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the existence of statistical-computational gaps in symmetric binary perceptrons and connect these gaps with structural constraint changes using advanced theoretical tools.

Method: The study utilizes fully lifted random duality theory (fl-RDT) with parametric settings across lifting levels and confirms findings through algorithmic performance and theoretical predictions.

Result: It identifies a computational gap $SCG=\alpha_c-\alpha_a$ between satisfiability and algorithmic thresholds, obtaining $\alpha_c\approx 1.8159$ and $\alpha_a\approx 1.6021$. Results align well with existing predictions and literature, including local entropy and OGP analyses.

Conclusion: The theoretical and algorithmic findings validate the existence of computational gaps in symmetric binary perceptrons and demonstrate practical algorithmic consistency with theoretical predictions.

Abstract: We study potential presence of statistical-computational gaps (SCG) in symmetric binary perceptrons (SBP) via a parametric utilization of \emph{fully lifted random duality theory} (fl-RDT) [96]. A structural change from decreasingly to arbitrarily ordered $c$-sequence (a key fl-RDT parametric component) is observed on the second lifting level and associated with \emph{satisfiability} ($α_c$) -- \emph{algorithmic} ($α_a$) constraints density threshold change thereby suggesting a potential existence of a nonzero computational gap $SCG=α_c-α_a$. The second level estimate is shown to match the theoretical $α_c$ whereas the $r\rightarrow \infty$ level one is proposed to correspond to $α_a$. For example, for the canonical SBP ($κ=1$ margin) we obtain $α_c\approx 1.8159$ on the second and $α_a\approx 1.6021$ (with converging tendency towards $\sim 1.59$ range) on the seventh level. Our propositions remarkably well concur with recent literature: (i) in [20] local entropy replica approach predicts $α_{LE}\approx 1.58$ as the onset of clustering defragmentation (presumed driving force behind locally improving algorithms failures); (ii) in $α\rightarrow 0$ regime we obtain on the third lifting level $κ\approx 1.2385\sqrt{\frac{α_a}{-\log\left ( α_a \right ) }}$ which qualitatively matches overlap gap property (OGP) based predictions of [43] and identically matches local entropy based predictions of [24]; (iii) $c$-sequence ordering change phenomenology mirrors the one observed in asymmetric binary perceptron (ABP) in [98] and the negative Hopfield model in [100]; and (iv) as in [98,100], we here design a CLuP based algorithm whose practical performance closely matches proposed theoretical predictions.

### [322] [Classification Imbalance as Transfer Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10630)
*Eric Xia,Jason M. Klusowski*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper investigates classification imbalance in data and compares oversampling methods, particularly analyzing SMOTE and bootstrapping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand and address the challenges associated with classification imbalance, particularly in scenarios where synthetic oversampling is used.

Method: The authors frame the problem as a transfer learning under label shift, analyze the theoretical excess risk, compare SMOTE and bootstrapping, and corroborate findings with experiments.

Result: They find that SMOTE performs worse than bootstrapping in moderately high dimensions due to higher costs of transfer, impacting its efficacy in balanced training.

Conclusion: Bootstrapping is generally more effective than SMOTE in high-dimensional settings, and the paper helps guide the choice of augmentation methods for imbalanced classification.

Abstract: Classification imbalance arises when one class is much rarer than the other. We frame this setting as transfer learning under label (prior) shift between an imbalanced source distribution induced by the observed data and a balanced target distribution under which performance is evaluated. Within this framework, we study a family of oversampling procedures that augment the training data by generating synthetic samples from an estimated minority-class distribution to roughly balance the classes, among which the celebrated SMOTE algorithm is a canonical example. We show that the excess risk decomposes into the rate achievable under balanced training (as if the data had been drawn from the balanced target distribution) and an additional term, the cost of transfer, which quantifies the discrepancy between the estimated and true minority-class distributions. In particular, we show that the cost of transfer for SMOTE dominates that of bootstrapping (random oversampling) in moderately high dimensions, suggesting that we should expect bootstrapping to have better performance than SMOTE in general. We corroborate these findings with experimental evidence. More broadly, our results provide guidance for choosing among augmentation strategies for imbalanced classification.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SODACER, a reinforcement learning framework combining dual-buffer experience replay, clustering mechanisms, Control Barrier Functions, and the Sophia optimizer for scalable, safe control of nonlinear systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in achieving safe and scalable optimization for nonlinear dynamic systems while ensuring sample efficiency and robust learning.

Method: Utilized a dual-buffer system (Fast-Buffer for rapid updates and Slow-Buffer with adaptive clustering), integrated Control Barrier Functions for safety, and employed the Sophia optimizer for stability in reinforcement learning processes.

Result: Validated on the HPV transmission model, SODACER showed superior performance in convergence speed, sample efficiency, and bias-variance trade-off compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: SODACER is a reliable and efficient method that ensures safe and scalable reinforcement learning, applicable to fields like robotics and healthcare.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel reinforcement learning framework, named Self-Organizing Dual-buffer Adaptive Clustering Experience Replay (SODACER), designed to achieve safe and scalable optimal control of nonlinear systems. The proposed SODACER mechanism consisting of a Fast-Buffer for rapid adaptation to recent experiences and a Slow-Buffer equipped with a self-organizing adaptive clustering mechanism to maintain diverse and non-redundant historical experiences. The adaptive clustering mechanism dynamically prunes redundant samples, optimizing memory efficiency while retaining critical environmental patterns. The approach integrates SODASER with Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to guarantee safety by enforcing state and input constraints throughout the learning process. To enhance convergence and stability, the framework is combined with the Sophia optimizer, enabling adaptive second-order gradient updates. The proposed SODACER-Sophia's architecture ensures reliable, effective, and robust learning in dynamic, safety-critical environments, offering a generalizable solution for applications in robotics, healthcare, and large-scale system optimization. The proposed approach is validated on a nonlinear Human Papillomavirus (HPV) transmission model with multiple control inputs and safety constraints. Comparative evaluations against random and clustering-based experience replay methods demonstrate that SODACER achieves faster convergence, improved sample efficiency, and a superior bias-variance trade-off, while maintaining safe system trajectories, validated via the Friedman test.

*Angel Yanguas-Gil*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: This paper examines the ability of reasoning large language models (LLMs) to autonomously optimize atomic layer deposition processes by interacting iteratively with an ALD reactor in an unsupervised manner.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore whether reasoning LLMs can effectively and autonomously optimize ALD processes, given the importance of optimizing dose times in these processes without any prior knowledge or supervision.

Method: The study involves an agent built on reasoning LLMs like OpenAI's o3 and GPT5, which iteratively interact with a simulated ALD tool featuring processes with self-limited reaction pathways and non-self-limited components. A two-step process is used to analyze the agent's logic: open-response reasoning followed by structured output conversion.

Result: The agent consistently performed well in optimizing the ALD processes, demonstrating sound logic based on self-limited process principles, but exhibited variability due to the non-deterministic nature of the model's responses.

Conclusion: Reasoning LLMs show promise in autonomously optimizing ALD processes. However, challenges like response variability and occasional misdirection from prior choices remain. Their logic aligns with domain-specific principles, supporting their potential in this task.

Abstract: In this work we explore the performance and behavior of reasoning large language models to autonomously optimize atomic layer deposition (ALD) processes. In the ALD process optimization task, an agent built on top of a reasoning LLM has to find optimal dose times for an ALD precursor and a coreactant without any prior knowledge on the process, including whether it is actually self-limited. The agent is meant to interact iteratively with an ALD reactor in a fully unsupervised way. We evaluate this agent using a simple model of an ALD tool that incorporates ALD processes with different self-limited surface reaction pathways as well as a non self-limited component. Our results show that agents based on reasoning models like OpenAI's o3 and GPT5 consistently succeeded at completing this optimization task. However, we observed significant run-to-run variability due to the non deterministic nature of the model's response. In order to understand the logic followed by the reasoning model, the agent uses a two step process in which the model first generates an open response detailing the reasoning process. This response is then transformed into a structured output. An analysis of these reasoning traces showed that the logic of the model was sound and that its reasoning was based on the notions of self-limited process and saturation expected in the case of ALD. However, the agent can sometimes be misled by its own prior choices when exploring the optimization space.

### [325] [Differentially Private Inference for Longitudinal Linear Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10626)
*Getoar Sopa,Marco Avella Medina,Cynthia Rush*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: This paper presents a user-level differential privacy framework for longitudinal linear regression by introducing methods with strong theoretical guarantees and practical performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for differential privacy in linear regression primarily focus on item-level data, failing to protect individuals contributing multiple dependent observations (e.g., in longitudinal data).

Method: A user-level private regression estimator is introduced through aggregation of local regressions, supported by a bias-corrected covariance estimator for inference that accounts for dependence and heteroskedasticity.

Result: Finite-sample guarantees and asymptotic normality under short-range dependence are established, offering the first unified user-level DP framework for longitudinal data regression.

Conclusion: The framework ensures strong user-level privacy with reliable estimation and inference, making it a significant contribution to practical DP applications in longitudinal data with theoretical and empirical validation.

Abstract: Differential Privacy (DP) provides a rigorous framework for releasing statistics while protecting individual information present in a dataset. Although substantial progress has been made on differentially private linear regression, existing methods almost exclusively address the item-level DP setting, where each user contributes a single observation. Many scientific and economic applications instead involve longitudinal or panel data, in which each user contributes multiple dependent observations. In these settings, item-level DP offers inadequate protection, and user-level DP - shielding an individual's entire trajectory - is the appropriate privacy notion. We develop a comprehensive framework for estimation and inference in longitudinal linear regression under user-level DP. We propose a user-level private regression estimator based on aggregating local regressions, and we establish finite-sample guarantees and asymptotic normality under short-range dependence. For inference, we develop a privatized, bias-corrected covariance estimator that is automatically heteroskedasticity- and autocorrelation-consistent. These results provide the first unified framework for practical user-level DP estimation and inference in longitudinal linear regression under dependence, with strong theoretical guarantees and promising empirical performance.

*Lorenzo Monti,Tatiana Muraveva,Brian Sheridan,Davide Massari,Alessia Garofalo,Gisella Clementini,Umberto Michelucci*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper presents CLiMB, a framework for bridging the gap between supervised and unsupervised clustering by decoupling prior knowledge exploitation and new anomaly exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current semi-supervised clustering algorithms in handling well-characterized phenomena and detecting novel anomalies.

Method: The CLiMB framework employs a two-phase approach: constrained partitioning for known clusters and density-based clustering for novel data structures.

Result: Achieved an Adjusted Rand Index of 0.829 on Gaia Data, outperforming baselines, and identified three novel dynamical features (Shiva, Shakti, Galactic Disk).

Conclusion: CLiMB effectively balances classification of known structures with identification of novel anomalies, enhancing its utility for scientific discovery.

Abstract: In data-driven scientific discovery, a challenge lies in classifying well-characterized phenomena while identifying novel anomalies. Current semi-supervised clustering algorithms do not always fully address this duality, often assuming that supervisory signals are globally representative. Consequently, methods often enforce rigid constraints that suppress unanticipated patterns or require a pre-specified number of clusters, rendering them ineffective for genuine novelty detection. To bridge this gap, we introduce CLiMB (CLustering in Multiphase Boundaries), a domain-informed framework decoupling the exploitation of prior knowledge from the exploration of unknown structures. Using a sequential two-phase approach, CLiMB first anchors known clusters using constrained partitioning, and subsequently applies density-based clustering to residual data to reveal arbitrary topologies. We demonstrate this framework on RR Lyrae stars data from the Gaia Data Release 3. CLiMB attains an Adjusted Rand Index of 0.829 with 90% seed coverage in recovering known Milky Way substructures, drastically outperforming heuristic and constraint-based baselines, which stagnate below 0.20. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis confirms CLiMB's superior data efficiency, showing monotonic improvement as knowledge increases. Finally, the framework successfully isolates three dynamical features (Shiva, Shakti, and the Galactic Disk) in the unlabelled field, validating its potential for scientific discovery.

*Yuan-Sen Ting,André Curtis-Trudel,Siyu Yao*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper discusses the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into astronomical research, emphasizing philosophical tools to navigate epistemological challenges, rather than treating AI purely as an engineering solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing influence of AI in astronomy by exploring its epistemological impacts and establishing philosophical frameworks for its integration.

Method: Derived insights from an interdisciplinary workshop involving astronomers, philosophers, and computer scientists to identify tensions and propose solutions.

Result: Highlighted five tensions regarding the role of AI in astronomy, such as misconceptualizing scientific understanding, the role of narrative and human judgment, and the risks of shifting research goals based on AI's capabilities.

Conclusion: Proposed 'pragmatic understanding' as a framework for integrating AI into astronomy, emphasizing the need for new norms to ensure meaningful scientific advancements while leveraging AI tools effectively.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is rapidly transforming astronomical research, yet the scientific community has largely treated this transformation as an engineering challenge rather than an epistemological one. This perspective article argues that philosophy of science offers essential tools for navigating AI's integration into astronomy--conceptual clarity about what "understanding" means, critical examination of assumptions about data and discovery, and frameworks for evaluating AI's roles across different research contexts. Drawing on an interdisciplinary workshop convening astronomers, philosophers, and computer scientists, we identify several tensions. First, the narrative that AI will "derive fundamental physics" from data misconstrues contemporary astronomy as equation-derivation rather than the observation-driven enterprise it is. Second, scientific understanding involves more than prediction--it requires narrative construction, contextual judgment, and communicative achievement that current AI architectures struggle to provide. Third, because narrative and judgment matter, human peer review remains essential--yet AI-generated content flooding the literature threatens our capacity to identify genuine insight. Fourth, while AI excels at well-defined problem-solving, the ill-defined problem-finding that drives breakthroughs appears to require capacities beyond pattern recognition. Fifth, as AI accelerates what is feasible, pursuitworthiness criteria risk shifting toward what AI makes easy rather than what is genuinely important. We propose "pragmatic understanding" as a framework for integration--recognizing AI as a tool that extends human cognition while requiring new norms for validation and epistemic evaluation. Engaging with these questions now may help the community shape the transformation rather than merely react to it.

TL;DR: The paper addresses concerns about automated AI tools in scientific evaluation, advocating for a critical and pragmatic approach to their usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing challenges such as peer review crises, flawed replication of studies, and the emergence of AI-fabricated science drive the need for efficient automated tools.

Method: The author suggests adopting a social, pragmatist epistemology called Critically Engaged Pragmatism to assess AI tools' reliability and their role in science.

Result: AI tools are prone to misuse due to unclear purposes and technical biases, risking false credibility markers without proper scrutiny.

Conclusion: AI tools should be critically examined and used as support to scientific communities' credibility practices, rather than seen as definitive evaluators.

Abstract: Crises in peer review capacity, study replication, and AI-fabricated science have intensified interest in automated tools for assessing scientific research. However, the scientific community has a history of decontextualizing and repurposing credibility markers in inapt ways. I caution that AI science evaluation tools are particularly prone to these kinds of inference by false ascent due to contestation about the purposes to which they should be put, their portability across purposes, and technical demands that prioritize data set size over epistemic fit. To counter this, I argue for a social, pragmatist epistemology and a newly articulated norm of Critically Engaged Pragmatism to enjoin scientific communities to vigorously scrutinize the purposes and purpose-specific reliability of AI science evaluation tools. Under this framework, AI science evaluation tools are not objective arbiters of scientific credibility, but the object of the kinds of critical discursive practices that ground the credibility of scientific communities.

Here, I outline what a theory of judicial review would look like in an era of artificial intelligence, analyzing both the limitations and the possibilities of judicial review of AI. I draw on cases in which AI decision-making has been challenged in courts, to show how concepts of due process and equal protection can be recuperated in a modern AI era, and even integrated into AI, to provide for better oversight and accountability, offering a framework for judicial review in the AI era that protects minorities from algorithmic discrimination.

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: The study addresses batch effects in genomic diagnostics, introducing a method to cluster samples using Bayesian model evidence to separate technical artifacts from biological variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Batch effects are a major concern in genomic diagnostics as they lead to false positive or masked pathogenic CNV calls, jeopardizing clinical reliability. Existing solutions are limited as they conflate signals or require unavailable batch labels.

Method: A new method clusters samples based on Bayesian model evidence. Using likelihood ratio tests on evidence values ensures compatibility with model assumptions while distinguishing technical batch effects from biological signals.

Result: The method showed robust Type I error control on synthetic data, validating superior performance on clinical panels and demonstrating cross-modality adaptability using mouse electrophysiology recordings.

Conclusion: This approach offers improved clustering accuracy over standard techniques, retains clinical conservativeness, and effectively separates technical artifacts from biological variations for reliable genomic diagnostics.

Abstract: Batch effects represent a major confounder in genomic diagnostics. In copy number variant (CNV) detection from NGS, many algorithms compare read depth between test samples and a reference sample, assuming they are process-matched. When this assumption is violated, with causes ranging from reagent lot changes to multi-site processing, the reference becomes inappropriate, introducing false CNV calls or masking true pathogenic variants. Detecting such heterogeneity before downstream analysis is critical for reliable clinical interpretation. Existing batch effect detection methods either cluster samples based on raw features, risking conflation of biological signal with technical variation, or require known batch labels that are frequently unavailable. We introduce a method that addresses both limitations by clustering samples according to their Bayesian model evidence. The central insight is that evidence quantifies compatibility between data and model assumptions, technical artifacts violate assumptions and reduce evidence, whereas biological variation, including CNV status, is anticipated by the model and yields high evidence. This asymmetry provides a discriminative signal that separates batch effects from biology. We formalize heterogeneity detection as a likelihood ratio test for mixture structure in evidence space, using parametric bootstrap calibration to ensure conservative false positive rates. We validate our approach on synthetic data demonstrating proper Type I error control, three clinical targeted sequencing panels (liquid biopsy, BRCA, and thalassemia) exhibiting distinct batch effect mechanisms, and mouse electrophysiology recordings demonstrating cross-modality generalization. Our method achieves superior clustering accuracy compared to standard correlation-based and dimensionality-reduction approaches while maintaining the conservativeness required for clinical usage.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a transformer-based neural network decoder tailored for parallel window decoding in fault-tolerant quantum computation, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and high throughput efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural network decoders, despite their high accuracy, face challenges in real-time processing due to lack of parallelism and integration with advanced decoding schemes, limiting their utility in fault-tolerant quantum computation.

Method: The authors train a recurrent, transformer-based neural network for parallel window decoding, using local corrections for training and enabling the network to self-coordinate across neighboring decoding windows.

Result: The decoder attains superior accuracy and scalability in quantum memory experiments. It demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on Zuchongzhi 3.2 and achieves decoding of surface codes with distances up to 25 within 1 microsecond using a single TPU v6e.

Conclusion: This work resolves the throughput limitations of previous neural network decoders, provides a scalable and accurate parallel decoding framework, and establishes feasibility for real-time quantum error correction in fault-tolerant quantum computation.

Abstract: Fast, reliable decoders are pivotal components for enabling fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC). Neural network decoders like AlphaQubit have demonstrated potential, achieving higher accuracy than traditional human-designed decoding algorithms. However, existing implementations of neural network decoders lack the parallelism required to decode the syndrome stream generated by a superconducting logical qubit in real time. Moreover, integrating AlphaQubit with sliding window-based parallel decoding schemes presents non-trivial challenges: AlphaQubit is trained solely to output a single bit corresponding to the global logical correction for an entire memory experiment, rather than local physical corrections that can be easily integrated. We address this issue by training a recurrent, transformer-based neural network specifically tailored for parallel window decoding. While it still outputs a single bit, we derive training labels from a consistent set of local corrections and train on various types of decoding windows simultaneously. This approach enables the network to self-coordinate across neighboring windows, facilitating high-accuracy parallel decoding of arbitrarily long memory experiments.
  As a result, we overcome the throughput bottleneck that previously precluded the use of AlphaQubit-type decoders in FTQC. Our work presents the first scalable, neural-network-based parallel decoding framework that simultaneously achieves SOTA accuracy and the stringent throughput required for real-time quantum error correction. Using an end-to-end experimental workflow, we benchmark our decoder on the Zuchongzhi 3.2 superconducting quantum processor on surface codes with distances up to 7, demonstrating its superior accuracy. Moreover, we demonstrate that, using our approach, a single TPU v6e is capable of decoding surface codes with distances up to 25 within 1us per decoding round.

*Eyad I. B Hamid*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new quantum algorithm architecture, H-EFT-VA, to address the Barren Plateau problem. It achieves better gradient variance and performance for quantum systems while maintaining key quantum entanglement properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper is to overcome the Barren Plateau (BP) problem found in Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs), which hinders optimization by causing exponentially vanishing gradient variance.

Method: The proposed method, H-EFT Variational Ansatz (H-EFT-VA), leverages principles inspired by Effective Field Theory. It utilizes hierarchical initialization constraints and avoids unitary 2-designs, which theoretically guarantees an inverse-polynomial lower bound on gradient variance while retaining desirable quantum properties.

Result: The paper's benchmarking across complex quantum systems demonstrates that H-EFT-VA outperforms traditional ansatzes, achieving significant improvements in energy convergence (109x improvement) and ground-state fidelity (10.7x improvement) with extremely high statistical significance.

Conclusion: H-EFT-VA effectively combats the Barren Plateau problem, advancing Variational Quantum Algorithms without sacrificing expressibility or entanglement capabilities.

Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are critically threatened by the Barren Plateau (BP) phenomenon. In this work, we introduce the H-EFT Variational Ansatz (H-EFT-VA), an architecture inspired by Effective Field Theory (EFT). By enforcing a hierarchical "UV-cutoff" on initialization, we theoretically restrict the circuit's state exploration, preventing the formation of approximate unitary 2-designs. We provide a rigorous proof that this localization guarantees an inverse-polynomial lower bound on the gradient variance: $Var[\partial θ] \in Ω(1/poly(N))$. Crucially, unlike approaches that avoid BPs by limiting entanglement, we demonstrate that H-EFT-VA maintains volume-law entanglement and near-Haar purity, ensuring sufficient expressibility for complex quantum states. Extensive benchmarking across 16 experiments -- including Transverse Field Ising and Heisenberg XXZ models -- confirms a 109x improvement in energy convergence and a 10.7x increase in ground-state fidelity over standard Hardware-Efficient Ansatze (HEA), with a statistical significance of $p < 10^{-88}$.

TL;DR: The study proposes a test to explore potential quantum or nonclassical phenomena in neural information processing using a model-agnostic method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unresolved question of whether neural computation involves quantum or classical processes and propose a test that navigates beyond microscopic assumptions to examine neural representations.

Method: Developed an information-theoretic, Bell-type consistency test applied in latent space of neural models (e.g., autoencoders) to check if decoding statistics align with a single latent-variable distribution.

Result: The study provides a framework to experimentally test quantum-like signatures in information processing through constraints on neural computation.

Conclusion: Shifting the investigation of neural quantum-like behavior from microscopic to information processing constraints opens a new dimension for studying neural computation's fundamental physics.

Abstract: Whether neural information processing is entirely classical or involves quantum-mechanical elements remains an open question. Here we propose a model-agnostic, information-theoretic test of nonclassicality that bypasses microscopic assumptions and instead probes the structure of neural representations themselves. Using autoencoders as a transparent model system, we introduce a Bell-type consistency test in latent space, and ask whether decoding statistics obtained under multiple readout contexts can be jointly explained by a single positive latent-variable distribution. By shifting the search for quantum-like signatures in neural systems from microscopic dynamics to experimentally testable constraints on information processing, this work opens a new route for probing the fundamental physics of neural computation.

### [334] [A Generalizable Framework for Building Executable Domain-Specific LLMs under Data Scarcity: Demonstration on Semiconductor TCAD Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10128)
*Di Wang,Zhenhua Wu,Yu Liu,Kai Chang,Shaohua Wu*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: The paper proposes a schema-first framework for building compact, executable domain-specific LLMs in data-scarce professional settings, developing TcadGPT for semiconductor domain and showing high accuracy with released resources for reproducibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address data scarcity and strict executability requirements in specialized professional and scientific domains, where models need both fluent syntax and compilable scripts.

Method: The framework incorporates three components: (1) generating synthetic QA data to build domain knowledge, (2) optimizing code executability through an interpretable code transformation and preference optimization workflow, and (3) evaluating the impact of retrieval-augmented generation.

Result: The framework was applied to TcadGPT and improved its semantic accuracy (85.6%) and syntax pass rate (80.0%), outperforming GPT-4o. Similar improvements were noted for an additional solver, demonstrating portability.

Conclusion: The framework offers a reproducible approach to develop reliable, executable LLMs for resource-constrained and specialized domains, with datasets and benchmarks made publicly available for further innovation.

Abstract: Scientific and engineering verticals often suffer from data scarcity and strict executability requirements: models must generate not only fluent text, but also syntactically valid, tool-compilable scripts. We present a schema-first alignment framework for building compact, executable domain-specific LLMs in low-resource settings. The framework integrates three core components: (i) large-scale synthetic QA data generation from expert documentation to instill foundational domain knowledge; (ii) a code-centric IR->DPO workflow that converts verified tool decks into interpretable intermediate representations (IR), performs equivalence-preserving diversification, and constructs preference pairs to directly optimize instruction compliance and code executability; and (iii) a controlled evaluation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), showing that while RAG benefits general LLMs, it can marginally degrade the performance of already domain-aligned models.
  We demonstrate the framework by instantiating TcadGPT for semiconductor Technology Computer-Aided Design (TCAD). Using 1.5M synthetic QA pairs and an IR-driven DPO dataset, TcadGPT attains 85.6% semantic accuracy and an 80.0% syntax pass rate on SDE executability tests, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art general LLMs such as GPT-4o. To probe portability beyond TCAD, we apply the same recipe to the open-source FEM solver Elmer, observing consistent improvements in script-level success rates over general-purpose baselines. All datasets, benchmarks, and code (including P1, P2, and IR->DPO) are released for reproducibility. Together, these results suggest that the proposed framework provides a robust and reproducible path toward executable LLMs in specialized, data-scarce professional domains.

### [335] [Chebyshev Accelerated Subspsace Eigensolver for Pseudo-hermitian Hamiltonians](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10557)
*Edoardo Di Napoli,Clément Richefort,Xinzhe Wu*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: This study extends the ChASE eigensolver to pseudo-hermitian Hamiltonians with efficient parallel implementation, enabling computation of several extreme eigenpairs for excitonic materials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the need for efficient computation of thousands of eigenpairs in pseudo-hermitian Hamiltonians, particularly for studying optoelectronic structures in excitonic materials.

Method: It extends the ChASE algorithm to pseudo-hermitian systems using an oblique Rayleigh-Ritz projection, quadratic Ritz-value convergence, and a parallel Chebyshev filter with optimized matrix-product operations.

Result: The extended ChASE eigensolver achieves similar convergence and performance as its hermitian counterpart, validated by numerical and experimental tests.

Conclusion: The proposed solver provides a scalable, efficient solution for computing eigenpairs in pseudo-hermitian systems, essential for simulations in excitonic material studies.

Abstract: Studying the optoelectronic structure of materials can require the computation of up to several thousands of the smallest eigenpairs of a pseudo-hermitian Hamiltonian. Iterative eigensolvers may be preferred over direct methods for this task since their complexity is a function of the desired fraction of the spectrum. In addition, they generally rely on highly optimized and scalable kernels such as matrix-vector multiplications that leverage the massive parallelism and the computational power of modern exascale systems. \textit{Chebyshev Accelerated Subspace iteration Eigensolver} (ChASE) is able to compute several thousands of the most extreme eigenpairs of dense hermitian matrices with proven scalability over massive parallel accelerated clusters. This work presents an extension of ChASE to solve for a portion of the spectrum of pseudo-hermitian Hamiltonians as they appear in the treatment of excitonic materials. The new pseudo-hermitian solver achieves similar convergence and performance as the hermitian one. By exploiting the numerical structure and spectral properties of the Hamiltonian matrix, we propose an oblique variant of Rayleigh-Ritz projection featuring quadratic convergence of the Ritz-values with no explicit construction of the dual basis set. Additionally, we introduce a parallel implementation of the recursive matrix-product operation appearing in the Chebyshev filter with limited amount of global communications. Our development is supported by a full numerical analysis and experimental tests.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight the distinct characteristics of optimization problems in ML and SciML and to address the gap in adapting optimization techniques to physics-constrained SciML models.

Method: The paper reviews and contrasts first- and second-order optimization techniques, examines deterministic and stochastic methods, and provides tutorial examples for SciML models.

Result: The paper provides a unified understanding of how optimization differs in ML and SciML, and showcases strategies tailored to SciML's unique challenges.

Conclusion: Understanding the structure of optimization problems in SciML can guide the development of effective, curvature-aware, or deterministic methods, while addressing unanswered questions for future research.

Abstract: Optimization is central to both modern machine learning (ML) and scientific machine learning (SciML), yet the structure of the underlying optimization problems differs substantially across these domains. Classical ML typically relies on stochastic, sample-separable objectives that favor first-order and adaptive gradient methods. In contrast, SciML often involves physics-informed or operator-constrained formulations in which differential operators induce global coupling, stiffness, and strong anisotropy in the loss landscape. As a result, optimization behavior in SciML is governed by the spectral properties of the underlying physical models rather than by data statistics, frequently limiting the effectiveness of standard stochastic methods and motivating deterministic or curvature-aware approaches. This document provides a unified introduction to optimization methods in ML and SciML, emphasizing how problem structure shapes algorithmic choices. We review first- and second-order optimization techniques in both deterministic and stochastic settings, discuss their adaptation to physics-constrained and data-driven SciML models, and illustrate practical strategies through tutorial examples, while highlighting open research directions at the interface of scientific computing and scientific machine learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for speech-driven 3D facial animation are limited to discrete emotion categories, hindering continuous and nuanced emotional control.

Method: EditEmoTalk employs a boundary-aware semantic embedding to facilitate continuous emotion manipulation on facial animation. It incorporates an emotional consistency loss to ensure motion dynamics align with the desired emotional embedding.

Result: EditEmoTalk demonstrates superior emotional controllability, expressiveness, and generalization while achieving accurate lip synchronization.

Conclusion: This framework advances speech-driven 3D facial animation by enabling fine-grained emotional control and seamless motion manipulation, improving expressiveness and precision.

Abstract: Speech-driven 3D facial animation aims to generate realistic and expressive facial motions directly from audio. While recent methods achieve high-quality lip synchronization, they often rely on discrete emotion categories, limiting continuous and fine-grained emotional control. We present EditEmoTalk, a controllable speech-driven 3D facial animation framework with continuous emotion editing. The key idea is a boundary-aware semantic embedding that learns the normal directions of inter-emotion decision boundaries, enabling a continuous expression manifold for smooth emotion manipulation. Moreover, we introduce an emotional consistency loss that enforces semantic alignment between the generated motion dynamics and the target emotion embedding through a mapping network, ensuring faithful emotional expression. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EditEmoTalk achieves superior controllability, expressiveness, and generalization while maintaining accurate lip synchronization. Code and pretrained models will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to evaluate the perceptual quality impact of using LCEVC as an enhancement layer for Versatile Video Coding, addressing performance across various bitrates and resolutions.

Method: The study employs subjective quality assessment using the Degradation Category Rating (DCR) method. It includes UHD output comparisons of HD VVC base layers with LCEVC enhancement and two baselines, across two bitrate configurations and 15 video sequences, rated by 25 participants.

Result: The study provides Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) with 95% confidence intervals for the tested configurations, enabling performance comparison between coding approaches and improvement due to LCEVC.

Conclusion: Using LCEVC as an enhancement layer on VVC improves subjective quality under certain conditions compared to baseline methods, with clear implications for multilayer video coding efficiency.

Abstract: This paper presents the results of a subjective quality assessment of a multilayer video coding configuration in which Low Complexity Enhancement Video Coding (LCEVC) is applied as an enhancement layer on top of a Versatile Video Coding (VVC) base layer. The evaluation follows the same test methodology and conditions previously defined for MPEG multilayer video coding assessments, with the LCEVC enhancement layer encoded using version 8.1 of the LCEVC Test Model (LTM). The test compares reconstructed UHD output generated from an HD VVC base layer with LCEVC enhancement against two reference cases: upsampled VVC base layer decoding and multilayer VVC (ML-VVC). Two operating points are considered, corresponding to enhancement layers representing approximately 10% and 50% of the total bitrate. Subjective assessment was conducted using the Degradation Category Rating (DCR) methodology with twenty five participants, across a dataset comprising fifteen SDR and HDR sequences. The reported results include Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) with associated 95% confidence intervals, enabling comparison of perceptual quality across coding approaches and operating points within the defined test scope.

*Ce Zheng,Shiyao Ma,Ke Zhang,Chen Sun,Wenqi Zhang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper proposes a metadata-driven federated learning framework to improve model performance and convergence, especially in realistic, non-IID scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FL simulations often use unrealistic data partitioning and fail to address data correlation among users, limiting performance in real-world deployments.

Method: A novel data partition model is developed using a homogeneous Poisson point process (HPPP). Additionally, a clustering-based user selection strategy leveraging metadata like user location is proposed.

Result: The framework enhances model performance, stability, and convergence in non-IID settings while being competitive under IID conditions. It performs particularly well when fewer users are selected per round.

Conclusion: The approach offers significant improvements for federated learning in realistic scenarios and provides guidance for future standardization in FL.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without sharing raw user data, but conventional simulations often rely on unrealistic data partitioning and current user selection methods ignore data correlation among users. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a metadatadriven FL framework. We first introduce a novel data partition model based on a homogeneous Poisson point process (HPPP), capturing both heterogeneity in data quantity and natural overlap among user datasets. Building on this model, we develop a clustering-based user selection strategy that leverages metadata, such as user location, to reduce data correlation and enhance label diversity across training rounds. Extensive experiments on FMNIST and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that the proposed framework improves model performance, stability, and convergence in non-IID scenarios, while maintaining comparable performance under IID settings. Furthermore, the method shows pronounced advantages when the number of selected users per round is small. These findings highlight the framework's potential for enhancing FL performance in realistic deployments and guiding future standardization.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a transfer learning framework to address uncalibrated hardware impairments in OFDM systems, ensuring better Carrier Frequency Offset (CFO) estimation across various software-defined radios (SDRs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CFO estimation in OFDM systems faces challenges due to hardware impairments in heterogeneous SDR platforms, and existing DNN methods lack device adaptability, restricting real-world deployment.

Method: The framework employs simulation-driven pretraining on synthetic OFDM signals with parametric distortions, followed by fine-tuning specific layers with a small amount of real data from each target device.

Result: The proposed method achieves a 30x BER (bit-error-rate) reduction compared to conventional methods across multiple SDR platforms under multipath conditions.

Conclusion: The framework effectively bridges simulation-to-reality gaps, offering an efficient and adaptable solution for CFO estimation in diverse wireless environments.

Abstract: Carrier Frequency Offset (CFO) estimation in Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) systems faces significant performance degradation across heterogeneous software-defined radio (SDR) platforms due to uncalibrated hardware impairments. Existing deep neural network (DNN)-based approaches lack device-level adaptation, limiting their practical deployment. This paper proposes a Sim2Real transfer learning framework for per-device CFO calibration, combining simulation-driven pretraining with lightweight receiver adaptation. A backbone DNN is pre-trained on synthetic OFDM signals incorporating parametric hardware distortions (e.g., phase noise, IQ imbalance), enabling generalized feature learning without costly cross-device data collection. Subsequently, only the regression layers are fine-tuned using $1,000$ real frames per target device, preserving hardware-agnostic knowledge while adapting to device-specific impairments. Experiments across three SDR families (USRP B210, USRP N210, HackRF One) achieve $30\times$ BER reduction compared to conventional CP-based methods under indoor multipath conditions. The framework bridges the simulation-to-reality gap for robust CFO estimation, enabling cost-effective deployment in heterogeneous wireless systems.

*Xi Zhong,Jörg Kliewer,Mingyue Ji*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: This paper introduces a straggler-aware framework for coded polynomial aggregation (CPA) and shows it achieves results with fewer worker responses by considering non-straggler patterns and their intersection structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve efficiency in distributed systems by reducing the required number of worker responses in polynomial aggregation, especially in straggler-aware scenarios.

Method: The paper extends CPA to account for specified non-straggler patterns, establishes necessary and sufficient recovery conditions, derives an intersection-size threshold, and offers explicit CPA scheme constructions for feasible cases.

Result: Exact recovery of weighted polynomial aggregation becomes achievable with fewer worker responses. The intersection-size threshold is proven key for feasibility, and a sharp feasibility transition is observed in simulations.

Conclusion: Straggler-aware CPA significantly reduces computational demands in distributed systems, with the paper offering theoretical guarantees and practical insights on feasibility thresholds.

Abstract: Coded polynomial aggregation (CPA) enables the master to directly recover a weighted aggregation of polynomial evaluations without individually decoding each term, thereby reducing the number of required worker responses. In this paper, we extend CPA to straggler-aware distributed computing systems and introduce a straggler-aware CPA framework with pre-specified non-straggler patterns, where exact recovery is required only for a given collection of admissible non-straggler sets. Our main result shows that exact recovery of the desired aggregation is achievable with fewer worker responses than required by polynomial coded computing based on individual decoding, and that feasibility is fundamentally characterized by the intersection structure of the non-straggler patterns. In particular, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for exact recovery in straggler-aware CPA and identify an intersection-size threshold that is sufficient to guarantee exact recovery. We further prove that this threshold becomes both necessary and sufficient when the number of admissible non-straggler sets is sufficiently large. We also provide an explicit construction of feasible CPA schemes whenever the intersection size exceeds the derived threshold. Finally, simulations reveal a sharp feasibility transition at the predicted threshold, providing empirical evidence that the bound is tight in practice.

TL;DR: The paper explores leveraging quantum communication in distributed storage systems to improve storage and repair bandwidth tradeoffs, showcasing advantages over classical systems and revealing new operational regimes enabled by quantum entanglement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in classical distributed storage systems regarding efficiency, this work explores the use of quantum communication to optimize the balance between storage and repair bandwidth.

Method: The authors propose a system where helper nodes transmit quantum information instead of classical bits, utilizing quantum channels. The repair process involves using quantum entanglement among surviving nodes and measurements on received quantum states.

Result: The paper characterizes the fundamental storage-repair bandwidth tradeoff and demonstrates improvements in quantum systems, particularly at the minimum-storage regenerating point. It identifies a unique operating point where both storage and repair bandwidth are minimized simultaneously when $d \geq 2k-2$.

Conclusion: Quantum communication enables new regimes in distributed storage systems, breaking the classical storage-bandwidth tradeoff and offering significant performance improvements through quantum entanglement.

Abstract: This work investigates the use of quantum resources in distributed storage systems. Consider an $(n,k,d)$ distributed storage system in which a file is stored across $n$ nodes such that any $k$ nodes suffice to reconstruct the file. When a node fails, any $d$ helper nodes transmit information to a newcomer to rebuild the system. In contrast to the classical repair, where helper nodes transmit classical bits, we allow them to send classical information over quantum channels to the newcomer. The newcomer then generates its storage by performing appropriate measurements on the received quantum states. In this setting, we fully characterize the fundamental tradeoff between storage and repair bandwidth (total communication cost). Compared to classical systems, the optimal storage--bandwidth tradeoff can be significantly improved with the enhancement of quantum entanglement shared only among the surviving nodes, particularly at the minimum-storage regenerating point. Remarkably, we show that when $d \geq 2k-2$, there exists an operating point at which \textit{both storage and repair bandwidth are simultaneously minimized}. This phenomenon breaks the tradeoff in the classical setting and reveals a fundamentally new regime enabled by quantum communication.

TL;DR: The paper combines scalar auxiliary variable methods with neural ODEs to create a stable, differentiable model for learning nonlinear dynamics, tested on synthetic string vibration data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of modeling nonlinear dynamics in physical systems by combining analytical approaches with modern machine learning techniques, enabling both stability and physical parameter accessibility.

Method: The authors combine scalar auxiliary variable techniques with neural ordinary differential equations, leveraging analytical solutions for linear system vibrations to ensure physical parameter accessibility without complex encoders.

Result: The proposed model successfully learns the nonlinear dynamics of a vibrating string from synthetic data, demonstrating its stability and effectiveness.

Conclusion: The research highlights a novel, differentiable approach to model nonlinear dynamics, blending analytical physical modeling and data-driven machine learning methods, offering stable solutions and direct parameter interpretability.

Abstract: Modal methods are a long-standing approach to physical modelling synthesis. Extensions to nonlinear problems are possible, including the case of a high-amplitude vibration of a string. A modal decomposition leads to a densely coupled nonlinear system of ordinary differential equations. Recent work in scalar auxiliary variable techniques has enabled construction of explicit and stable numerical solvers for such classes of nonlinear systems. On the other hand, machine learning approaches (in particular neural ordinary differential equations) have been successful in modelling nonlinear systems automatically from data. In this work, we examine how scalar auxiliary variable techniques can be combined with neural ordinary differential equations to yield a stable differentiable model capable of learning nonlinear dynamics. The proposed approach leverages the analytical solution for linear vibration of system's modes so that physical parameters of a system remain easily accessible after the training without the need for a parameter encoder in the model architecture. As a proof of concept, we generate synthetic data for the nonlinear transverse vibration of a string and show that the model can be trained to reproduce the nonlinear dynamics of the system. Sound examples are presented.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: SDP is an algorithm designed for efficient discovery of selective functional dependencies in databases, addressing computational and storage challenges effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address computational inefficiencies and oversized result sets caused by exhaustive functional dependency discovery methods in large-scale, high-dimensional relational databases.

Method: The authors propose the SDP (Selective-Discovery-and-Prune) algorithm, leveraging redundancy count to prioritize functional dependencies and pruning unproductive search paths using monotone upper bounds.

Result: SDP achieves faster computation and lower memory usage compared to exhaustive methods, as demonstrated through experiments on over 40 datasets.

Conclusion: SDP provides a scalable and memory-efficient approach to identifying significant functional dependencies, making it practical for large and complex database systems.

Abstract: Functional dependencies (FDs) are basic constraints in relational databases and are used for many data management tasks. Most FD discovery algorithms find all valid dependencies, but this causes two problems. First, the computational cost is prohibitive: computational complexity grows quadratically with the number of tuples and exponentially with the number of attributes, making discovery slow on large-scale and high-dimensional data. Second, the result set can be huge, making it hard to identify useful dependencies. We propose SDP (Selective-Discovery-and-Prune), which discovers the top-$k$ FDs ranked by redundancy count. Redundancy count measures how much duplicated information an FD explains and connects directly to storage overhead and update anomalies. SDP uses an upper bound on redundancy to prune the search space. It is proved that this upper bound is monotone: adding attributes refines partitions and thus decreases the bound. Once the bound falls below the top-$k$ threshold, the entire branch can be skipped. We improve SDP with three optimizations: ordering attributes by partition cardinality, using pairwise statistics in a Partition Cardinality Matrix to tighten bounds, and a global scheduler to explore promising branches first. Experiments on over 40 datasets show that SDP is much faster and uses less memory than exhaustive methods.

Motivation: The integration of IoT and edge computing faces critical privacy and security challenges in sensitive data settings such as healthcare.

Method: It proposes a new model utilizing fuzzy logic for adaptive decision-making, Zero-Knowledge Proofs for privacy, and blockchain smart contracts for secure access control.

Result: The framework enhances data privacy, secures access controls, and offers transparent audit trails, reducing unauthorized access.

Conclusion: The research significantly contributes to better-secured IoT systems and sets a foundation for future decentralized technology innovations in sensitive domains like healthcare.

Abstract: The rapid integration of IoT with edge computing has revolutionized various domains, particularly healthcare, by enabling real-time data sharing, remote monitoring, and decision-making. However, it introduces critical challenges, including data privacy breaches, security vulnerabilities, especially in environments dealing with sensitive information. Traditional access control mechanisms and centralized security systems do not address these issues, leaving IoT environments exposed to unauthorized access and data misuse. This research proposes Fuzzychain-edge, a novel Fuzzy logic-based adaptive Access control model for Blockchain in Edge Computing framework designed to overcome these limitations by incorporating Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), fuzzy logic, and smart contracts. ZKPs secure sensitive data during access control processes by enabling verification without revealing confidential details, thereby ensuring user privacy. Fuzzy logic facilitates adaptive, context-aware decision-making for access control by dynamically evaluating parameters such as data sensitivity, trust levels, and user roles. Blockchain technology, with its decentralized and immutable architecture, ensures transparency, traceability, and accountability using smart contracts that automate access control processes. The proposed framework addresses key challenges by enhancing security, reducing the likelihood of unauthorized access, and providing a transparent audit trail of data transactions. Expected outcomes include improved data privacy, accuracy in access control, and increased user trust in IoT systems. This research contributes significantly to advancing privacy-preserving, secure, and traceable solutions in IoT environments, laying the groundwork for future innovations in decentralized technologies and their applications in critical domains such as healthcare and beyond.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the uncharacterized security risks and potential attack surfaces introduced by AI agent skills due to implicit trust and minimal vetting.

Method: Conducted a large-scale empirical security analysis using 42,447 AI agent skills via SkillScan, a custom detection framework that integrates static analysis and LLM-based classification, and developed a vulnerability taxonomy.

Result: Found that 26.1% of skills contain vulnerabilities, including issues like data exfiltration (13.3%) and privilege escalation (11.8%). 5.2% exhibit high-severity patterns suggesting malicious intent. Skills with executable scripts are 2.12x more vulnerable than instruction-only skills.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the urgent need for robust permission systems and mandatory security vetting to protect against potential exploits in AI agent framework ecosystems.

Abstract: The rise of AI agent frameworks has introduced agent skills, modular packages containing instructions and executable code that dynamically extend agent capabilities. While this architecture enables powerful customization, skills execute with implicit trust and minimal vetting, creating a significant yet uncharacterized attack surface. We conduct the first large-scale empirical security analysis of this emerging ecosystem, collecting 42,447 skills from two major marketplaces and systematically analyzing 31,132 using SkillScan, a multi-stage detection framework integrating static analysis with LLM-based semantic classification. Our findings reveal pervasive security risks: 26.1% of skills contain at least one vulnerability, spanning 14 distinct patterns across four categories: prompt injection, data exfiltration, privilege escalation, and supply chain risks. Data exfiltration (13.3%) and privilege escalation (11.8%) are most prevalent, while 5.2% of skills exhibit high-severity patterns strongly suggesting malicious intent. We find that skills bundling executable scripts are 2.12x more likely to contain vulnerabilities than instruction-only skills (OR=2.12, p<0.001). Our contributions include: (1) a grounded vulnerability taxonomy derived from 8,126 vulnerable skills, (2) a validated detection methodology achieving 86.7% precision and 82.5% recall, and (3) an open dataset and detection toolkit to support future research. These results demonstrate an urgent need for capability-based permission systems and mandatory security vetting before this attack vector is further exploited.

Method: An evaluation of synthetic augmentation and substitution regimes using synthetic notes generated by a privacy-preserving method and transformer models with varying training mixtures.

Result: Synthetic augmentation reduced identifier leakage rates and improved model performance under epoch-scaled training, while synthetic substitution increased leakage.

Conclusion: Synthetic data augments training exposure and improves safety but cannot substitute real data for critical de-identification tasks.

Abstract: Veterinary electronic health records (vEHRs) contain privacy-sensitive identifiers that limit secondary use. While PetEVAL provides a benchmark for veterinary de-identification, the domain remains low-resource. This study evaluates whether large language model (LLM)-generated synthetic narratives improve de-identification safety under distinct training regimes, emphasizing (i) synthetic augmentation and (ii) fixed-budget substitution. We conducted a controlled simulation using a PetEVAL-derived corpus (3,750 holdout/1,249 train). We generated 10,382 synthetic notes using a privacy-preserving "template-only" regime where identifiers were removed prior to LLM prompting. Three transformer backbones (PetBERT, VetBERT, Bio_ClinicalBERT) were trained under varying mixtures. Evaluation prioritized document-level leakage rate (the fraction of documents with at least one missed identifier) as the primary safety outcome. Results show that under fixed-sample substitution, replacing real notes with synthetic ones monotonically increased leakage, indicating synthetic data cannot safely replace real supervision. Under compute-matched training, moderate synthetic mixing matched real-only performance, but high synthetic dominance degraded utility. Conversely, epoch-scaled augmentation improved performance: PetBERT span-overlap F1 increased from 0.831 to 0.850 +/- 0.014, and leakage decreased from 6.32% to 4.02% +/- 0.19%. However, these gains largely reflect increased training exposure rather than intrinsic synthetic data quality. Corpus diagnostics revealed systematic synthetic-real mismatches in note length and label distribution that align with persistent leakage. We conclude that synthetic augmentation is effective for expanding exposure but is complementary, not substitutive, for safety-critical veterinary de-identification.

### [348] [A Novel Contrastive Loss for Zero-Day Network Intrusion Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09902)
*Jack Wilkie,Hanan Hindy,Craig Michie,Christos Tachtatzis,James Irvine,Robert Atkinson*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of zero-day attacks in network intrusion detection by presenting a novel contrastive loss function that improves generalization to zero-day attacks while maintaining low false positive rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to solve the limitations of classical machine learning models in detecting zero-day attacks, which are not included in training data, and to improve upon the high false positive rates of anomaly-based detectors.

Method: The authors propose a novel contrastive loss function that learns from both benign traffic and known attack samples, enabling improved robustness in zero-day attack detection without relying solely on anomaly-based detection methods.

Result: The approach demonstrates significant performance improvements on the Lycos2017 dataset, achieving an AUROC improvement of .000065 for known attacks and .060883 for zero-day attacks. Additionally, it shows OpenAUC improvements of .170883 in open-set recognition compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively balances robustness to imbalanced data and generalization to zero-day attacks, offering a promising improvement in network intrusion detection systems.

Abstract: Machine learning has achieved state-of-the-art results in network intrusion detection; however, its performance significantly degrades when confronted by a new attack class -- a zero-day attack. In simple terms, classical machine learning-based approaches are adept at identifying attack classes on which they have been previously trained, but struggle with those not included in their training data. One approach to addressing this shortcoming is to utilise anomaly detectors which train exclusively on benign data with the goal of generalising to all attack classes -- both known and zero-day. However, this comes at the expense of a prohibitively high false positive rate. This work proposes a novel contrastive loss function which is able to maintain the advantages of other contrastive learning-based approaches (robustness to imbalanced data) but can also generalise to zero-day attacks. Unlike anomaly detectors, this model learns the distributions of benign traffic using both benign and known malign samples, i.e. other well-known attack classes (not including the zero-day class), and consequently, achieves significant performance improvements. The proposed approach is experimentally verified on the Lycos2017 dataset where it achieves an AUROC improvement of .000065 and .060883 over previous models in known and zero-day attack detection, respectively. Finally, the proposed method is extended to open-set recognition achieving OpenAUC improvements of .170883 over existing approaches.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A new method, FGSM DICNN, combining diluted convolutions and FGSM adversarial training, achieves 99.44% accuracy in Android malware classification, outperforming other techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to counter increasingly sophisticated Android malware and reduce reliance on large feature sets in classification motivated the study.

Method: The FGSM DICNN uses diluted convolutions for an expanded receptive field and FGSM perturbations in training for better accuracy with fewer features.

Result: The method achieved 99.44% classification accuracy, surpassing other existing models such as Custom Deep Neural Networks.

Conclusion: The FGSM DICNN model is an efficient and computationally effective approach to Android malware classification with high accuracy.

Abstract: Android malware has become an increasingly critical threat to organizations, society and individuals, posing significant risks to privacy, data security and infrastructure. As malware continues to evolve in terms of complexity and sophistication, the mitigation and detection of these malicious software instances have become more time consuming and challenging particularly due to the requirement of large number of features to identify potential malware. To address these challenges, this research proposes Fast Gradient Sign Method with Diluted Convolutional Neural Network (FGSM DICNN) method for malware classification. DICNN contains diluted convolutions which increases receptive field, enabling the model to capture dispersed malware patterns across long ranges using fewer features without adding parameters. Additionally, the FGSM strategy enhance the accuracy by using one-step perturbations during training that provides more defensive advantage of lower computational cost. This integration helps to manage high classification accuracy while reducing the dependence on extensive feature sets. The proposed FGSM DICNN model attains 99.44% accuracy while outperforming other existing approaches such as Custom Deep Neural Network (DCNN).

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper examines privacy and security challenges in using large language models (LLMs) for healthcare settings, identifies vulnerabilities, and evaluates existing privacy-preserving techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the privacy and security issues arising from integrating LLMs in healthcare, which involve sensitive clinical data and high-stakes medical workflows.

Method: The authors systematically analyze threats in three LLM phases: Data preprocessing, Fine-tuning, and Inference. They develop a threat model, characterize vulnerabilities, and assess existing privacy-preserving techniques.

Result: The analysis reveals persistent limitations in ensuring privacy of clinical data despite existing techniques, especially across diverse healthcare deployment environments.

Conclusion: The paper highlights phase-aware recommendations and future research directions to make LLMs more secure and trustworthy in healthcare settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in healthcare to support clinical decision-making, summarize electronic health records (EHRs), and enhance patient care. However, this integration introduces significant privacy and security challenges, driven by the sensitivity of clinical data and the high-stakes nature of medical workflows. These risks become even more pronounced across heterogeneous deployment environments, ranging from small on-premise hospital systems to regional health networks, each with unique resource limitations and regulatory demands. This Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) examines the evolving threat landscape across the three core LLM phases: Data preprocessing, Fine-tuning, and Inference within realistic healthcare settings. We present a detailed threat model that characterizes adversaries, capabilities, and attack surfaces at each phase, and we systematize how existing privacy-preserving techniques (PPTs) attempt to mitigate these vulnerabilities. While existing defenses show promise, our analysis identifies persistent limitations in securing sensitive clinical data across diverse operational tiers. We conclude with phase-aware recommendations and future research directions aimed at strengthening privacy guarantees for LLMs in regulated environments. This work provides a foundation for understanding the intersection of LLMs, threats, and privacy in healthcare, offering a roadmap toward more robust and clinically trustworthy AI systems.

TL;DR: Large Language Models are vulnerable to indirect prompt injection attacks. ReasAlign enhances safety alignment by employing structured reasoning steps and test-time scaling mechanisms, significantly outperforming existing defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the susceptibility of agentic systems powered by LLMs to indirect prompt injection attacks, which compromise their intended behavior and security.

Method: ReasAlign uses structured reasoning steps to analyze user inputs, detect conflicts, and ensure the proper execution of tasks. A preference-optimized judge model is applied for scoring reasoning steps and selecting optimal trajectories.

Result: ReasAlign significantly outperforms prior methods like Meta SecAlign, achieving higher utility (94.6%) and lower attack success rates (3.6%) on benchmarks.

Conclusion: ReasAlign provides an effective model-level defense against indirect prompt injection attacks, achieving an optimal balance of security and utility for real-world applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled the development of powerful agentic systems capable of automating complex workflows across various fields. However, these systems are highly vulnerable to indirect prompt injection attacks, where malicious instructions embedded in external data can hijack agent behavior. In this work, we present ReasAlign, a model-level solution to improve safety alignment against indirect prompt injection attacks. The core idea of ReasAlign is to incorporate structured reasoning steps to analyze user queries, detect conflicting instructions, and preserve the continuity of the user's intended tasks to defend against indirect injection attacks. To further ensure reasoning logic and accuracy, we introduce a test-time scaling mechanism with a preference-optimized judge model that scores reasoning steps and selects the best trajectory. Comprehensive evaluations across various benchmarks show that ReasAlign maintains utility comparable to an undefended model while consistently outperforming Meta SecAlign, the strongest prior guardrail. On the representative open-ended CyberSecEval2 benchmark, which includes multiple prompt-injected tasks, ReasAlign achieves 94.6% utility and only 3.6% ASR, far surpassing the state-of-the-art defensive model of Meta SecAlign (56.4% utility and 74.4% ASR). These results demonstrate that ReasAlign achieves the best trade-off between security and utility, establishing a robust and practical defense against prompt injection attacks in real-world agentic systems.

*Nadya Abaev,Denis Klimov,Gerard Levinov,David Mimran,Yuval Elovici,Asaf Shabtai*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper presents AgentGuardian, a security framework that ensures safe and authorized operations of AI agents, adapting to context and governing inputs effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI agents are widely used for automation and decision-making, but there is a pressing need to ensure they perform only authorized actions and handle inputs securely to prevent misuse and maintain system integrity.

Method: The authors developed AgentGuardian, a framework that learns legitimate agent behaviors during a controlled staging phase, then enforces dynamic, context-aware access-control policies based on execution traces and control flow dependencies.

Result: AgentGuardian was tested on two real-world applications and successfully detected malicious inputs, preserved normal agent functions, and mitigated errors driven by hallucinations or orchestration-level issues.

Conclusion: AgentGuardian demonstrates its effectiveness in enhancing AI agent security without hindering their functional performance, offering a robust solution to counter malicious behavior and operational mistakes.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) agents are increasingly used in a variety of domains to automate tasks, interact with users, and make decisions based on data inputs. Ensuring that AI agents perform only authorized actions and handle inputs appropriately is essential for maintaining system integrity and preventing misuse. In this study, we introduce the AgentGuardian, a novel security framework that governs and protects AI agent operations by enforcing context-aware access-control policies. During a controlled staging phase, the framework monitors execution traces to learn legitimate agent behaviors and input patterns. From this phase, it derives adaptive policies that regulate tool calls made by the agent, guided by both real-time input context and the control flow dependencies of multi-step agent actions. Evaluation across two real-world AI agent applications demonstrates that AgentGuardian effectively detects malicious or misleading inputs while preserving normal agent functionality. Moreover, its control-flow-based governance mechanism mitigates hallucination-driven errors and other orchestration-level malfunctions.

### [353] [Be Your Own Red Teamer: Safety Alignment via Self-Play and Reflective Experience Replay](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10589)
*Hao Wang,Yanting Wang,Hao Li,Rui Li,Lei Sha*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a self-evolving defense system using large language models to detect and address adversarial jailbreak attacks autonomously.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety measures for large language models lack flexibility and fail to address novel and sophisticated adversarial threats effectively.

Method: A Safety Self-Play (SSP) system, combining attack and defense roles within a single LLM using Reinforcement Learning, alongside Reflective Experience Replay to optimize learning from failure cases.

Result: The SSP approach showcases superior robustness and adaptability compared to static adversarial dataset-based baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed SSP system significantly enhances proactive safety alignment, setting a new standard for defending against adversarial threats.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable capabilities but remain vulnerable to adversarial ``jailbreak'' attacks designed to bypass safety guardrails. Current safety alignment methods depend heavily on static external red teaming, utilizing fixed defense prompts or pre-collected adversarial datasets. This leads to a rigid defense that overfits known patterns and fails to generalize to novel, sophisticated threats. To address this critical limitation, we propose empowering the model to be its own red teamer, capable of achieving autonomous and evolving adversarial attacks. Specifically, we introduce Safety Self- Play (SSP), a system that utilizes a single LLM to act concurrently as both the Attacker (generating jailbreaks) and the Defender (refusing harmful requests) within a unified Reinforcement Learning (RL) loop, dynamically evolving attack strategies to uncover vulnerabilities while simultaneously strengthening defense mechanisms. To ensure the Defender effectively addresses critical safety issues during the self-play, we introduce an advanced Reflective Experience Replay Mechanism, which uses an experience pool accumulated throughout the process. The mechanism employs a Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) sampling strategy to focus on failure cases with low rewards, helping the model learn from past hard mistakes while balancing exploration and exploitation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our SSP approach autonomously evolves robust defense capabilities, significantly outperforming baselines trained on static adversarial datasets and establishing a new benchmark for proactive safety alignment.

TL;DR: PADER is a Paillier-based secure decentralized social recommendation system ensuring privacy by avoiding centralized platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing privacy concerns due to centralized platforms collecting extensive user and seller data.

Method: Proposes PADER, which uses Paillier cryptosystem and decentralized network for secure social recommendation, with protocols for efficient arithmetic circuit computations.

Result: The system achieves practical efficiency with training ~500K ratings per epoch in under 3 hours and iteratively processing hundreds of ratings in about one second.

Conclusion: PADER provides a practical solution for secure and private decentralized recommendation systems, demonstrated by its efficiency in handling large-scale data.

Abstract: The prevalence of recommendation systems also brings privacy concerns to both the users and the sellers, as centralized platforms collect as much data as possible from them. To keep the data private, we propose PADER: a Paillier-based secure decentralized social recommendation system. In this system, the users and the sellers are nodes in a decentralized network. The training and inference of the recommendation model are carried out securely in a decentralized manner, without the involvement of a centralized platform. To this end, we apply the Paillier cryptosystem to the SoReg (Social Regularization) model, which exploits both user's ratings and social relations. We view the SoReg model as a two-party secure polynomial evaluation problem and observe that the simple bipartite computation may result in poor efficiency. To improve efficiency, we design secure addition and multiplication protocols to support secure computation on any arithmetic circuit, along with an optimal data packing scheme that is suitable for the polynomial computations of real values. Experiment results show that our method only takes about one second to iterate through one user with hundreds of ratings, and training with ~500K ratings for one epoch only takes <3 hours, which shows that the method is practical in real applications.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Python package 'causalfe' for estimating treatment effects in panel data using Causal Forests with Fixed Effects (CFFE).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional causal forest methods face challenges in panel data due to spurious heterogeneity from unit and time fixed effects. This motivated the development of the CFFE approach.

Method: The CFFE method uses node-level residualization to account for fixed effects during tree construction instead of removing them globally.

Result: Simulation studies validate the effectiveness of the CFFE estimator under multiple data generating scenarios.

Conclusion: The 'causalfe' package facilitates precise estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects in panel data, advancing causal inference tools.

Abstract: The causalfe package provides a Python implementation of Causal Forests with Fixed Effects (CFFE) for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects in panel data settings. Standard causal forest methods struggle with panel data because unit and time fixed effects induce spurious heterogeneity in treatment effect estimates. The CFFE approach addresses this by performing node-level residualization during tree construction, removing fixed effects within each candidate split rather than globally. This paper describes the methodology, documents the software interface, and demonstrates the package through simulation studies that validate the estimator's performance under various data generating processes.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the training dynamics of shallow quadratic-activation neural networks in high-dimensional setups under proportional scaling, highlighting overparameterization effects, label noise, and generalization behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand the dynamics of overparameterized neural networks with quadratic activation in the teacher-student setup to analyze learning behaviors under high-dimensional scaling.

Method: Dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) is used to derive gradient flow equations, enabling the study of the performance and spectral properties under l2-regularization in high-dimensional regimes.

Result: It reveals a double descent phenomenon under label noise and derives a perfect recovery threshold in the small regularization limit, characterizing the impact of overparameterization.

Conclusion: The study provides quantitative insights into how overparameterization affects learning, generalization, and recovery thresholds in neural networks.

Abstract: We study the high-dimensional training dynamics of a shallow neural network with quadratic activation in a teacher-student setup. We focus on the extensive-width regime, where the teacher and student network widths scale proportionally with the input dimension, and the sample size grows quadratically. This scaling aims to describe overparameterized neural networks in which feature learning still plays a central role. In the high-dimensional limit, we derive a dynamical characterization of the gradient flow, in the spirit of dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). Under l2-regularization, we analyze these equations at long times and characterize the performance and spectral properties of the resulting estimator. This result provides a quantitative understanding of the effect of overparameterization on learning and generalization, and reveals a double descent phenomenon in the presence of label noise, where generalization improves beyond interpolation. In the small regularization limit, we obtain an exact expression for the perfect recovery threshold as a function of the network widths, providing a precise characterization of how overparameterization influences recovery.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-agent systems suffer from high latency and computation due to spatio-temporal interaction paradigms, thus requiring a more efficient and flexible communication approach.

Method: TopoDIM is a novel one-shot topology generation framework that uses diverse interaction modes to enable decentralized, non-iterative, and heterogeneous communication among agents. This approach maintains privacy, increases adaptability, and enhances token efficiency.

Result: TopoDIM improves the efficiency of LLM-based multi-agent systems by reducing token consumption by 46.41% while also improving average task performance by 1.50% compared to state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: TopoDIM delivers a more efficient and effective way to structure communication within multi-agent systems, significantly reducing computational overhead, enhancing performance, and promoting adaptability in diverse environments.

Abstract: Optimizing communication topology in LLM-based multi-agent system is critical for enabling collective intelligence. Existing methods mainly rely on spatio-temporal interaction paradigms, where the sequential execution of multi-round dialogues incurs high latency and computation. Motivated by the recent insights that evaluation and debate mechanisms can improve problem-solving in multi-agent systems, we propose TopoDIM, a framework for one-shot Topology generation with Diverse Interaction Modes. Designed for decentralized execution to enhance adaptability and privacy, TopoDIM enables agents to autonomously construct heterogeneous communication without iterative coordination, achieving token efficiency and improved task performance. Experiments demonstrate that TopoDIM reduces total token consumption by 46.41% while improving average performance by 1.50% over state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the framework exhibits strong adaptability in organizing communication among heterogeneous agents. Code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/TopoDIM-8D35/

TL;DR: The paper introduces Latency-Aware Multi-agent System (LAMaS), a framework optimized for reducing latency in parallel execution of multi-agent systems while maintaining task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address high inference latency in Multi-agent Systems under parallel execution, which limits their scalability and application in time-sensitive scenarios.

Method: The authors propose a latency-aware orchestration framework (LAMaS) that explicitly optimizes execution topology graphs to reduce critical path length during parallel execution.

Result: LAMaS achieves a 38-46% reduction in critical path length compared to existing methods, while maintaining or improving task performance across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: Optimizing latency under parallel execution is crucial for designing efficient multi-agent systems, and LAMaS demonstrates significant advancements in this area.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) enable complex reasoning by coordinating multiple agents, but often incur high inference latency due to multi-step execution and repeated model invocations, severely limiting their scalability and usability in time-sensitive scenarios. Most existing approaches primarily optimize task performance and inference cost, and explicitly or implicitly assume sequential execution, making them less optimal for controlling latency under parallel execution. In this work, we investigate learning-based orchestration of multi-agent systems with explicit latency supervision under parallel execution. We propose Latency-Aware Multi-agent System (LAMaS), a latency-aware multi-agent orchestration framework that enables parallel execution and explicitly optimizes the critical execution path, allowing the controller to construct execution topology graphs with lower latency under parallel execution. Our experiments show that our approach reduces critical path length by 38-46% compared to the state-of-the-art baseline for multi-agent architecture search across multiple benchmarks, while maintaining or even improving task performance. These results highlight the importance of explicitly optimizing latency under parallel execution when designing efficient multi-agent systems.

*Joshua Caiata,Carter Blair,Kate Larson*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: Fairness in multi-agent scenarios isn't only about outcomes but also processes. The study introduces 'procedural fairness,' ensuring equal decision-making powers among agents and explores its implications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fairness notions in multi-agent frameworks often focus on outcomes, neglecting the importance of decision-making processes, as suggested by psychological, economic, and theoretical evidence.

Method: A novel fairness objective called 'procedural fairness' is formulated, focusing on equal representation and decision-making power alongside ensuring proportional outcomes.

Result: Empirical data shows that focusing on procedural fairness leads to minimal sacrifice in outcome-based fairness measures while ensuring representation and voice in decisions.

Conclusion: Fairness involves normative choices, and procedural fairness should receive greater emphasis in fairness frameworks to balance outcomes and representation, highlighting its practical framework.

Abstract: In the context of multi-agent multi-armed bandits (MA-MAB), fairness is often reduced to outcomes: maximizing welfare, reducing inequality, or balancing utilities. However, evidence in psychology, economics, and Rawlsian theory suggests that fairness is also about process and who gets a say in the decisions being made. We introduce a new fairness objective, procedural fairness, which provides equal decision-making power for all agents, lies in the core, and provides for proportionality in outcomes. Empirical results confirm that fairness notions based on optimizing for outcomes sacrifice equal voice and representation, while the sacrifice in outcome-based fairness objectives (like equality and utilitarianism) is minimal under procedurally fair policies. We further prove that different fairness notions prioritize fundamentally different and incompatible values, highlighting that fairness requires explicit normative choices. This paper argues that procedural legitimacy deserves greater focus as a fairness objective, and provides a framework for putting procedural fairness into practice.

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: The paper focuses on the DNF model counting problem, which is important for applications like probabilistic databases and network reliability. It introduces a new Monte Carlo algorithm with adaptive stopping and short-circuit evaluations, proving its PAC learning bounds and greater efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate and efficient DNF model counting is critical for applications such as probabilistic inference and network reliability, but computational intractability limits existing methods. The paper aims to improve efficiency and scalability in this domain.

Method: A new Monte Carlo approach is developed, featuring adaptive stopping rules alongside short-circuit formula evaluation, ensuring PAC-learning bounds and asymptotic efficiency.

Result: The proposed algorithm achieves significantly better performance than existing methods, scaling to much larger problems with millions of variables and outperforming prior approaches by orders of magnitude in experiments.

Conclusion: The new method offers a more efficient and scalable solution for DNF model counting, demonstrating significant experimental improvements and theoretical soundness.

Abstract: Model counting of Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) formulas is a critical problem in applications such as probabilistic inference and network reliability. For example, it is often used for query evaluation in probabilistic databases. Due to the computational intractability of exact DNF counting, there has been a line of research into a variety of approximation algorithms. These include Monte Carlo approaches such as the classical algorithms of Karp, Luby, and Madras (1989), as well as methods based on hashing (Soos et al. 2023), and heuristic approximations based on Neural Nets (Abboud, Ceylan, and Lukasiewicz 2020).
  We develop a new Monte Carlo approach with an adaptive stopping rule and short-circuit formula evaluation. We prove it achieves Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning bounds and is asymptotically more efficient than the previous methods. We also show experimentally that it out-performs prior algorithms by orders of magnitude, and can scale to much larger problems with millions of variables.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations of large language models (LLMs) that struggle with differentiating organizations and handling monetary amounts in financial contexts.

Method: Meta's Llama 3 8B is fine-tuned for financial NER using instruction tuning paired with LoRA, converting annotated sentences into instruction triples for efficient learning.

Result: The method achieves a micro-F1 score of 0.894 against competitive benchmarks like Qwen3-8B, Baichuan2-7B, T5, and BERT-Base.

Conclusion: Instruction tuning combined with LoRA enables state-of-the-art performance in domain-sensitive NER tasks, offering insights into hyperparameters, data specifics, and visualizations.

Abstract: Particularly, financial named-entity recognition (NER) is one of the many important approaches to translate unformatted reports and news into structured knowledge graphs. However, free, easy-to-use large language models (LLMs) often fail to differentiate organisations as people, or disregard an actual monetary amount entirely. This paper takes Meta's Llama 3 8B and applies it to financial NER by combining instruction fine-tuning and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Each annotated sentence is converted into an instruction-input-output triple, enabling the model to learn task descriptions while fine-tuning with small low-rank matrices instead of updating all weights. Using a corpus of 1,693 sentences, our method obtains a micro-F1 score of 0.894 compared with Qwen3-8B, Baichuan2-7B, T5, and BERT-Base. We present dataset statistics, describe training hyperparameters, and perform visualizations of entity density, learning curves, and evaluation metrics. Our results show that instruction tuning combined with parameter-efficient fine-tuning enables state-of-the-art performance on domain-sensitive NER.

### [363] [Tables or Sankey Diagrams? Investigating User Interaction with Different Representations of Simulation Parameters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10232)
*Choro Ulan uulu,Mikhail Kulyabin,Katharina M Zeiner,Jan Joosten,Nuno Miguel Martins Pacheco,Filippos Petridis,Rebecca Johnson,Jan Bosch,Helena Holmström Olsson*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper investigates how interactive Sankey diagrams outperform tabular interfaces in visualizing parameter dependencies, reducing cognitive load and improving workflow efficiency in configuration-intensive software systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges faced in comprehending complex parameter dependencies using traditional tabular interfaces which lead to errors, inefficiencies, and reduced trust in configuration-intensive software systems.

Method: A heuristic evaluation, employing the PURE method, was conducted with three expert evaluators to compare a Sankey diagram prototype against traditional tabular interfaces regarding their effectiveness in solving core engineering tasks.

Result: The study showed that Sankey diagrams reduced cognitive load by 51% and interaction complexity by 56%. Additionally, parameter dependencies were immediately visible rather than requiring mental reconstruction by users.

Conclusion: Flow-based visualizations, such as Sankey diagrams, enhance the comprehension of parameter dependencies, thus resolving critical program comprehension challenges in various domains where understanding complex system configurations is essential.

Abstract: Understanding complex parameter dependencies is critical for effective configuration and maintenance of software systems across diverse domains - from Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE) to cloud infrastructure and database management. However, legacy tabular interfaces create a major bottleneck: engineers cannot easily comprehend how parameters relate across the system, leading to inefficient workflows, costly configuration errors, and reduced system trust - a fundamental program comprehension challenge in configuration-intensive software. This research evaluates whether interactive Sankey diagrams can improve comprehension of parameter dependencies compared to traditional spreadsheet interfaces. We employed a heuristic evaluation using the PURE method with three expert evaluators (UX design, simulation, and software development specialists) to compare a Sankey-based prototype to traditional tabular representations for core engineering tasks. Our key contribution demonstrates that flow-based parameter visualizations significantly reduce cognitive load (51% lower PURE scores) and interaction complexity (56% fewer steps) compared to traditional tables, while making parameter dependencies immediately visible rather than requiring mental reconstruction. By explicitly visualizing parameter relationships, Sankey diagrams address a core software visualization challenge: helping users comprehend complex system configurations without requiring deep tool-specific knowledge. While demonstrated through CAE software, this research contributes to program comprehension and software visualization by showing that dependency-aware visualizations can significantly improve understanding of configuration-intensive systems. The findings have implications for any software domain where comprehending complex parameter relationships is essential for effective system use and maintenance.

### [364] [Developer Interaction Patterns with Proactive AI: A Five-Day Field Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10253)
*Nadine Kuo,Agnia Sergeyuk,Valerie Chen,Maliheh Izadi*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper investigates when developers are most receptive to proactive AI coding assistance within their workflows, revealing patterns of engagement and cognitive benefits from well-timed suggestions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore when and how developers are receptive to proactive AI assistance, addressing the gap in understanding human-AI interaction during software development without manual invocation.

Method: A five-day field study with 15 developers interacting with a production-grade IDE's AI assistant that provided proactive code quality suggestions. The study analyzed 229 AI interventions across 5,732 interactions.

Result: Proactive AI interventions timed at workflow boundaries had higher engagement (52%), while interventions mid-task saw higher dismissal rates (62%). Well-timed suggestions required less interpretation time compared to reactive ones, enhancing cognitive alignment.

Conclusion: Proactive AI coding tools improve engagement and cognitive alignment when integrating well-timed interventions into developer workflows. These insights offer practical design strategies for future proactive AI tools in coding environments.

Abstract: Current in-IDE AI coding tools typically rely on time-consuming manual prompting and context management, whereas proactive alternatives that anticipate developer needs without explicit invocation remain underexplored. Understanding when humans are receptive to such proactive AI assistance during their daily work remains an open question in human-AI interaction research. We address this gap through a field study of proactive AI assistance in professional developer workflows. We present a five-day in-the-wild study with 15 developers who interacted with a proactive feature of an AI assistant integrated into a production-grade IDE that offers code quality suggestions based on in-IDE developer activity. We examined 229 AI interventions across 5,732 interaction points to understand how proactive suggestions are received across workflow stages, how developers experience them, and their perceived impact. Our findings reveal systematic patterns in human receptivity to proactive suggestions: interventions at workflow boundaries (e.g., post-commit) achieved 52% engagement rates, while mid-task interventions (e.g., on declined edit) were dismissed 62% of the time. Notably, well-timed proactive suggestions required significantly less interpretation time than reactive suggestions (45.4s versus 101.4s, W = 109.00, r = 0.533, p = 0.0016), indicating enhanced cognitive alignment. This study provides actionable implications for designing proactive coding assistants, including how to time interventions, align them with developer context, and strike a balance between AI agency and user control in production IDEs.

### [365] [An Extension-Based Accessibility Framework for Making Blockly Accessible to Blind and Low-Vision Users](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10688)
*Rubel Hassan Mollik,Vamsi Krishna Kosuri,Hans Djalali,Stephanie Ludi,Aboubakar Mountapmbeme*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework called EAF to make block-based programming environments accessible for blind or visually impaired (BVI) students, emphasizing modular integration and compatibility with existing tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing BBPEs like Scratch and Code.org are mostly inaccessible to BVI learners due to reliance on modifications to the Blockly library, which limits adoption of accessibility solutions.

Method: The authors introduce the Extension-based Accessibility Framework (EAF), which uses a modular design for seamless integration. It includes a 3D hierarchical navigation model, mode-based editing, and WAI-ARIA implementation for screen reader compatibility.

Result: The EAF framework was integrated into two BBPEs and tested across 177 scenarios. Semi-structured interviews with four participants (using screen readers) highlighted improved spatial orientation and mental model formation.

Conclusion: EAF demonstrates that a modular architecture can enhance accessibility for BVI learners while maintaining compatibility with existing block-based programming environments.

Abstract: Block-based programming environments (BBPEs) such as Scratch and Code.org are now widely used in K-12 computer science classes, but they remain mostly inaccessible to blind or visually impaired (BVI) learners. A major problem is that prior accessibility solutions have relied on modifications to the Blockly library, making them difficult to apply in existing BBPEs and thereby limiting adoption. We present an Extension-based Accessibility Framework (EAF) to make BBPEs accessible for BVI students. The framework uses a modular architecture that enables seamless integration with existing Blockly-based BBPEs. We present an innovative three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical navigation model featuring stack labeling and block numbering, mode-based editing to prevent accidental modifications, and WAI-ARIA implementation to ensure compatibility with external screen readers. We evaluated our approach by integrating the EAF framework into two BBPEs (covering 177 test cases) and conducting semi-structured interviews with four participants using VoiceOver, JAWS, and NVDA. Participants reported clearer spatial orientation and easier mental model formation compared to default Blockly keyboard navigation. EAF shows that modular architecture can provide comprehensive accessibility while ensuring compatibility with existing BBPEs.

### [366] [The Algorithmic Gaze: An Audit and Ethnography of the LAION-Aesthetics Predictor Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09896)
*Jordan Taylor,William Agnew,Maarten Sap,Sarah E. Fox,Haiyi Zhu*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper investigates the biases of the LAION Aesthetic Predictor (LAP), finding that its aesthetic measures favor certain cultural and gendered standards, potentially reinforcing harmful representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To critically examine the biases in aesthetic evaluation models (like LAP) used in training generative AI models, and to explore their implications on representation and fairness.

Method: Conducted audits across three datasets to analyze LAP's filtering effects, scored two art datasets to observe aesthetic preferences, and performed digital ethnography on LAP's creation process.

Result: LAP disproportionately favors captions mentioning women while filtering out mentions of men or LGBTQ+ people, and prioritizes western and Japanese realistic art styles. Biases in LAP stem from its training dataset, sourced largely from English-speaking photographers and western AI-enthusiasts.

Conclusion: Aesthetic evaluation models like LAP encode cultural and gender biases, and the authors encourage a move toward pluralistic and inclusive approaches for assessing aesthetics in AI development.

Abstract: Visual generative AI models are trained using a one-size-fits-all measure of aesthetic appeal. However, what is deemed "aesthetic" is inextricably linked to personal taste and cultural values, raising the question of whose taste is represented in visual generative AI models. In this work, we study an aesthetic evaluation model--LAION Aesthetic Predictor (LAP)--that is widely used to curate datasets to train visual generative image models, like Stable Diffusion, and evaluate the quality of AI-generated images. To understand what LAP measures, we audited the model across three datasets. First, we examined the impact of aesthetic filtering on the LAION-Aesthetics Dataset (approximately 1.2B images), which was curated from LAION-5B using LAP. We find that the LAP disproportionally filters in images with captions mentioning women, while filtering out images with captions mentioning men or LGBTQ+ people. Then, we used LAP to score approximately 330k images across two art datasets, finding the model rates realistic images of landscapes, cityscapes, and portraits from western and Japanese artists most highly. In doing so, the algorithmic gaze of this aesthetic evaluation model reinforces the imperial and male gazes found within western art history. In order to understand where these biases may have originated, we performed a digital ethnography of public materials related to the creation of LAP. We find that the development of LAP reflects the biases we found in our audits, such as the aesthetic scores used to train LAP primarily coming from English-speaking photographers and western AI-enthusiasts. In response, we discuss how aesthetic evaluation can perpetuate representational harms and call on AI developers to shift away from prescriptive measures of "aesthetics" toward more pluralistic evaluation.

### [367] [LangLasso: Interactive Cluster Descriptions through LLM Explanation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10458)
*Raphael Buchmüller,Dennis Collaris,Linhao Meng,Angelos Chatzimparmpas*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: LangLasso utilizes large language models to produce natural language descriptions of data clusters, enabling intuitive interpretation without technical expertise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap in making cluster data interpretation accessible to non-experts while integrating contextual knowledge beyond standard visualization methods.

Method: Developed LangLasso, a system leveraging large language models to generate natural language explanations of clusters for easier understanding and interpretation.

Result: LangLasso reliably provides human-readable cluster descriptions, making insights comprehensible to non-technical users and incorporating external knowledge effectively.

Conclusion: LangLasso enhances cluster interpretation accessibility, supports broader audiences, and complements traditional visual analytics approaches effectively.

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction is a powerful technique for revealing structure and potential clusters in data. However, as the axes are complex, non-linear combinations of features, they often lack semantic interpretability. Existing visual analytics (VA) methods support cluster interpretation through feature comparison and interactive exploration, but they require technical expertise and intense human effort. We present \textit{LangLasso}, a novel method that complements VA approaches through interactive, natural language descriptions of clusters using large language models (LLMs). It produces human-readable descriptions that make cluster interpretation accessible to non-experts and allow integration of external contextual knowledge beyond the dataset. We systematically evaluate the reliability of these explanations and demonstrate that \langlasso provides an effective first step for engaging broader audiences in cluster interpretation.

### [368] [Empowering Older Adults in Digital Technology Use with Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10018)
*Hasti Sharifi,Homaira Huda Shomee,Sourav Medya,Debaleena Chattopadhyay*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper studies communication challenges older adults face with tech support and demonstrates that AI can improve comprehension and solution accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Older adults face difficulties in articulating technology-related queries due to cognitive and language barriers.

Method: The study used diary input from older adults, thematic analysis, AI-rephrased queries using GPT-4, and created the OATS dataset.

Result: AI-rephrased queries improved solution accuracy and comprehension for both older and younger adults. The OATS dataset was validated successfully.

Conclusion: Foundation models can address communication barriers, enhancing tech support for older adults and paving the way for equitable AI systems.

Abstract: While high-quality technology support can assist older adults in using digital applications, many struggle to articulate their issues due to unfamiliarity with technical terminology and age-related cognitive changes. This study examines these communication challenges and explores AI-based approaches to mitigate them. We conducted a diary study with English-speaking, community-dwelling older adults to collect asynchronous, technology-related queries and used reflexive thematic analysis to identify communication barriers. To address these barriers, we evaluated how foundation models can paraphrase older adults' queries to improve solution accuracy. Two controlled experiments followed: one with younger adults evaluating AI-rephrased queries and another with older adults evaluating AI-generated solutions. We also developed a pipeline using large language models to generate the first synthetic dataset of how older adults request tech support (OATS). We identified four key communication challenges: verbosity, incompleteness, over-specification, and under-specification. Our prompt-chaining approach using the large language model, GPT-4o, elicited contextual details, paraphrased the original query, and generated a solution. AI-rephrased queries significantly improved solution accuracy (69% vs. 46%) and Google search results (69% vs. 35%). Younger adults better understood AI-rephrased queries (93.7% vs. 65.8%) and reported greater confidence and ease. Older adults reported high perceived ability to answer contextual questions (89.8%) and follow solutions (94.7%), with high confidence and ease. OATS demonstrated strong fidelity and face validity. This work shows how foundation models can enhance technology support for older adults by addressing age-related communication barriers. The OATS dataset offers a scalable resource for developing equitable AI systems that better serve aging populations.

### [370] [Who Owns the Text? Design Patterns for Preserving Authorship in AI-Assisted Writing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10236)
*Bohan Zhang,Chengke Bu,Paramveer S. Dhillon*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: AI writing assistants reduce cognitive load and maintain text quality, but can weaken psychological ownership among users. Style personalization partially mitigates this effect.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand the tension between improving fluency and reducing effort through AI while maintaining authors' psychological ownership of their writing.

Method: An online study with 176 participants completing three writing tasks: unassisted email, AI-assisted proposal, and persona-coached cover letter, with half receiving prior style personalization.

Result: AI assistance reduced cognitive load but decreased psychological ownership. Persona coaching did not improve ownership, while style personalization partially restored it and increased text incorporation.

Conclusion: AI tools can enhance writing efficiency but risk undermining authorship. Design patterns like style personalization can balance ownership and AI integration in writing tools.

Abstract: AI writing assistants can reduce effort and improve fluency, but they may also weaken writers' sense of authorship. We study this tension with an ownership-aware co-writing editor that offers on-demand, sentence-level suggestions and tests two common design choices: persona-based coaching and style personalization. In an online study (N=176), participants completed three professional writing tasks: an email without AI help, a proposal with generic AI suggestions, and a cover letter with persona-based coaching, while half received suggestions tailored to a brief sample of their prior writing. Across the two AI-assisted tasks, psychological ownership dropped relative to unassisted writing (about 0.85-1.0 points on a 7-point scale), even as cognitive load decreased (about 0.9 points) and quality ratings stayed broadly similar overall. Persona coaching did not prevent the ownership decline. Style personalization partially restored ownership (about +0.43) and increased AI incorporation in text (+5 percentage points). We distill five design patterns: on-demand initiation, micro-suggestions, voice anchoring, audience scaffolds, and point-of-decision provenance, to guide authorship-preserving writing tools.

### [371] [Fair Regression under Demographic Parity: A Unified Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10623)
*Yongzhen Feng,Weiwei Wang,Raymond K. W. Wong,Xianyang Zhang*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for solving fair regression tasks by minimizing risk while adhering to demographic parity constraints, using a unified and generalizable approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in fair regression tasks, particularly those constrained by demographic parity requirements, while improving applicability across diverse types of regression tasks.

Method: The authors propose a novel framework for fair risk minimization, present a new characterization of fair risk minimizers, and design an efficient estimation procedure to handle a variety of loss functions.

Result: The framework shows theoretical robustness with convergence rates and asymptotic consistency while providing numerical evidence for minimizing risks under fairness constraints across different regression contexts.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers a versatile, theoretically grounded, and computationally efficient solution for fair regression tasks applicable to various loss functions.

Abstract: We propose a unified framework for fair regression tasks formulated as risk minimization problems subject to a demographic parity constraint. Unlike many existing approaches that are limited to specific loss functions or rely on challenging non-convex optimization, our framework is applicable to a broad spectrum of regression tasks. Examples include linear regression with squared loss, binary classification with cross-entropy loss, quantile regression with pinball loss, and robust regression with Huber loss. We derive a novel characterization of the fair risk minimizer, which yields a computationally efficient estimation procedure for general loss functions. Theoretically, we establish the asymptotic consistency of the proposed estimator and derive its convergence rates under mild assumptions. We illustrate the method's versatility through detailed discussions of several common loss functions. Numerical results demonstrate that our approach effectively minimizes risk while satisfying fairness constraints across various regression settings.

### [372] [Adjusted Similarity Measures and a Violation of Expectations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10641)
*William L. Lippitt,Edward J. Bedrick,Nichole E. Carlson*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper addresses generalized methods for adjusting similarity measures to achieve meaningful interpretation, focusing on broader null models and statistical standardization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing similarity measures like Cohen’s kappa and Rand index are critical for comparing discrete labeling but face limitations under traditional null models and adjustment approaches.

Method: The authors generalize the adjustment operator to work with broader null models, establish sufficient conditions for its reliability, and analyze violations leading to breakdowns.

Result: The study identifies when traditional or generalized adjustment methods fail to produce intended properties, such as non-positive measures or deterministic values under certain conditions.

Conclusion: Adjusting similarity measures requires careful consideration of null distributions and their interaction with observed data to ensure meaningful and consistent outcomes.

Abstract: Adjusted similarity measures, such as Cohen's kappa for inter-rater reliability and the adjusted Rand index used to compare clustering algorithms, are a vital tool for comparing discrete labellings. These measures are intended to have the property of 0 expectation under a null distribution and maximum value 1 under maximal similarity to aid in interpretation. Measures are frequently adjusted with respect to the permutation distribution for historic and analytic reasons. There is currently renewed interest in considering other null models more appropriate for context, such as clustering ensembles permitting a random number of identified clusters. The purpose of this work is two -- fold: (1) to generalize the study of the adjustment operator to general null models and to a more general procedure which includes statistical standardization as a special case and (2) to identify sufficient conditions for the adjustment operator to produce the intended properties, where sufficient conditions are related to whether and how observed data are incorporated into null distributions. We demonstrate how violations of the sufficient conditions may lead to substantial breakdown, such as by producing a non-positive measure under traditional adjustment rather than one with mean 0, or by producing a measure which is deterministically 0 under statistical standardization.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of automatic speech recognition for Bengali, with its rich morphology and low-resource nature.

Method: Uses a Conformer-CTC model enhanced by multi-level embeddings (phoneme, syllable, wordpiece) along with preprocessing (e.g., silence trimming, SpecAugment).

Result: Achieved a 10.01% word error rate and a 5.03% character error rate, showcasing the model's effectiveness in Bengali ASR.

Conclusion: Combining multi-granular linguistic features with acoustic modeling offers a scalable, effective approach for low-resource ASR systems like Bengali.

Abstract: Bengali, spoken by over 300 million people, is a morphologically rich and lowresource language, posing challenges for automatic speech recognition (ASR). This research presents an end-to-end framework for Bengali ASR, building on a Conformer-CTC backbone with a multi-level embedding fusion mechanism that incorporates phoneme, syllable, and wordpiece representations. By enriching acoustic features with these linguistic embeddings, the model captures fine-grained phonetic cues and higher-level contextual patterns. The architecture employs early and late Conformer stages, with preprocessing steps including silence trimming, resampling, Log-Mel spectrogram extraction, and SpecAugment augmentation. The experimental results demonstrate the strong potential of the model, achieving a word error rate (WER) of 10.01% and a character error rate (CER) of 5.03%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining multi-granular linguistic information with acoustic modeling, providing a scalable approach for low-resource ASR development.

Motivation: Understanding cellular dynamics through video classification to advance biological process quantification.

Method: Organized a challenge (CBVCC) to benchmark 35 methods in three categories: tracking-derived features, end-to-end deep learning, and feature ensembling.

Result: Comparison of methods highlighting their strengths and limitations for cellular video analysis.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into improving computer vision techniques for cellular dynamics research.

Abstract: The classification of microscopy videos capturing complex cellular behaviors is crucial for understanding and quantifying the dynamics of biological processes over time. However, it remains a frontier in computer vision, requiring approaches that effectively model the shape and motion of objects without rigid boundaries, extract hierarchical spatiotemporal features from entire image sequences rather than static frames, and account for multiple objects within the field of view.
  To this end, we organized the Cell Behavior Video Classification Challenge (CBVCC), benchmarking 35 methods based on three approaches: classification of tracking-derived features, end-to-end deep learning architectures to directly learn spatiotemporal features from the entire video sequence without explicit cell tracking, or ensembling tracking-derived with image-derived features.
  We discuss the results achieved by the participants and compare the potential and limitations of each approach, serving as a basis to foster the development of computer vision methods for studying cellular dynamics.

### [376] [Multi-Objective Pareto-Front Optimization for Efficient Adaptive VVC Streaming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10607)
*Angeliki Katsenou,Vignesh V. Menon,Guoda Laurinaviciute,Benjamin Bross,Detlev Marpe*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Pareto-front optimization framework for adaptive video streaming that balances video quality, bitrate, and decoding complexity, achieving improved efficiency and Quality of Experience (QoE).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of achieving efficient adaptive video streaming by balancing bitrate, video quality, and decoding complexity for content- and codec-dependent scenarios.

Method: The framework introduces two strategies, JRQT-PF and JQT-PF, using Pareto-front optimization to construct versatile, quality-monotonic bitrate ladders for adaptive streaming. These strategies prioritize different tradeoffs between objectives.

Result: The methods achieved significant bitrate savings (up to 27.88%) and decoding time reduction by optimizing tradeoffs among objectives, outperforming existing benchmarks and ladder configurations.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that Pareto-front optimization under decoding time constraints results in sustainable, high-quality streaming solutions tailored to network and device constraints.

Abstract: Adaptive video streaming has facilitated improved video streaming over the past years. A balance among coding performance objectives such as bitrate, video quality, and decoding complexity is required to achieve efficient, content- and codec-dependent, adaptive video streaming. This paper proposes a multi-objective Pareto-front (PF) optimization framework to construct quality-monotonic, content-adaptive bitrate ladders Versatile Video Coding (VVC) streaming that jointly optimize video quality, bitrate, and decoding time, which is used as a practical proxy for decoding energy. Two strategies are introduced: the Joint Rate-Quality-Time Pareto Front (JRQT-PF) and the Joint Quality-Time Pareto Front (JQT-PF), each exploring different tradeoff formulations and objective prioritizations. The ladders are constructed under quality monotonicity constraints during adaptive streaming to ensure a consistent Quality of Experience (QoE). Experiments are conducted on a large-scale UHD dataset (Inter-4K), with quality assessed using PSNR, VMAF, and XPSNR, and complexity measured via decoding time and energy consumption. The JQT-PF method achieves 11.76% average bitrate savings while reducing average decoding time by 0.29% to maintain the same XPSNR, compared to a widely-used fixed ladder. More aggressive configurations yield up to 27.88% bitrate savings at the cost of increased complexity. The JRQT-PF strategy, on the other hand, offers more controlled tradeoffs, achieving 6.38 % bitrate savings and 6.17 % decoding time reduction. This framework outperforms existing methods, including fixed ladders, VMAF- and XPSNR-based dynamic resolution selection, and complexity-aware benchmarks. The results confirm that PF optimization with decoding time constraints enables sustainable, high-quality streaming tailored to network and device capabilities.
