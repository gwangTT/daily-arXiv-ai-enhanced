State-of-the-art\nmethods enhance the privacy-respecting convergence accuracy of federated GNN\ntraining by sharing remote embeddings of boundary vertices through a server\n(EmbC). However, they are limited by diminished performance due to large\ncommunication costs. In this article, we propose OptimES, an optimized\nfederated GNN training framework that employs remote neighbourhood pruning,\noverlapping the push of embeddings to the server with local training, and\ndynamic pulling of embeddings to reduce network costs and training time. We\nperform a rigorous evaluation of these strategies for four common graph\ndatasets with up to $111M$ vertices and $1.8B$ edges. We see that a modest drop\nin per-round accuracy due to the preemptive push of embeddings is out-stripped\nby the reduction in per-round training time for large and dense graphs like\nReddit and Products, converging up to $\\approx 3.5\\times$ faster than EmbC and\ngiving up to $\\approx16\\%$ better accuracy than the default federated GNN\nlearning.

To formalize Fed-Span, we offer a fresh perspective on MST/MSF\ntopologies by formulating them through a set of continuous constraint\nrepresentations (CCRs), thereby devising graph-theoretical abstractions into an\noptimizable framework for satellite networks. Using these CCRs, we obtain the\nenergy consumption and latency of operations in Fed-Span. Moreover, we derive\nnovel convergence bounds for non-convex machine learning loss functions,\naccommodating the key system characteristics and degrees of freedom of\nFed-Span. Finally, we propose a comprehensive optimization problem that jointly\nminimizes model prediction loss, energy consumption, and latency of Fed-Span.\nWe unveil that this problem is NP-hard and develop a systematic approach to\ntransform it into a geometric programming formulation, solved via successive\nconvex optimization with performance guarantees. Through evaluations on\nreal-world datasets, we demonstrate that Fed-Span outperforms existing methods,\nwith faster model convergence, greater energy efficiency, and reduced latency.\nThese results highlight Fed-Span as a novel solution for efficient distributed\nlearning in satellite networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper proposes Fed-Span, a new federated learning framework for low Earth orbit satellite networks, leveraging graph-theory and optimization for efficiency.", "motivation": "To address challenges in distributed learning for dynamic satellite networks, such as intermittent connectivity, varying computational capabilities, and changing datasets.", "method": "Fed-Span employs minimum spanning tree/forest topologies for model aggregation, uses continuous constraint representations for optimization, and transforms the optimization problem into a solvable geometric programming formulation.", "result": "Fed-Span achieves faster model convergence, improved energy efficiency, and reduced latency compared to existing methods, demonstrated through real-world datasets.", "conclusion": "Fed-Span is an effective and novel approach for optimizing distributed learning in satellite networks, showing significant performance improvements and practical feasibility."}}

CIFT uses a practical proxy for Information Fidelity\nbased on the feature-space geometry of a dataset. This enables the\nidentification of a phase transition, termed the Decoherence Point, where\ntraining stability degrades. The framework includes a generative engine,\nMulti-View Video Augmentation (MVAug), to synthesize a causally disentangled\ndata spectrum for this tuning process.

Fin-Ally is powered by\nCOMET-BART-embedded commonsense context and optimized with a Direct Preference\nOptimization (DPO) mechanism to generate human-aligned responses. The novel\nFin-Vault dataset, consisting of 1,417 annotated multi-turn dialogues, enables\nFin-Ally to extend beyond basic account management to provide personalized\nbudgeting, real-time expense tracking, and automated financial planning. Our\ncomprehensive results demonstrate that incorporating commonsense context\nenables language models to generate more refined, textually precise, and\nprofessionally grounded financial guidance, positioning this approach as a\nnext-generation AI solution for the FinTech sector.

In this paper, we\ninvestigate whether LRMs possess self-awareness of capability boundaries. We\nbegin by an observation that LRMs may know what they cannot solve through\nexpressed reasoning confidence. For black-box models, we find that reasoning\nexpressions reveal boundary signals, with accelerated growing confidence\ntrajectory for solvable problems but convergent uncertainty trajectory for\nunsolvable ones. For white-box models, we show that hidden states of the last\ninput token encode boundary information, with solvable and unsolvable problems\nlinearly separable even before reasoning begins. Building on these findings, we\npropose two simple yet effective optimization strategies: reasoning expression\nmonitoring and hidden states monitoring. Experiments demonstrate that these\nboundary-aware strategies enable LRMs to avoid unproductive reasoning without\nsacrificing accuracy, significantly improving reliability and efficiency by\ncutting token usage up to 62.7 - 93.6%.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper explores how Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) can recognize their own limitations, using confidence signals and hidden states to avoid engaging in unproductive reasoning, leading to improved efficiency.", "motivation": "To address the issue of LRMs wasting computational resources by engaging in unproductive reasoning on questions beyond their capability boundaries.", "method": "The authors analyzed expressed reasoning confidence and hidden states to identify solvability signals for both black-box and white-box models.

To address this issue, we propose a simple\nyet effective self-refining procedure: Point, Visualize, then Refine (Poivre).\nThis procedure enables a VLM to first mark its estimated point, then\niteratively refine the coordinates if necessary. Inspired by advances of\nreasoning models in the natural language domain, we employ reinforcement\nlearning (RL) to incentivize this self-refining ability. For the RL training,\nwe design a neat process reward that is not only empirically effective but also\ngrounded in appealing properties. Our trained model, Poivre-7B, sets a new\nstate of the art on Point-Bench, outperforming both proprietary models such as\nGemini-2.5-Pro and large open-source models such as Molmo-72B by over 3%.

Using AI\nmodels as `cognitive agents,' we collected millions of triplet odd-one-out\njudgments from a multimodal large language model (MLLM) and a language-only\nmodel (LLM) in response to 2,180 emotionally evocative videos.

A\ndrafter-based speculative decoding leverages one or more smaller language\nmodels, a.k.a. drafters or draft models, to sample a draft sequence or tree\nconsisting of multiple tokens, followed by verification by a base LLM, a target\nmodel, accepting a subset as its valid generation.
