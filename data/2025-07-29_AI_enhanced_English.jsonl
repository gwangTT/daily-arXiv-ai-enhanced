T-MPEDNet\nleverages a deep adaptive features backbone through a progressive\nencoder-decoder structure, enhanced by skip connections for recalibrating\nchannel-wise features while preserving spatial integrity. A\nTransformer-inspired dynamic attention mechanism captures long-range contextual\nrelationships within the spatial domain, further enhanced by multi-scale\nfeature utilization for refined local details, leading to accurate prediction.\nMorphological boundary refinement is then employed to address indistinct\nboundaries with neighboring organs, capturing finer details and yielding\nprecise boundary labels. The efficacy of T-MPEDNet is comprehensively assessed\non two widely utilized public benchmark datasets, LiTS and 3DIRCADb. Extensive\nquantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate the superiority of T-MPEDNet\ncompared to twelve state-of-the-art methods. On LiTS, T-MPEDNet achieves\noutstanding Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSC) of 97.6% and 89.1% for liver and\ntumor segmentation, respectively. Similar performance is observed on 3DIRCADb,\nwith DSCs of 98.3% and 83.3% for liver and tumor segmentation, respectively.\nOur findings prove that T-MPEDNet is an efficacious and reliable framework for\nautomated segmentation of the liver and its tumor in CT scans.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper introduces T-MPEDNet, a Transformer-based deep learning model, to enhance automated liver and tumor segmentation in CT scans, achieving superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.", "motivation": "Automated liver and tumor segmentation in CT scans is challenging due to tumor heterogeneity and diverse liver characteristics across patients, requiring advanced solutions for precise diagnosis and treatment planning.", "method": "The study develops T-MPEDNet, a Transformer-based multiscale encoder-decoder network with dynamic attention, progressive feature learning, and boundary refinement techniques to improve segmentation accuracy.", "result": "On benchmark datasets LiTS and 3DIRCADb, T-MPEDNet achieves highly accurate Dice Similarity Coefficients, surpassing twelve state-of-the-art methods.", "conclusion": "T-MPEDNet is a robust and effective framework for automated liver and tumor segmentation, offering a promising tool for clinical applications."}}

Previous studies\nreported that migration across CI services is a recurring need in open-source\ndevelopment. However, manual migration can be time-consuming and error-prone.\nThe state-of-the-art approach, CIMig, addresses this challenge by analyzing\npast migration examples to create service-specific rules and produce equivalent\nconfigurations across CI services. However, its relatively low accuracy raises\nconcerns about the overall feasibility of automated CI migration using\nrule-based techniques alone. Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs) have\ndemonstrated strong capabilities in code generation and transformation tasks,\nsuggesting potential to improve the automation, usability, and generalizability\nof CI configuration migration. This registered report presents a study in which\nwe aim to assess whether CI migration can be improved using LLMs. To this end,\nwe propose CIgrate, an LLM-based framework for automatically migrating CI\nconfigurations. We plan to evaluate the performance of CIgrate compared to\nCIMig as a baseline, in different setups (a) zero-shot/few-shot prompting of\nLLMs for configuration migration and (b) fine-tuning an LLM on a dataset of\nalready established CI service migrations.

We demonstrate that HFrame outperforms\nstandard graph neural networks by being able to distinguish more graph pairs\nwhere the pattern is not homomorphic to the graph. Additionally, we provide a\ngeneralization error bound for HFrame. Through experiments on both real-world\nand synthetic graphs, we show that HFrame is up to 101.91 times faster than\nexact matching algorithms and achieves an average accuracy of 0.962.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces HFrame, a novel graph neural network framework for efficiently addressing subgraph homomorphism problems, achieving high accuracy and speed.", "motivation": "Subgraph homomorphism is more complex than subgraph isomorphism due to the allowance of multiple vertices from the pattern mapping to the same graph vertex, necessitating new approaches.", "method": "HFrame integrates traditional algorithmic techniques and machine learning, leveraging graph neural networks to develop a framework for tackling subgraph homomorphism efficiently.", "result": "Experiments demonstrate HFrame's significant performance improvements, being up to 101.91 times faster than exact matching methods and achieving an average accuracy of 0.962.", "conclusion": "The HFrame framework not only improves computational efficiency but also enhances the distinction of graph pairs in subgraph homomorphism problems."}}

Moreover, we introduce a new momentum-based stochastic\ncontrolled weight averaging FL algorithm (\\texttt{FedMoSWA}), which is designed\nto better align local and global models.\n  Theoretically, we provide both convergence analysis and generalization bounds\nfor \\texttt{FedSWA} and \\texttt{FedMoSWA}. We also prove that the optimization\nand generalization errors of \\texttt{FedMoSWA} are smaller than those of their\ncounterparts, including FedSAM and its variants.

To evaluate the framework's effectiveness, we conducted daily\nlife simulations and extended the evaluation metrics to self-influence,\none-influence, and group-influence, selection five classic psychological\nexperiments for simulation. The results show that the PSYA framework generates\nmore natural, consistent, diverse, and credible behaviors, successfully\nreplicating human experimental outcomes.

Critically, ChoreoMuse supports\nstyle-controllable, high-fidelity dance video generation across diverse musical\ngenres and individual dancer characteristics, including the flexibility to\nhandle any reference individual at any resolution. Our method employs a novel\nmusic encoder MotionTune to capture motion cues from audio, ensuring that the\ngenerated choreography closely follows the beat and expressive qualities of the\ninput music. To quantitatively evaluate how well the generated dances match\nboth musical and choreographic styles, we introduce two new metrics that\nmeasure alignment with the intended stylistic cues. Extensive experiments\nconfirm that ChoreoMuse achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple\ndimensions, including video quality, beat alignment, dance diversity, and style\nadherence, demonstrating its potential as a robust solution for a wide range of\ncreative applications.

Such updates are typically performed through handoff\n(HO) operations; however, frequent HOs lead to overheads associated with the\nallocation and release of resources. This paper presents a deep reinforcement\nlearning (DRL)-based solution to predict and manage these connections for\nmobile users. Our solution employs the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm, with\ncontinuous action space representation, to train a deep neural network to serve\nas the HO policy. We present a novel proposition for a reward function that\nintegrates a HO penalty in order to balance the attainable rate and the\nassociated overhead related to HOs. We develop two variants of our system; the\nfirst one uses mobility direction-assisted (DA) observations that are based on\nthe user movement pattern, while the second one uses history-assisted (HA)\nobservations that are based on the history of the large-scale fading (LSF).\nSimulation results show that our DRL-based continuous action space approach is\nmore scalable than discrete space counterpart, and that our derived HO policy\nautomatically learns to gather HOs in specific time slots to minimize the\noverhead of initiating HOs.
