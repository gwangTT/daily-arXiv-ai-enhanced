### [1] [Renewable Energy Sources Selection Analysis with the Maximizing Deviation Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07011)
*Kirisci Murat*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study combines Fermatean fuzzy sets and the deviation maximization method in multi-criteria decision-making to address uncertainty in selecting renewable energy sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the critical issue of selecting renewable energy sources, which directly impacts carbon emission reduction and global climate change mitigation.

Method: The authors introduced an optimization model using deviation maximization combined with interval-valued Fermatean fuzzy sets for determining partially known feature weights.

Result: The proposed method was applied to renewable energy source selection and demonstrated to effectively integrate technical, managerial, and political considerations.

Conclusion: The developed approach offers a robust solution to handle uncertainty in decision-making scenarios like renewable energy source selection, emphasizing its real-world implications.

Abstract: Multi-criteria decision-making methods provide decision-makers with
appropriate tools to make better decisions in uncertain, complex, and
conflicting situations. Fuzzy set theory primarily deals with the uncertainty
inherent in human thoughts and perceptions and attempts to quantify this
uncertainty. Fuzzy logic and fuzzy set theory are utilized with multi-criteria
decision-making methods because they effectively handle uncertainty and
fuzziness in decision-makers' judgments, allowing for verbal judgments of the
problem. This study utilizes the Fermatean fuzzy environment, a generalization
of fuzzy sets. An optimization model based on the deviation maximization method
is proposed to determine partially known feature weights. This method is
combined with interval-valued Fermatean fuzzy sets. The proposed method was
applied to the problem of selecting renewable energy sources. The reason for
choosing renewable energy sources is that meeting energy needs from renewable
sources, balancing carbon emissions, and mitigating the effects of global
climate change are among the most critical issues of the recent period. Even
though selecting renewable energy sources is a technical issue, the managerial
and political implications of this issue are also important, and are discussed
in this study.

### [2] [From Eigenmodes to Proofs: Integrating Graph Spectral Operators with Symbolic Interpretable Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07017)
*Andrew Kiruluta,Priscilla Burity*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Spectral NSR is a spectral neuro-symbolic reasoning framework leveraging graph signal processing for scalable and interpretable reasoning. It improves accuracy, robustness, and interpretability on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to unify the interpretability of symbolic reasoning with the scalability of spectral learning and address the limitations of existing reasoning systems.

Method: The authors introduce Spectral NSR, which embeds logical rules as spectral templates and performs inference in the graph spectral domain, incorporating advanced techniques like dynamic graph learning and spectral filtering.

Result: Spectral NSR outperforms state-of-the-art models in accuracy, inference speed, robustness to adversarial perturbations, and interpretability on reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Spectral NSR demonstrates a scalable and principled approach to reasoning, providing transparency and robustness surpassing conventional methods.

Abstract: We introduce Spectral NSR, a fully spectral neuro-symbolic reasoning
framework that embeds logical rules as spectral templates and performs
inference directly in the graph spectral domain. By leveraging graph signal
processing (GSP) and frequency-selective filters grounded in the Laplacian
eigenstructure of knowledge graphs, the architecture unifies the
interpretability of symbolic reasoning with the scalability and adaptability of
spectral learning. Beyond the core formulation, we incorporate a comprehensive
set of extensions, including dynamic graph and basis learning, rational and
diffusion filters for sharper spectral selectivity, mixture-of-spectral-experts
for modular specialization, proof-guided training with spectral curricula, and
uncertainty quantification for calibrated confidence. Additional enhancements
such as large language model coupling, co-spectral transfer alignment,
adversarial robustness, efficient GPU kernels, generalized Laplacians, and
causal interventions further expand the versatility of the framework.
  Empirical evaluation on state-of-the-art reasoning benchmarks such as
ProofWriter and CLUTRR demonstrates that Spectral NSR achieves superior
accuracy, faster inference, improved robustness to adversarial perturbations,
and higher interpretability compared to leading baselines including
transformers, message-passing neural networks, and neuro-symbolic logic
programming systems. Spectral attribution and proof-band agreement analyses
confirm that model decisions align closely with symbolic proof structures,
while transfer experiments validate effective domain adaptation through
co-spectral alignment. These results establish Spectral NSR as a scalable and
principled foundation for the next generation of reasoning systems, offering
transparency, robustness, and generalization beyond conventional approaches.

### [3] [Statistical Methods in Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07054)
*Edgar Dobriban*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper reviews how statistical methods can enhance the reliability, evaluation, and experimentation in generative AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of guarantees in correctness, safety, fairness, and other properties in generative AI models while improving their evaluation and experimentation.

Method: A review of existing statistical methods and their applications to generative AI, alongside a discussion of limitations and future directions.

Result: Outlined statistical techniques and highlighted their current and potential roles in generative AI systems.

Conclusion: Statistical methods hold promise for improving the reliability, quality, and evaluation of generative AI, but there are challenges and opportunities for further exploration.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence is emerging as an important technology,
promising to be transformative in many areas. At the same time, generative AI
techniques are based on sampling from probabilistic models, and by default,
they come with no guarantees about correctness, safety, fairness, or other
properties. Statistical methods offer a promising potential approach to improve
the reliability of generative AI techniques. In addition, statistical methods
are also promising for improving the quality and efficiency of AI evaluation,
as well as for designing interventions and experiments in AI.
  In this paper, we review some of the existing work on these topics,
explaining both the general statistical techniques used, as well as their
applications to generative AI. We also discuss limitations and potential future
directions.

### [4] [Instruction Agent: Enhancing Agent with Expert Demonstration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07098)
*Yinheng Li,Hailey Hultquist,Justin Wagle,Kazuhito Koishida*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes an advanced GUI agent called Instruction Agent that successfully addresses challenges with complex tasks by employing expert demonstrations and novel modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GUI agents struggle with novel UI elements, complex workflows, and maintaining user-intended trajectories, prompting the need for a better solution.

Method: The Instruction Agent uses expert demonstrations to extract step-by-step instructions and includes two critical modules—a verifier and a backtracker—to ensure robust execution and recovery from interruptions.

Result: Instruction Agent achieves a 60% success rate on challenging tasks in OSWorld, outperforming top-ranked existing agents.

Conclusion: The Instruction Agent presents a practical and extendable framework for improving GUI task automation and bridging the gap between existing agents and real-world requirements.

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents have advanced rapidly but still
struggle with complex tasks involving novel UI elements, long-horizon actions,
and personalized trajectories. In this work, we introduce Instruction Agent, a
GUI agent that leverages expert demonstrations to solve such tasks, enabling
completion of otherwise difficult workflows. Given a single demonstration, the
agent extracts step-by-step instructions and executes them by strictly
following the trajectory intended by the user, which avoids making mistakes
during execution. The agent leverages the verifier and backtracker modules
further to improve robustness. Both modules are critical to understand the
current outcome from each action and handle unexpected interruptions(such as
pop-up windows) during execution. Our experiments show that Instruction Agent
achieves a 60% success rate on a set of tasks in OSWorld that all top-ranked
agents failed to complete. The Instruction Agent offers a practical and
extensible framework, bridging the gap between current GUI agents and reliable
real-world GUI task automation.

### [5] [Neuro-Symbolic Frameworks: Conceptual Characterization and Empirical Comparative Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07122)
*Sania Sinha,Tanawan Premsri,Danial Kamali,Parisa Kordjamshidi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper characterizes technical facets of Neurosymbolic (NeSy) frameworks, highlighting challenges and showcasing frameworks like DeepProbLog, Scallop, and DomiKnowS to encourage innovation in the field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NeSy frameworks combine neural representation with symbolic reasoning, offering powerful problem-solving but currently suffer from a steep learning curve, lack of user-friendly tools, and inadequate unifying frameworks.

Method: The authors analyze existing NeSy frameworks by examining their aspects, such as symbolic language, neural model integration, and algorithms, and showcase three examples to highlight their capabilities and problems.

Result: The study identifies key challenges, such as the lack of expressivity and declarative problem specification, within NeSy frameworks, using the examples they analyze as a basis for understanding.

Conclusion: The authors advocate for transformative actions and encourage the scientific community to rethink how the challenges of NeSy frameworks can be addressed more effectively.

Abstract: Neurosymbolic (NeSy) frameworks combine neural representations and learning
with symbolic representations and reasoning. Combining the reasoning
capacities, explainability, and interpretability of symbolic processing with
the flexibility and power of neural computing allows us to solve complex
problems with more reliability while being data-efficient. However, this
recently growing topic poses a challenge to developers with its learning curve,
lack of user-friendly tools, libraries, and unifying frameworks. In this paper,
we characterize the technical facets of existing NeSy frameworks, such as the
symbolic representation language, integration with neural models, and the
underlying algorithms. A majority of the NeSy research focuses on algorithms
instead of providing generic frameworks for declarative problem specification
to leverage problem solving. To highlight the key aspects of Neurosymbolic
modeling, we showcase three generic NeSy frameworks - \textit{DeepProbLog},
\textit{Scallop}, and \textit{DomiKnowS}. We identify the challenges within
each facet that lay the foundation for identifying the expressivity of each
framework in solving a variety of problems. Building on this foundation, we aim
to spark transformative action and encourage the community to rethink this
problem in novel ways.

### [6] [Autoencoder-Based Denoising of Muscle Artifacts in ECG to Preserve Skin Nerve Activity (SKNA) for Cognitive Stress Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07146)
*Farnoush Baghestani,Jihye Moon,Youngsun Kong,Ki Chon*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study proposes a deep learning method to reconstruct clean Skin Nerve Activity (SKNA) from electromyographic (EMG) noise in ECG recordings using a convolutional autoencoder with an LSTM bottleneck.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate tracking of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) using SKNA is hindered by EMG noise contamination, especially during physical activities. This limits its robustness in practical settings.

Method: The authors simulated realistic noise levels using clean SKNA data and artificial EMG noise. They trained a deep learning model, a 1D convolutional autoencoder with an LSTM bottleneck, using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation.

Result: The method significantly improved signal-to-noise ratio, cross-correlation, and discriminability of SKNA features, achieving high classification accuracy (91-98%) even under severe noise.

Conclusion: Deep learning can effectively denoise SKNA, preserving physiologically relevant data in noisy environments, broadening the scope for practical use of SKNA monitoring in movement-rich real-world conditions.

Abstract: The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) plays a central role in regulating the
body's responses to stress and maintaining physiological stability. Its
dysregulation is associated with a wide range of conditions, from
cardiovascular disease to anxiety disorders. Skin nerve activity (SKNA)
extracted from high-frequency electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings provides a
noninvasive window into SNS dynamics, but its measurement is highly susceptible
to electromyographic (EMG) contamination. Traditional preprocessing based on
bandpass filtering within a fixed range (e.g., 500--1000 Hz) is susceptible to
overlapping EMG and SKNA spectral components, especially during sustained
muscle activity. We present a denoising approach using a lightweight
one-dimensional convolutional autoencoder with a long short-term memory (LSTM)
bottleneck to reconstruct clean SKNA from EMG-contaminated recordings. Using
clean ECG-derived SKNA data from cognitive stress experiments and EMG noise
from chaotic muscle stimulation recordings, we simulated contamination at
realistic noise levels (--4 dB, --8 dB signal-to-noise ratio) and trained the
model in the leave-one-subject-out cross-validation framework. The method
improved signal-to-noise ratio by up to 9.65 dB, increased cross correlation
with clean SKNA from 0.40 to 0.72, and restored burst-based SKNA features to
near-clean discriminability (AUROC $\geq$ 0.96). Classification of baseline
versus sympathetic stimulation (cognitive stress) conditions reached accuracies
of 91--98\% across severe noise levels, comparable to clean data. These results
demonstrate that deep learning--based reconstruction can preserve
physiologically relevant sympathetic bursts during substantial EMG
interference, enabling more robust SKNA monitoring in naturalistic,
movement-rich environments.

### [7] [PaVeRL-SQL: Text-to-SQL via Partial-Match Rewards and Verbal Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07159)
*Heng Hao,Wenjun Hu,Oxana Verkholyak,Davoud Ataee Tarzanagh,Baruch Gutow,Sima Didari,Masoud Faraki,Hankyu Moon,Seungjai Min*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces PaVeRL-SQL, a framework with novel reinforcement learning strategies to improve Text-to-SQL models' execution accuracy, especially in industrial-scale and complex scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Text-to-SQL models struggle with low execution accuracy on complex, industry-scale databases, particularly when handling domain-specific business logic. The motivation of the paper is to address these challenges and improve performance in real-world scenarios.

Method: The authors propose two pipelines: (1) a verbal reinforcement learning (verbal-RL) pipeline with an in-context group self-evaluation framework using both open- and closed-source large language models, and (2) a chain-of-thought (CoT) reinforcement learning pipeline utilizing a smaller backbone model (OmniSQL-7B) trained with a custom reward function and two-stage RL.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art results on Spider, Spider 2.0, and BIRD benchmarks. On the challenging Spider2.0-SQLite benchmark, the verbal-RL pipeline exceeds the current SOTA execution accuracy by 7.4%, and the CoT pipeline by 1.4%. Additionally, RL training with mixed SQL dialects provides significant improvements for dialects with limited data.

Conclusion: PaVeRL-SQL sets a new benchmark in Text-to-SQL performance under industrial constraints, demonstrating reliable and scalable improvements through advanced reinforcement learning techniques.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL models allow users to interact with a database more easily by
generating executable SQL statements from natural-language questions. Despite
recent successes on simpler databases and questions, current Text-to-SQL
methods still suffer from low execution accuracy on industry-scale databases
and complex questions involving domain-specific business logic. We present
\emph{PaVeRL-SQL}, a framework that combines \emph{Partial-Match Rewards} and
\emph{Verbal Reinforcement Learning} to drive self-improvement in reasoning
language models (RLMs) for Text-to-SQL. To handle practical use cases, we adopt
two pipelines: (1) a newly designed in-context learning framework with group
self-evaluation (verbal-RL), using capable open- and closed-source large
language models (LLMs) as backbones; and (2) a chain-of-thought (CoT) RL
pipeline with a small backbone model (OmniSQL-7B) trained with a specially
designed reward function and two-stage RL. These pipelines achieve
state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on popular Text-to-SQL benchmarks -- Spider,
Spider 2.0, and BIRD. For the industrial-level Spider2.0-SQLite benchmark, the
verbal-RL pipeline achieves an execution accuracy 7.4\% higher than SOTA, and
the CoT pipeline is 1.4\% higher. RL training with mixed SQL dialects yields
strong, threefold gains, particularly for dialects with limited training data.
Overall, \emph{PaVeRL-SQL} delivers reliable, SOTA Text-to-SQL under realistic
industrial constraints. The code is available at
https://github.com/PaVeRL-SQL/PaVeRL-SQL.

### [8] [That's So FETCH: Fashioning Ensemble Techniques for LLM Classification in Civil Legal Intake and Referral](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07170)
*Quinten Steenhuis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents FETCH, a classifier that improves legal issue classification using hybrid LLM/ML and follow-up questions, achieving 97.37% accuracy, surpassing GPT-5.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inaccuracies in legal issue classification that can lead to serious consequences such as missed deadlines or loss of housing.

Method: A classification system called FETCH, which combines a hybrid LLM/ML ensemble and automated follow-up questions to enhance problem narratives.

Result: FETCH achieves a hits@2 accuracy of 97.37% on a dataset of 419 real-world queries, outperforming GPT-5.

Conclusion: The introduced method significantly improves classification accuracy, reduces costs, and ensures users of the legal system are matched to the right resource efficiently.

Abstract: Each year millions of people seek help for their legal problems by calling a
legal aid program hotline, walking into a legal aid office, or using a lawyer
referral service. The first step to match them to the right help is to identify
the legal problem the applicant is experiencing. Misdirection has consequences.
Applicants may miss a deadline, experience physical abuse, lose housing or lose
custody of children while waiting to connect to the right legal help. We
introduce and evaluate the FETCH classifier for legal issue classification and
describe two methods for improving accuracy: a hybrid LLM/ML ensemble
classification method, and the automatic generation of follow-up questions to
enrich the initial problem narrative. We employ a novel data set of 419
real-world queries to a nonprofit lawyer referral service. Ultimately, we show
classification accuracy (hits@2) of 97.37\% using a mix of inexpensive models,
exceeding the performance of the current state-of-the-art GPT-5 model. Our
approach shows promise in significantly reducing the cost of guiding users of
the legal system to the right resource for their problem while achieving high
accuracy.

### [9] [A Hybrid CNN-LSTM Deep Learning Model for Intrusion Detection in Smart Grid](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07208)
*Abdulhakim Alsaiari,Mohammad Ilyas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid deep learning Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using CNN and LSTM for enhancing the cybersecurity of smart grids, achieving a 99.70% detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address rising cybersecurity vulnerabilities in smart grids due to advanced communication technologies and renewable energy integration, focusing particularly on SCADA protocols.

Method: The method involves using CNN for feature extraction and LSTM for recognizing temporal patterns to develop an IDS. The model is trained and evaluated using DNP3 and IEC104 intrusion detection datasets.

Result: The proposed CNN-LSTM hybrid model demonstrated significant improvements in detection metrics, achieving a detection accuracy of 99.70%.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the hybrid CNN-LSTM approach is highly effective for improving smart grid cybersecurity, outperforming other deep learning methods in accuracy and reliability.

Abstract: The evolution of the traditional power grid into the "smart grid" has
resulted in a fundamental shift in energy management, which allows the
integration of renewable energy sources with modern communication technology.
However, this interconnection has increased smart grids' vulnerability to
attackers, which might result in privacy breaches, operational interruptions,
and massive outages. The SCADA-based smart grid protocols are critical for
real-time data collection and control, but they are vulnerable to attacks like
unauthorized access and denial of service (DoS). This research proposes a
hybrid deep learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) intended to improve
the cybersecurity of smart grids. The suggested model takes advantage of
Convolutional Neural Networks' (CNN) feature extraction capabilities as well as
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks' temporal pattern recognition skills.
DNP3 and IEC104 intrusion detection datasets are employed to train and test our
CNN-LSTM model to recognize and classify the potential cyber threats. Compared
to other deep learning approaches, the results demonstrate considerable
improvements in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with a detection
accuracy of 99.70%.

*Nicholas Sung,Steven Spreizer,Mohamed Elrefaie,Kaira Samuel,Matthew C. Jones,Faez Ahmed*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BlendedNet offers a dataset of 999 blended wing body (BWB) geometries with aerodynamic simulations across various flight conditions, aimed at advancing data-driven surrogate modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address data scarcity in unconventional aerodynamic configurations and promote the development of data-driven surrogate models for aerodynamic design.

Method: The dataset consists of RANS simulations with Spalart-Allmaras modeling for 999 BWB geometries, paired with an end-to-end surrogate framework using PointNet and FiLM networks for pointwise aerodynamic prediction.

Result: Experiments demonstrate low prediction errors for surface quantities like Cp, Cfx, and Cfz across diverse blended wing body configurations.

Conclusion: BlendedNet is a valuable resource for advancing aerodynamic design research, especially for data-driven modeling with unconventional airframes.

Abstract: BlendedNet is a publicly available aerodynamic dataset of 999 blended wing
body (BWB) geometries. Each geometry is simulated across about nine flight
conditions, yielding 8830 converged RANS cases with the Spalart-Allmaras model
and 9 to 14 million cells per case. The dataset is generated by sampling
geometric design parameters and flight conditions, and includes detailed
pointwise surface quantities needed to study lift and drag. We also introduce
an end-to-end surrogate framework for pointwise aerodynamic prediction. The
pipeline first uses a permutation-invariant PointNet regressor to predict
geometric parameters from sampled surface point clouds, then conditions a
Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) network on the predicted parameters and
flight conditions to predict pointwise coefficients Cp, Cfx, and Cfz.
Experiments show low errors in surface predictions across diverse BWBs.
BlendedNet addresses data scarcity for unconventional configurations and
enables research on data-driven surrogate modeling for aerodynamic design.

*Xin Wang,Ting Dang,Xinyu Zhang,Vassilis Kostakos,Michael J. Witbrock,Hong Jia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores Small Language Models (SLMs) as lightweight alternatives to Large Language Models (LLMs) for healthcare predictions on portable devices, ensuring privacy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address privacy concerns, memory usage, and latency in cloud-based LLM healthcare solutions by investigating the applicability of compact, locally deployable SLMs.

Method: SLMs were systematically evaluated for health prediction tasks using zero-shot learning, few-shot learning, and instruction fine-tuning. Best-performing SLMs were tested on mobile devices for real-world efficiency.

Result: SLMs demonstrated comparable performance to LLMs in healthcare prediction tasks while offering advantages in efficiency and data privacy. Challenges like class imbalance and limited few-shot capabilities remain.

Conclusion: SLMs are a promising tool for privacy-preserving healthcare monitoring, showing potential for local deployment despite some current limitations.

Abstract: Mobile and wearable healthcare monitoring play a vital role in facilitating
timely interventions, managing chronic health conditions, and ultimately
improving individuals' quality of life. Previous studies on large language
models (LLMs) have highlighted their impressive generalization abilities and
effectiveness in healthcare prediction tasks. However, most LLM-based
healthcare solutions are cloud-based, which raises significant privacy concerns
and results in increased memory usage and latency. To address these challenges,
there is growing interest in compact models, Small Language Models (SLMs),
which are lightweight and designed to run locally and efficiently on mobile and
wearable devices. Nevertheless, how well these models perform in healthcare
prediction remains largely unexplored. We systematically evaluated SLMs on
health prediction tasks using zero-shot, few-shot, and instruction fine-tuning
approaches, and deployed the best performing fine-tuned SLMs on mobile devices
to evaluate their real-world efficiency and predictive performance in practical
healthcare scenarios. Our results show that SLMs can achieve performance
comparable to LLMs while offering substantial gains in efficiency and privacy.
However, challenges remain, particularly in handling class imbalance and
few-shot scenarios. These findings highlight SLMs, though imperfect in their
current form, as a promising solution for next-generation, privacy-preserving
healthcare monitoring.

### [13] [Performative Thinking? The Brittle Correlation Between CoT Length and Problem Complexity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07339)
*Vardhan Palod,Karthik Valmeekam,Kaya Stechly,Subbarao Kambhampati*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study investigates the assumption that producing longer reasoning traces in models reflects problem complexity. It finds limited correlation and highlights distributional distance from training data as a key factor rather than inherent problem complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand the mechanisms behind intermediate token generation in language models and challenges the prevailing belief that longer reasoning traces indicate higher computational effort or problem complexity.

Method: Transformer models were trained on derivational traces from the A* algorithm to analyze correlations between problem difficulty (quantified by A* operations) and generated reasoning traces.

Result: Long reasoning traces often failed to solve even simple tasks and loosely correlated with problem complexity. Correlation mainly appeared when problems were close to the training distribution.

Conclusion: Intermediate token generation is not inherently adaptive to problem complexity but is influenced by training data similarity. Longer traces should not be automatically equated with greater computational effort or 'thinking.'

Abstract: Intermediate token generation (ITG), where a model produces output before the
solution, has been proposed as a method to improve the performance of language
models on reasoning tasks. While these reasoning traces or Chain of Thoughts
(CoTs) are correlated with performance gains, the mechanisms underlying them
remain unclear. A prevailing assumption in the community has been to
anthropomorphize these tokens as "thinking", treating longer traces as evidence
of higher problem-adaptive computation. In this work, we critically examine
whether intermediate token sequence length reflects or correlates with problem
difficulty. To do so, we train transformer models from scratch on derivational
traces of the A* search algorithm, where the number of operations required to
solve a maze problem provides a precise and verifiable measure of problem
complexity. We first evaluate the models on trivial free-space problems,
finding that even for the simplest tasks, they often produce excessively long
reasoning traces and sometimes fail to generate a solution. We then
systematically evaluate the model on out-of-distribution problems and find that
the intermediate token length and ground truth A* trace length only loosely
correlate. We notice that the few cases where correlation appears are those
where the problems are closer to the training distribution, suggesting that the
effect arises from approximate recall rather than genuine problem-adaptive
computation. This suggests that the inherent computational complexity of the
problem instance is not a significant factor, but rather its distributional
distance from the training data. These results challenge the assumption that
intermediate trace generation is adaptive to problem difficulty and caution
against interpreting longer sequences in systems like R1 as automatically
indicative of "thinking effort".

*Cunxi Yu,Rongjian Liang,Chia-Tung Ho,Haoxing Ren*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SATLUTION utilizes large language models (LLMs) to evolve code for SAT solver repositories at a full repository scale, achieving superior solutions compared to human-designed ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspired by AlphaEvolve's success in autonomous LLM-based code improvement for isolated kernel-level tasks, the authors aimed to apply LLM agents to evolve code bases on a larger, repository-wide scale for SAT solvers.

Method: SATLUTION employs LLM agents to iteratively improve SAT solver repositories by ensuring correctness, integrating distributed runtime feedback, and self-evolving evolutionary policies.

Result: SATLUTION successfully evolved SAT solvers from SAT Competition 2024 repositories that outperformed both the 2024 and 2025 human-designed winners on the respective benchmarks.

Conclusion: LLM-driven autonomous code evolution at repository scale, as with SATLUTION, can yield results surpassing human experts in complex problem-solving domains such as SAT solving.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong coding abilities,
enabling not only static code generation but also iterative code self-evolving
through agentic frameworks. Recently, AlphaEvolve \cite{novikov2025alphaevolve}
demonstrated that LLM-based coding agents can autonomously improve algorithms
and surpass human experts, with scopes limited to isolated kernels spanning
hundreds of lines of code. Inspired by AlphaEvolve, we present SATLUTION, the
first framework to extend LLM-based code evolution to the full repository
scale, encompassing hundreds of files and tens of thousands of lines of C/C++
code. Targeting Boolean Satisfiability (SAT), the canonical NP-complete problem
and a cornerstone of both theory and applications. SATLUTION orchestrates LLM
agents to directly evolve solver repositories under strict correctness
guarantees and distributed runtime feedback, while simultaneously self-evolving
its own evolution policies and rules. Starting from SAT Competition 2024
codebases and benchmark, SATLUTION evolved solvers that decisively outperformed
the human-designed winners of the SAT Competition 2025, and also surpassed both
2024 and 2025 champions on the 2024 benchmarks.

### [15] [Language Self-Play For Data-Free Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07414)
*Jakub Grudzien Kuba,Mengting Gu,Qi Ma,Yuandong Tian,Vijai Mohan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Language Self-Play (LSP), a reinforcement learning approach allowing language models to improve performance without additional data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the data bottleneck in training large language models by finding a way for models to improve without relying on increasing amounts of external data.

Method: The proposed method, LSP, uses a game-theoretic framework where the model competes with itself iteratively in a self-play scenario to enhance its abilities.

Result: Experiments with Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct demonstrate that models can improve on complex tasks solely through self-play, surpassing traditional data-driven methods.

Conclusion: LSP provides an effective and data-independent approach to refining language models, reducing reliance on external data resources while achieving significant performance gains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent years, driven by
scale, abundant high-quality training data, and reinforcement learning. Yet
this progress faces a fundamental bottleneck: the need for ever more data from
which models can continue to learn. In this work, we propose a reinforcement
learning approach that removes this dependency by enabling models to improve
without additional data. Our method leverages a game-theoretic framework of
self-play, where a model's capabilities are cast as performance in a
competitive game and stronger policies emerge by having the model play against
itself - a process we call Language Self-Play (LSP). Experiments with
Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct on instruction-following benchmarks show that pretrained
models can not only enhance their performance on challenging tasks through
self-play alone, but can also do so more effectively than data-driven
baselines.

### [16] [SheetDesigner: MLLM-Powered Spreadsheet Layout Generation with Rule-Based and Vision-Based Reflection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07473)
*Qin Chen,Yuanyi Ren,Xiaojun Ma,Mugeng Liu,Han Shi,Dongmei Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of automating spreadsheet layout design using SheetDesigner, a framework powered by Multimodal Large Language Models. It highlights the limitations of current methods and introduces evaluation protocols and a dataset of spreadsheets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spreadsheets are vital tools for data-centric tasks, yet manual layout design is time-intensive and requires expertise. Automation is needed to streamline the process, but existing solutions fail to align with the grid-based discrete structure and semantic connectivity unique to spreadsheets.

Method: The authors formalized the task of spreadsheet layout generation and created a seven-criterion evaluation protocol alongside a dataset of 3,326 spreadsheets. They developed SheetDesigner, a zero-shot, training-free framework leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models combined with rule and vision reflection strategies for component placement and content population.

Result: SheetDesigner surpassed five baseline methods by at least 22.6% in performance. It demonstrated strengths in handling layout overlap and balance using vision modality, though encountered difficulties in achieving proper alignment, necessitating hybrid strategies.

Conclusion: This paper presents SheetDesigner as an effective framework for automating spreadsheet layout design, addressing key limitations of existing approaches. While it shows promising results, further refinement is suggested, especially in alignment challenges, for comprehensive implementation.

Abstract: Spreadsheets are critical to data-centric tasks, with rich, structured
layouts that enable efficient information transmission. Given the time and
expertise required for manual spreadsheet layout design, there is an urgent
need for automated solutions. However, existing automated layout models are
ill-suited to spreadsheets, as they often (1) treat components as axis-aligned
rectangles with continuous coordinates, overlooking the inherently discrete,
grid-based structure of spreadsheets; and (2) neglect interrelated semantics,
such as data dependencies and contextual links, unique to spreadsheets. In this
paper, we first formalize the spreadsheet layout generation task, supported by
a seven-criterion evaluation protocol and a dataset of 3,326 spreadsheets. We
then introduce SheetDesigner, a zero-shot and training-free framework using
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that combines rule and vision
reflection for component placement and content population. SheetDesigner
outperforms five baselines by at least 22.6\%. We further find that through
vision modality, MLLMs handle overlap and balance well but struggle with
alignment, necessitates hybrid rule and visual reflection strategies. Our codes
and data is available at Github.

*Riccardo DElia,Alberto Termine,Francesco Flammini*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid framework combining Deep Learning and System Dynamics models to enhance interpretability and causal reliability for transportation logistics applications in the context of cyber-physical systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to address the balance between predictive accuracy provided by Deep Learning and the loss of explainability and causal reliability which are critical in decision-making systems.

Method: The framework integrates techniques from Concept-Based Interpretability, Mechanistic Interpretability, and Causal Machine Learning with Deep Learning to create interpretable neural network models using meaningful variables.

Result: The approach creates neural models that retain both the predictive power of Deep Learning and the causal grounding of traditional System Dynamics models, making them suitable for critical decision-making in multimodal logistic scenarios.

Conclusion: The hybrid framework demonstrates that neuro-symbolic methods can effectively combine interpretability and predictive performance, supporting data-driven decision-making in complex logistical and cyber-physical systems.

Abstract: The integration of Deep Learning (DL) in System Dynamics (SD) modeling for
transportation logistics offers significant advantages in scalability and
predictive accuracy. However, these gains are often offset by the loss of
explainability and causal reliability $-$ key requirements in critical
decision-making systems. This paper presents a novel framework for
interpretable-by-design neural system dynamics modeling that synergizes DL with
techniques from Concept-Based Interpretability, Mechanistic Interpretability,
and Causal Machine Learning. The proposed hybrid approach enables the
construction of neural network models that operate on semantically meaningful
and actionable variables, while retaining the causal grounding and transparency
typical of traditional SD models. The framework is conceived to be applied to
real-world case-studies from the EU-funded project AutoMoTIF, focusing on
data-driven decision support, automation, and optimization of multimodal
logistic terminals. We aim at showing how neuro-symbolic methods can bridge the
gap between black-box predictive models and the need for critical decision
support in complex dynamical environments within cyber-physical systems enabled
by the industrial Internet-of-Things.

### [18] [Transferable Direct Prompt Injection via Activation-Guided MCMC Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07617)
*Minghui Li,Hao Zhang,Yechao Zhang,Wei Wan,Shengshan Hu,pei Xiaobing,Jing Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper tackles security threats posed by Direct Prompt Injection attacks on LLMs. It introduces an activation-guided attack framework that leverages surrogate models for energy evaluation and Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling for optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct Prompt Injection attacks have emerged as a major security concern for LLMs, due to their ease of execution and potential for significant impact. Existing methods either lack practicality or suffer from poor transferability.

Method: An Energy-based Model (EBM) is constructed using surrogate model activations. Then, token-level Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling optimizes adversarial prompts for gradient-free black-box attack setup.

Result: The proposed method achieves a 49.6% attack success rate across five major LLMs with a 34.6% improvement compared to human-crafted prompts. Additionally, it maintains a 36.6% ASR on unseen tasks, showcasing strong cross-model applicability.

Conclusion: Semantic activation patterns play a pivotal role in transferable vulnerabilities across different models. The framework introduces a robust, gradient-free black-box attack method with high transferability and effectiveness.

Abstract: Direct Prompt Injection (DPI) attacks pose a critical security threat to
Large Language Models (LLMs) due to their low barrier of execution and high
potential damage. To address the impracticality of existing white-box/gray-box
methods and the poor transferability of black-box methods, we propose an
activations-guided prompt injection attack framework. We first construct an
Energy-based Model (EBM) using activations from a surrogate model to evaluate
the quality of adversarial prompts. Guided by the trained EBM, we employ the
token-level Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to adaptively optimize
adversarial prompts, thereby enabling gradient-free black-box attacks.
Experimental results demonstrate our superior cross-model transferability,
achieving 49.6% attack success rate (ASR) across five mainstream LLMs and 34.6%
improvement over human-crafted prompts, and maintaining 36.6% ASR on unseen
task scenarios. Interpretability analysis reveals a correlation between
activations and attack effectiveness, highlighting the critical role of
semantic patterns in transferable vulnerability exploitation.

*Sascha Kaltenpoth,Oliver Müller*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes LLM ATLAS, a conceptual framework based on agency theory, to address AI alignment problems during organizational adoption of large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Organizations face challenges adopting LLMs due to their potential to generate harmful or off-topic content, compounded by the black-box nature of LLMs and information asymmetries.

Method: The authors conduct a conceptual literature analysis grounded in agency theory, mapped onto organizational LLM adoption phases.

Result: The study introduces an extended process for analyzing AI alignment methods during LLM adoption and offers a preliminary LLM alignment problem-solution space.

Conclusion: The LLM ATLAS framework helps mitigate alignment issues in organizational settings, bridging gaps in existing research and fostering safer, more effective adoption of LLMs.

Abstract: Adopting Large language models (LLMs) in organizations potentially
revolutionizes our lives and work. However, they can generate off-topic,
discriminating, or harmful content. This AI alignment problem often stems from
misspecifications during the LLM adoption, unnoticed by the principal due to
the LLM's black-box nature. While various research disciplines investigated AI
alignment, they neither address the information asymmetries between
organizational adopters and black-box LLM agents nor consider organizational AI
adoption processes. Therefore, we propose LLM ATLAS (LLM Agency Theory-Led
Alignment Strategy) a conceptual framework grounded in agency (contract)
theory, to mitigate alignment problems during organizational LLM adoption. We
conduct a conceptual literature analysis using the organizational LLM adoption
phases and the agency theory as concepts. Our approach results in (1) providing
an extended literature analysis process specific to AI alignment methods during
organizational LLM adoption and (2) providing a first LLM alignment
problem-solution space.

### [20] [DeepGraphLog for Layered Neurosymbolic AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07665)
*Adem Kikaj,Giuseppe Marra,Floris Geerts,Robin Manhaeve,Luc De Raedt*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeepGraphLog integrates graph neural networks with symbolic reasoning, allowing arbitrary layering of neural and symbolic components and overcoming limitations in current neurosymbolic AI frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neurosymbolic AI frameworks limit complex dependency modeling and struggle with irregular graph-structured data due to fixed neural-to-symbolic processing order.

Method: DeepGraphLog introduces Graph Neural Predicates to ProbLog, treating symbolic representations as graphs for processing by Graph Neural Networks and enabling multi-layer neural-symbolic reasoning.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate DeepGraphLog's ability to tackle tasks like planning, knowledge graph completion, and enhancing Graph Neural Network expressivity, showing improved handling of relational dependencies.

Conclusion: DeepGraphLog broadens neurosymbolic AI applicability to graph-structured domains, offering a more flexible and expressive integration framework for neural and symbolic reasoning.

Abstract: Neurosymbolic AI (NeSy) aims to integrate the statistical strengths of neural
networks with the interpretability and structure of symbolic reasoning.
However, current NeSy frameworks like DeepProbLog enforce a fixed flow where
symbolic reasoning always follows neural processing. This restricts their
ability to model complex dependencies, especially in irregular data structures
such as graphs. In this work, we introduce DeepGraphLog, a novel NeSy framework
that extends ProbLog with Graph Neural Predicates. DeepGraphLog enables
multi-layer neural-symbolic reasoning, allowing neural and symbolic components
to be layered in arbitrary order. In contrast to DeepProbLog, which cannot
handle symbolic reasoning via neural methods, DeepGraphLog treats symbolic
representations as graphs, enabling them to be processed by Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs). We showcase the capabilities of DeepGraphLog on tasks in
planning, knowledge graph completion with distant supervision, and GNN
expressivity. Our results demonstrate that DeepGraphLog effectively captures
complex relational dependencies, overcoming key limitations of existing NeSy
systems. By broadening the applicability of neurosymbolic AI to
graph-structured domains, DeepGraphLog offers a more expressive and flexible
framework for neural-symbolic integration.

*Jipeng Li,Zeyu Gao,Yubin Qi,Hande Dong,Weijian Chen,Qiang Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes the Feedback-Triggered Regeneration (FTR) framework to improve the accuracy of Large Language Models (LLMs) by combining user feedback with advanced decoding methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of LLMs generating incorrect content during inference and the limitations of current self-correction methods in error localization and reasoning depth.

Method: The proposed FTR framework regenerates outputs based on negative user feedback and introduces Long-Term Multipath (LTM) decoding for exploring multiple reasoning trajectories beyond token-based myopic decisions.

Result: The framework demonstrated consistent and significant performance improvements in mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The FTR approach effectively enhances the reliability and reasoning capabilities of LLMs by leveraging user feedback and advanced decoding strategies.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across
diverse tasks, yet their susceptibility to generating incorrect content during
inference remains a critical unsolved challenge. While self-correction methods
offer potential solutions, their effectiveness is hindered by two inherent
limitations: (1) the absence of reliable guidance signals for error
localization, and (2) the restricted reasoning depth imposed by conventional
next-token decoding paradigms. To address these issues, we propose
Feedback-Triggered Regeneration (FTR), a novel framework that synergizes user
feedback with enhanced decoding dynamics. Specifically, FTR activates response
regeneration only upon receiving negative user feedback, thereby circumventing
error propagation from faulty self-assessment while preserving originally
correct outputs. Furthermore, we introduce Long-Term Multipath (LTM) decoding,
which enables systematic exploration of multiple reasoning trajectories through
delayed sequence evaluation, effectively overcoming the myopic decision-making
characteristic of standard next-token prediction. Extensive experiments on
mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks demonstrate that our
framework achieves consistent and significant improvements over
state-of-the-art prompt-based self-correction methods.

Method: Propose a system, FHIR-RAG-MEDS, combining RAG and HL7 FHIR standards to align clinical decision-making with evidence-based guidelines.

Result: The integration of RAG and HL7 FHIR enhances the efficiency and personalization of medical decision support processes.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the potential of combining advanced technologies like RAG and HL7 FHIR in improving evidence-based clinical decision-making but notes that further practical research is required.

Abstract: In this study, we propose FHIR-RAG-MEDS system that aims to integrate Health
Level 7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (HL7 FHIR) with a
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based system to improve personalized
medical decision support on evidence-based clinical guidelines, emphasizing the
need for research in practical applications. In the evolving landscape of
medical decision support systems, integrating advanced technologies such as RAG

*Ziye Chen,Chengwei Qin,Yao Shu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RIMO is a new math benchmark for LLMs, featuring revised problems to ensure evaluation clarity and fairness. Current LLMs struggle with its Olympiad-level difficulty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Olympiad-level benchmarks suffer from practical issues like grading noise, heterogeneous answer formats, and reliance on flawed solutions.

Method: RIMO consists of two tracks: RIMO-N (335 integer-answer problems) for deterministic grading and RIMO-P (456 proof problems with expert-checked solutions) for step-by-step reasoning assessment using automated grading.

Result: Ten leading LLMs, including GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Flash, show significant performance drops on RIMO compared to older benchmarks, exposing the gap in their reasoning abilities.

Conclusion: RIMO presents a rigorous yet evaluation-friendly tool for progress in LLM reasoning capabilities, indicating how far LLMs remain from true Olympiad-level reasoning.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) reach high scores on established mathematical
benchmarks, such as GSM8K and MATH, the research community has turned to
International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) problems to push the evaluation
frontier. However, existing Olympiad-level benchmarks suffer from practical
constraints that introduce grading noise and potential bias, such as
heterogeneous answer formats requiring model-based judges and a reliance on
potentially flawed solutions. We introduce RIMO, a two-track benchmark designed
to preserve peak Olympiad difficulty while eliminating this evaluation noise.
The first track, RIMO-N, rewrites 335 IMO problems to admit a single, unique
integer answer, allowing for deterministic correctness checking. The second
track, RIMO-P, features 456 proof problems with expert-checked solutions, which
are decomposed into a sequence of sub-problems to evaluate the step-by-step
reasoning process via an automated grading system. Our benchmarking of ten
frontier LLMs, including GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Flash, reveals that while these
systems excel on older benchmarks, their performance drops sharply on RIMO.
These results highlight a substantial gap between current LLM capabilities and
actual Olympiad-level reasoning. By providing a challenging yet
easy-to-evaluate suite, RIMO offers a high-resolution yardstick for future
research, presenting a clear target for closing the profound reasoning gap our
findings expose.

*Bo Yu,Zhixiu Hua,Bo Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study introduces BDPM, a machine learning method for analyzing gut microbiota to classify Parkinson's Disease, utilizing enhanced feature extraction and hybrid classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diagnostic methods for Parkinson's Disease are prone to misdiagnosis and fail to leverage gut microbiota data effectively as a biomarker.

Method: BDPM was developed using gut microbiota profiles from Parkinson’s patients and healthy individuals. It uses RFRE for feature selection and a hybrid model to analyze temporal and spatial microbiome patterns.

Result: BDPM offers robust feature extraction and classification capabilities tailored for microbiome data, improving diagnostic potential.

Conclusion: BDPM demonstrates promise in improving early and accurate classification of Parkinson’s disease through gut microbiota analysis.

Abstract: Background: Parkinson's disease remains a major neurodegenerative disorder
with high misdiagnosis rates, primarily due to reliance on clinical rating
scales. Recent studies have demonstrated a strong association between gut
microbiota and Parkinson's disease, suggesting that microbial composition may
serve as a promising biomarker. Although deep learning models based ongut
microbiota show potential for early prediction, most approaches rely on single
classifiers and often overlook inter-strain correlations or temporal dynamics.
Therefore, there is an urgent need for more robust feature extraction methods
tailored to microbiome data. Methods: We proposed BDPM (A Machine
Learning-Based Feature Extractor for Parkinson's Disease Classification via Gut
Microbiota Analysis). First, we collected gut microbiota profiles from 39
Parkinson's patients and their healthy spouses to identify differentially
abundant taxa. Second, we developed an innovative feature selection framework
named RFRE (Random Forest combined with Recursive Feature Elimination),
integrating ecological knowledge to enhance biological interpretability.
Finally, we designed a hybrid classification model to capture temporal and
spatial patterns in microbiome data.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper develops an AI-driven tool using life cycle assessment (LCA) to estimate the carbon footprints of food products, integrating a chatbot for user interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need for accessible tools to quantify environmental impacts, specifically carbon footprints, amid complex supply chains and fragmented data.

Method: A methodology combining advanced LCA techniques with knowledge-augmented AI technologies, such as retrieval-augmented generation, paired with a chatbot interface for user engagement.

Result: The result is a live web-based proof-of-concept system capable of estimating cradle-to-gate carbon footprints for various food products and meals.

Conclusion: The system showcases the promise of translation of LCA insights into user-friendly formats but acknowledges challenges like database inconsistencies and AI errors.

Abstract: Environmental sustainability, particularly in relation to climate change, is
a key concern for consumers, producers, and policymakers. The carbon footprint,
based on greenhouse gas emissions, is a standard metric for quantifying the
contribution to climate change of activities and is often assessed using life
cycle assessment (LCA). However, conducting LCA is complex due to opaque and
global supply chains, as well as fragmented data. This paper presents a
methodology that combines advances in LCA and publicly available databases with
knowledge-augmented AI techniques, including retrieval-augmented generation, to
estimate cradle-to-gate carbon footprints of food products. We introduce a
chatbot interface that allows users to interactively explore the carbon impact
of composite meals and relate the results to familiar activities. A live web
demonstration showcases our proof-of-concept system with arbitrary food items
and follow-up questions, highlighting both the potential and limitations - such
as database uncertainties and AI misinterpretations - of delivering LCA
insights in an accessible format.

*João Paulo Nogueira,Wentao Sun,Alonso Silva,Laith Zumot*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Certainty-Guided Reasoning (CGR) introduces a mechanism for large reasoning language models (LRLMs) to adaptively balance efficiency and accuracy based on confidence thresholds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large reasoning language models are constrained by token budgets, and improving efficiency while maintaining accuracy is critical for their practical deployment.

Method: The paper proposes CGR, a system wherein a critic model evaluates intermediate reasoning results and adjusts the reasoning process to either stop early with confidence or continue when certainty is lacking.

Result: Experiments show CGR improves accuracy, reduces token usage, decreases variability across multi-seed evaluations, and optimizes performance under penalty-based grading systems.

Conclusion: CGR makes language models more efficient, stable, and trustworthy, demonstrating its importance for resource-sensitive applications requiring high reliability.

Abstract: The rise of large reasoning language models (LRLMs) has unlocked new
potential for solving complex tasks. These models operate with a thinking
budget, that is, a predefined number of reasoning tokens used to arrive at a
solution. We propose a novel approach, inspired by the generator/discriminator
framework in generative adversarial networks, in which a critic model
periodically probes its own reasoning to assess whether it has reached a
confident conclusion. If not, reasoning continues until a target certainty
threshold is met. This mechanism adaptively balances efficiency and reliability
by allowing early termination when confidence is high, while encouraging
further reasoning when uncertainty persists. Through experiments on the
AIME2024 and AIME2025 datasets, we show that Certainty-Guided Reasoning (CGR)
improves baseline accuracy while reducing token usage. Importantly, extended
multi-seed evaluations over 64 runs demonstrate that CGR is stable, reducing
variance across seeds and improving exam-like performance under penalty-based
grading. Additionally, our token savings analysis shows that CGR can eliminate
millions of tokens in aggregate, with tunable trade-offs between certainty
thresholds and efficiency. Together, these findings highlight certainty as a
powerful signal for reasoning sufficiency. By integrating confidence into the
reasoning process, CGR makes large reasoning language models more adaptive,
trustworthy, and resource efficient, paving the way for practical deployment in
domains where both accuracy and computational cost matter.

*Amay Jain,Liu Cui,Si Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper compares vector-based and graph-based retrieval methods for improving language models in classrooms, focusing on reliability and pedagogical utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models like ChatGPT sometimes provide unreliable information in educational settings. The study explores methods to enhance their reliability for classroom question answering.

Method: Researchers evaluated two retrieval methods, vector-based and graph-based, using a dataset of 3,176 academic questions and altered textbooks to assess performance across question types and disciplines.

Result: Vector-based RAG performed well for quick fact retrieval and as a low-cost solution. GraphRAG Global was better for thematic answers, while GraphRAG Local excelled in accuracy with dense materials.

Conclusion: The study suggests using a dynamic framework to optimize query routing for cost-effective and pedagogically rich responses in classrooms, providing actionable insights for educators.

Abstract: Large language models like ChatGPT are increasingly used in classrooms, but
they often provide outdated or fabricated information that can mislead
students. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) improves reliability of LLMs by
grounding responses in external resources. We investigate two accessible RAG
paradigms, vector-based retrieval and graph-based retrieval to identify best
practices for classroom question answering (QA). Existing comparative studies
fail to account for pedagogical factors such as educational disciplines,
question types, and practical deployment costs. Using a novel dataset,
EduScopeQA, of 3,176 questions across academic subjects, we measure performance
on various educational query types, from specific facts to broad thematic
discussions. We also evaluate system alignment with a dataset of systematically
altered textbooks that contradict the LLM's latent knowledge. We find that
OpenAI Vector Search RAG (representing vector-based RAG) performs well as a
low-cost generalist, especially for quick fact retrieval. On the other hand,
GraphRAG Global excels at providing pedagogically rich answers to thematic
queries, and GraphRAG Local achieves the highest accuracy with the dense,
altered textbooks when corpus integrity is critical. Accounting for the 10-20x
higher resource usage of GraphRAG (representing graph-based RAG), we show that
a dynamic branching framework that routes queries to the optimal retrieval
method boosts fidelity and efficiency. These insights provide actionable
guidelines for educators and system designers to integrate RAG-augmented LLMs
into learning environments effectively.

*Xinyu Zhang,Changzhi Zhou,Linmei Hu,Luhao Zhang,Xiancai Chen,Haomin Fu,Yang Yang,Mengdi Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores using small-scale open-source language models to synthesize quality code instruction data, reducing reliance on proprietary models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce reliance on costly proprietary LLMs by enhancing small-scale open-source models for code instruction data synthesis.

Method: Iterative self-distillation approach with multi-checkpoint sampling, multi-aspect scoring, and gradient-based influence estimation for data filtering.

Result: SCoder models achieve state-of-the-art code generation capabilities, proving the proposed method's effectiveness.

Conclusion: Small-scale models can be bootstrapped into high-quality synthesizers, lowering costs and dependency on proprietary LLMs while achieving top-tier code generation.

Abstract: Existing code large language models (LLMs) often rely on large-scale
instruction data distilled from proprietary LLMs for fine-tuning, which
typically incurs high costs. In this paper, we explore the potential of
small-scale open-source LLMs (e.g., 7B) as synthesizers for high-quality code
instruction data construction. We first observe that the data synthesis
capability of small-scale LLMs can be enhanced by training on a few superior
data synthesis samples from proprietary LLMs. Building on this, we propose a
novel iterative self-distillation approach to bootstrap small-scale LLMs,
transforming them into powerful synthesizers that reduce reliance on
proprietary LLMs and minimize costs. Concretely, in each iteration, to obtain
diverse and high-quality self-distilled data, we design multi-checkpoint
sampling and multi-aspect scoring strategies for initial data selection.
Furthermore, to identify the most influential samples, we introduce a
gradient-based influence estimation method for final data filtering. Based on
the code instruction datasets from the small-scale synthesizers, we develop
SCoder, a family of code generation models fine-tuned from DeepSeek-Coder.
SCoder models achieve state-of-the-art code generation capabilities,

### [29] [CP-Model-Zoo: A Natural Language Query System for Constraint Programming Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07867)
*Augustin Crespin,Ioannis Kostis,Hélène Verhaeghe,Pierre Schaus*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A system called CP-Model-Zoo matches natural language problem descriptions to expert models, assisting non-experts in using Constraint Programming.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Constraint Programming has powerful modeling capabilities, which are often inaccessible to non-experts due to the complexity of languages and modeling expertise required.

Method: CP-Model-Zoo uses a database of expert-written models and retrieves the closest match based on the user's natural language problem description without requiring labeled data.

Result: Experiments showed high accuracy in matching user descriptions to appropriate models, across varying levels of expertise.

Conclusion: CP-Model-Zoo bridges the expertise gap in Constraint Programming by simplifying access to validated models, making the practice more approachable for non-experts.

Abstract: Constraint Programming and its high-level modeling languages have long been
recognized for their potential to achieve the holy grail of problem-solving.
However, the complexity of modeling languages, the large number of global
constraints, and the art of creating good models have often hindered
non-experts from choosing CP to solve their combinatorial problems. While
generating an expert-level model from a natural-language description of a
problem would be the dream, we are not yet there. We propose a tutoring system
called CP-Model-Zoo, exploiting expert-written models accumulated through the
years. CP-Model-Zoo retrieves the closest source code model from a database
based on a user's natural language description of a combinatorial problem. It
ensures that expert-validated models are presented to the user while
eliminating the need for human data labeling. Our experiments show excellent
accuracy in retrieving the correct model based on a user-input description of a
problem simulated with different levels of expertise.

### [30] [HiPhO: How Far Are (M)LLMs from Humans in the Latest High School Physics Olympiad Benchmark?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07894)

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces HiPhO, a physics benchmark based on high school physics Olympiads which evaluates AI models' performance aligned with human standards and highlights their capabilities and limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation was to address the lack of benchmarks that systematically cover real-world physics competitions and enable direct comparison of AI models' capabilities with human performance.

Method: The authors compiled recent physics Olympiad exams (2024-2025), adopted professional grading schemes for fine-grained evaluations, and introduced medal-based performance comparisons for AI models and humans.

Result: Their evaluation of 30 models revealed open-source models generally scoring at or below bronze level, closed-source reasoning models reaching higher performance with some gold medals, and an overall gap between AI and top human physics students.

Conclusion: HiPhO establishes a rigorous, human-aligned benchmark for multimodal physical reasoning, showing the relative strength of closed-source models but highlighting the need for progress in AI's physics reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Recently, the physical capabilities of (M)LLMs have garnered increasing
attention. However, existing benchmarks for physics suffer from two major gaps:
they neither provide systematic and up-to-date coverage of real-world physics
competitions such as physics Olympiads, nor enable direct performance
comparison with humans. To bridge these gaps, we present HiPhO, the first
benchmark dedicated to high school physics Olympiads with human-aligned
evaluation. Specifically, HiPhO highlights three key innovations. (1)
Comprehensive Data: It compiles 13 latest Olympiad exams from 2024-2025,
spanning both international and regional competitions, and covering mixed
modalities that encompass problems spanning text-only to diagram-based. (2)
Professional Evaluation: We adopt official marking schemes to perform
fine-grained grading at both the answer and step level, fully aligned with
human examiners to ensure high-quality and domain-specific evaluation. (3)
Comparison with Human Contestants: We assign gold, silver, and bronze medals to
models based on official medal thresholds, thereby enabling direct comparison
between (M)LLMs and human contestants. Our large-scale evaluation of 30
state-of-the-art (M)LLMs shows that: across 13 exams, open-source MLLMs mostly
remain at or below the bronze level; open-source LLMs show promising progress
with occasional golds; closed-source reasoning MLLMs can achieve 6 to 12 gold
medals; and most models still have a significant gap from full marks. These
results highlight a substantial performance gap between open-source models and
top students, the strong physical reasoning capabilities of closed-source
reasoning models, and the fact that there is still significant room for
improvement. HiPhO, as a rigorous, human-aligned, and Olympiad-focused
benchmark for advancing multimodal physical reasoning, is open-source and
available at https://github.com/SciYu/HiPhO.

### [31] [Probing the Preferences of a Language Model: Integrating Verbal and Behavioral Tests of AI Welfare](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07961)
*Valen Tagliabue,Leonard Dung*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores ways to measure welfare in language models by comparing their verbal expressions, behavioral preferences, and responses to welfare scales. It finds notable correlations but acknowledges uncertainties and invites further exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop tools and paradigms for assessing welfare in AI systems, specifically language models, and understand if measuring welfare states in these systems is feasible.

Method: The study employed experiments where language models expressed preferences verbally and behaviorally while navigating virtual environments, choosing conversation topics, and responding to welfare scales with semantically equivalent prompts.

Result: The experiments showed a notable correlation between stated preferences and behavioral measures of welfare, but responses varied across models and conditions, and consistency among measurements was limited.

Conclusion: Though there’s potential for measuring welfare in language models via preference satisfaction as a proxy, current methods are inconclusive due to inconsistencies and uncertainties. The paper advocates for continued research on the topic.

Abstract: We develop new experimental paradigms for measuring welfare in language
models. We compare verbal reports of models about their preferences with
preferences expressed through behavior when navigating a virtual environment
and selecting conversation topics. We also test how costs and rewards affect
behavior and whether responses to an eudaimonic welfare scale - measuring
states such as autonomy and purpose in life - are consistent across
semantically equivalent prompts. Overall, we observed a notable degree of
mutual support between our measures. The reliable correlations observed between
stated preferences and behavior across conditions suggest that preference
satisfaction can, in principle, serve as an empirically measurable welfare
proxy in some of today's AI systems. Furthermore, our design offered an
illuminating setting for qualitative observation of model behavior. Yet, the
consistency between measures was more pronounced in some models and conditions
than others and responses were not consistent across perturbations. Due to
this, and the background uncertainty about the nature of welfare and the
cognitive states (and welfare subjecthood) of language models, we are currently
uncertain whether our methods successfully measure the welfare state of
language models. Nevertheless, these findings highlight the feasibility of
welfare measurement in language models, inviting further exploration.

### [32] [VISION: Robust and Interpretable Code Vulnerability Detection Leveraging Counterfactual Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18933)
*David Egea,Barproda Halder,Sanghamitra Dutta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces VISION, a framework addressing limitations of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in detecting vulnerabilities through counterfactual training and interpretability mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve automated vulnerability detection in source code using GNNs, particularly addressing issues like training data imbalance, label noise, and lack of generalization in real-world applications.

Method: The method involves generating counterfactual examples via a Large Language Model (LLM), targeted GNN training with paired code examples having opposite labels, and applying graph-based interpretability techniques to focus on relevant code statements.

Result: VISION achieves significant improvements in detection metrics, including overall accuracy (97.8% vs. 51.8%), pairwise contrast accuracy (95.8% vs. 4.5%), and worst-group accuracy (85.5% vs. 0.7%). It offers new interpretability metrics and provides a benchmark dataset (CWE-20-CFA) of 27,556 functions.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enables robust, generalizable, and transparent vulnerability detection, facilitating trustworthy AI-based cybersecurity systems and interactive human-in-the-loop analysis.

Abstract: Automated detection of vulnerabilities in source code is an essential
cybersecurity challenge, underpinning trust in digital systems and services.
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach as they can
learn structural and logical code relationships in a data-driven manner.
However, their performance is severely constrained by training data imbalances
and label noise. GNNs often learn 'spurious' correlations from superficial code
similarities, producing detectors that fail to generalize well to unseen
real-world data. In this work, we propose a unified framework for robust and
interpretable vulnerability detection, called VISION, to mitigate spurious
correlations by systematically augmenting a counterfactual training dataset.
Counterfactuals are samples with minimal semantic modifications but opposite
labels. Our framework includes: (i) generating counterfactuals by prompting a
Large Language Model (LLM); (ii) targeted GNN training on paired code examples
with opposite labels; and (iii) graph-based interpretability to identify the
crucial code statements relevant for vulnerability predictions while ignoring
spurious ones. We find that VISION reduces spurious learning and enables more
robust, generalizable detection, improving overall accuracy (from 51.8% to
97.8%), pairwise contrast accuracy (from 4.5% to 95.8%), and worst-group
accuracy (from 0.7% to 85.5%) on the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)-20
vulnerability. We further demonstrate gains using proposed metrics: intra-class
attribution variance, inter-class attribution distance, and node score
dependency. We also release CWE-20-CFA, a benchmark of 27,556 functions (real
and counterfactual) from the high-impact CWE-20 category. Finally, VISION
advances transparent and trustworthy AI-based cybersecurity systems through
interactive visualization for human-in-the-loop analysis.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show increasing potential in education, yet
benchmarks for non-English languages in specialized domains remain scarce. We
introduce MedBench-IT, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs on
Italian medical university entrance examinations. Sourced from Edizioni Simone,
a leading preparatory materials publisher, MedBench-IT comprises 17,410
expert-written multiple-choice questions across six subjects (Biology,
Chemistry, Logic, General Culture, Mathematics, Physics) and three difficulty
levels. We evaluated diverse models including proprietary LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude
series) and resource-efficient open-source alternatives (<30B parameters)
focusing on practical deployability.
  Beyond accuracy, we conducted rigorous reproducibility tests (88.86% response
consistency, varying by subject), ordering bias analysis (minimal impact), and
reasoning prompt evaluation. We also examined correlations between question
readability and model performance, finding a statistically significant but
small inverse relationship. MedBench-IT provides a crucial resource for Italian
NLP community, EdTech developers, and practitioners, offering insights into
current capabilities and standardized evaluation methodology for this critical
domain.

TL;DR: The Interspeech 2025 ML-SUPERB 2.0 Challenge introduces a large multilingual test suite and an online evaluation server to assess and advance multilingual ASR models across diverse languages and dialects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multilingual ASR advancements have not been evenly distributed among languages and variants, requiring efforts to make speech models more inclusive and accurate.

Method: The challenge includes the creation of a diverse test suite with data from over 200 languages, and provides an online evaluation server for flexible model design.

Result: Five submissions from three teams surpassed baseline performance, achieving up to 23% improvement in language identification accuracy and up to 30.2% reduction in CER for accented and dialectal speech.

Conclusion: Community-driven challenges such as this are vital for enhancing inclusivity and performance in multilingual speech technology.

Abstract: Recent improvements in multilingual ASR have not been equally distributed
across languages and language varieties. To advance state-of-the-art (SOTA) ASR
models, we present the Interspeech 2025 ML-SUPERB 2.0 Challenge. We construct a
new test suite that consists of data from 200+ languages, accents, and dialects

### [36] [Toward Purpose-oriented Topic Model Evaluation enabled by Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07142)
*Zhiyin Tan,Jennifer D'Souza*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an LLM-based evaluation framework for dynamically evolving topic models, addressing limitations of traditional metrics by emphasizing semantic robustness and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve the evaluation of topic models for digital libraries by mitigating semantic and structural weaknesses overlooked by traditional metrics.

Method: Develop a purpose-driven framework with nine LLM-based metrics covering lexical, semantic, structural, and alignment dimensions of topic quality, validated through diverse protocols and datasets.

Result: LLM-based metrics demonstrated task-relevance and highlighted flaws like redundancy and semantic drift in topic models, better than conventional metrics.

Conclusion: LLMs offer robust and interpretable tools for dynamic topic modeling evaluation, enhancing adaptability in evolving datasets.

Abstract: This study presents a framework for automated evaluation of dynamically
evolving topic models using Large Language Models (LLMs). Topic modeling is
essential for organizing and retrieving scholarly content in digital library
systems, helping users navigate complex and evolving knowledge domains.
However, widely used automated metrics, such as coherence and diversity, often
capture only narrow statistical patterns and fail to explain semantic failures
in practice. We introduce a purpose-oriented evaluation framework that employs
nine LLM-based metrics spanning four key dimensions of topic quality: lexical
validity, intra-topic semantic soundness, inter-topic structural soundness, and
document-topic alignment soundness. The framework is validated through
adversarial and sampling-based protocols, and is applied across datasets
spanning news articles, scholarly publications, and social media posts, as well
as multiple topic modeling methods and open-source LLMs. Our analysis shows
that LLM-based metrics provide interpretable, robust, and task-relevant
assessments, uncovering critical weaknesses in topic models such as redundancy
and semantic drift, which are often missed by traditional metrics. These
results support the development of scalable, fine-grained evaluation tools for
maintaining topic relevance in dynamic datasets. All code and data supporting

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models perform well across general domains but lack effectiveness in specialized fields like energy, requiring technical expertise and precise knowledge.

Method: The authors fine-tuned the LLaMA 3.1-8B model using Supervised Fine-Tuning on a curated energy-related text corpus, detailing data collection, model fine-tuning, benchmarking, evaluation, and deployment.

Result: EnergyGPT outperforms the base LLaMA model in domain-specific tasks related to energy, as demonstrated through benchmarking.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning general-purpose LLMs with specialized corpora enables improvements in performance for specific domains without requiring extensive computational infrastructure.

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated impressive capabilities across
various domains. However, their general-purpose nature often limits their
effectiveness in specialized fields such as energy, where deep technical
expertise and precise domain knowledge are essential. In this paper, we
introduce EnergyGPT, a domain-specialized language model tailored for the
energy sector, developed by fine-tuning LLaMA 3.1-8B model using Supervised
Fine-Tuning on a high-quality, curated corpus of energy-related texts. We
present a complete development pipeline, including data collection and
curation, model fine-tuning, benchmark design and LLM-judge choice, evaluation
and deployment. Through this work, we demonstrate that our training strategy
enables improvements in domain relevance and performance without the need for
large-scale infrastructure. By evaluating the performance of the model using
domain-specific question-answering benchmarks, our results demonstrate that
EnergyGPT outperforms the base model in most of the energy-related language
understanding and generation tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DischargeSim, a benchmark evaluating large language models (LLMs) in personalized post-visit patient education through simulated dialogues and assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the gap in evaluating LLMs' ability to support patients after medical visits, focusing instead on discharge communication and education as opposed to diagnostic reasoning.

Method: DischargeSim employs simulated multi-turn conversations between LLM-driven DoctorAgents and PatientAgents with varying psychosocial profiles. It evaluates dialogue quality, personalized document creation, and patient comprehension.

Result: Experiments across 18 LLMs showed performance differences in discharge education, with model size not always correlating with better results. Diverse patient profiles exposed significant gaps in LLM capabilities.

Conclusion: DischargeSim establishes a foundation for assessing LLMs in post-visit clinical education, pushing for personalized and equitable patient support through benchmarking.

Abstract: Discharge communication is a critical yet underexplored component of patient
care, where the goal shifts from diagnosis to education. While recent large
language model (LLM) benchmarks emphasize in-visit diagnostic reasoning, they
fail to evaluate models' ability to support patients after the visit. We
introduce DischargeSim, a novel benchmark that evaluates LLMs on their ability
to act as personalized discharge educators. DischargeSim simulates post-visit,
multi-turn conversations between LLM-driven DoctorAgents and PatientAgents with
diverse psychosocial profiles (e.g., health literacy, education, emotion).
Interactions are structured across six clinically grounded discharge topics and
assessed along three axes: (1) dialogue quality via automatic and LLM-as-judge
evaluation, (2) personalized document generation including free-text summaries
and structured AHRQ checklists, and (3) patient comprehension through a
downstream multiple-choice exam. Experiments across 18 LLMs reveal significant
gaps in discharge education capability, with performance varying widely across
patient profiles. Notably, model size does not always yield better education
outcomes, highlighting trade-offs in strategy use and content prioritization.
DischargeSim offers a first step toward benchmarking LLMs in post-visit
clinical education and promoting equitable, personalized patient support.

### [39] [Rule-Based Moral Principles for Explaining Uncertainty in Natural Language Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07190)
*Zahra Atf,Peter R Lewis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a rule-based framework leveraging moral principles for handling uncertainty in text generated by large language models, aiming for transparency and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing application of LLMs in high-stakes environments necessitates tools that manage uncertainty in a socially responsible and transparent way.

Method: The authors propose using rules derived from moral psychology and virtue ethics (e.g., precaution, deference, responsibility) encoded in a Prolog system, where responses to varying uncertainty levels are matched with plain-language explanations.

Result: Simulations demonstrate improvements in rule coverage, fairness, and trust calibration. Applications in clinical and legal contexts show the potential of aligning LLM behavior with ethical principles.

Conclusion: The framework provides a transparent and ethical alternative to probabilistic models, enhancing trust and interpretability for socially responsible LLM applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in high-stakes settings,
where explaining uncertainty is both technical and ethical. Probabilistic
methods are often opaque and misaligned with expectations of transparency. We
propose a framework based on rule-based moral principles for handling
uncertainty in LLM-generated text. Using insights from moral psychology and
virtue ethics, we define rules such as precaution, deference, and
responsibility to guide responses under epistemic or aleatoric uncertainty.
These rules are encoded in a lightweight Prolog engine, where uncertainty
levels (low, medium, high) trigger aligned system actions with plain-language
rationales. Scenario-based simulations benchmark rule coverage, fairness, and
trust calibration. Use cases in clinical and legal domains illustrate how moral
reasoning can improve trust and interpretability. Our approach offers a
transparent, lightweight alternative to probabilistic models for socially
responsible natural language generation.

*Aida Kostikova,Ole Pütz,Steffen Eger,Olga Sabelfeld,Benjamin Paassen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the use of large language models (LLMs) to analyze (anti-)solidarity sentiments in German parliamentary debates, uncovering historical trends and assessing LLMs' capabilities for automated annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of extensive manual annotation when analyzing political speech about migration, a topic of critical importance in German history and contemporary debate.

Method: The study involves the evaluation of multiple LLMs against a dataset of thousands of human annotations. The analysis considers factors like model size, fine-tuning, and temporal data relevance, alongside identifying systematic errors.

Result: The paper finds that LLMs effectively capture trends in (anti-)solidarity sentiments, and historical data shows high migrant solidarity post-WWII, contrasting with rising anti-solidarity in parliamentary debates since 2015.

Conclusion: LLMs hold promise for automating complex political text analyses, offering insights into societal trends while highlighting the continuous challenge of migration debates in Germany's polarized environment.

Abstract: Migration has been a core topic in German political debate, from millions of
expellees post World War II over labor migration to refugee movements in the
recent past. Studying political speech regarding such wide-ranging phenomena in
depth traditionally required extensive manual annotations, limiting the scope
of analysis to small subsets of the data. Large language models (LLMs) have the
potential to partially automate even complex annotation tasks. We provide an
extensive evaluation of a multiple LLMs in annotating (anti-)solidarity
subtypes in German parliamentary debates compared to a large set of thousands
of human reference annotations (gathered over a year). We evaluate the
influence of model size, prompting differences, fine-tuning, historical versus
contemporary data; and we investigate systematic errors. Beyond methodological
evaluation, we also interpret the resulting annotations from a social science
lense, gaining deeper insight into (anti-)solidarity trends towards migrants in
the German post-World War II period and recent past. Our data reveals a high
degree of migrant-directed solidarity in the postwar period, as well as a
strong trend towards anti-solidarity in the German parliament since 2015,
motivating further research. These findings highlight the promise of LLMs for
political text analysis and the importance of migration debates in Germany,
where demographic decline and labor shortages coexist with rising polarization.

*Zhuoqing Song,Peng Sun,Huizhuo Yuan,Quanquan Gu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CASTLE, a causal attention mechanism that updates keys dynamically as context unfolds, improving language modeling and downstream task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance standard causal attention models by integrating information from subsequent tokens while maintaining autoregressive properties.

Method: Proposes CASTLE, which uses lookahead keys that update dynamically. Derives a mathematical equivalence for efficient parallel training.

Result: CASTLE reduces validation perplexity and achieves better performance in language modeling benchmarks and downstream tasks.

Conclusion: Dynamic key updates in causal attention mechanisms can enhance model effectiveness without sacrificing efficiency.

Abstract: In standard causal attention, each token's query, key, and value (QKV) are
static and encode only preceding context. We introduce CAuSal aTtention with
Lookahead kEys (CASTLE), an attention mechanism that continually updates each
token's keys as the context unfolds. We term these updated keys lookahead keys
because they belong to earlier positions yet integrate information from tokens
that appear later relative to those positions, while strictly preserving the
autoregressive property. Although the mechanism appears sequential, we derive a
mathematical equivalence that avoids explicitly materializing lookahead keys at
each position and enables efficient parallel training. On language modeling
benchmarks, CASTLE consistently outperforms standard causal attention across
model scales, reducing validation perplexity and improving performance on a
range of downstream tasks.

*David Oprea,Sam Powers*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new method, BVM, for judging state changes in images using language embeddings, tested on the MIT-States dataset. It performs well in noun state classification but shows inconclusive results for adjective differentiation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the methods for determining state changes in visual data using language embeddings, with an emphasis on better classification accuracy and understanding the potential of a new approach (BVM).

Method: The authors developed and tested the Basis Vectors Method (BVM) using the MIT-States dataset, comparing it against baseline metrics (cosine similarity, dot product, etc.) for noun state classification and against logistic regression for adjective differentiation.

Result: BVM outperformed all baseline methods for classifying noun states but failed to show superiority over logistic regression in differentiating adjectives. Evidence for methodological improvements was identified.

Conclusion: The BVM method shows promise in classifying noun states but requires refinement for adjective differentiation. Further development could enhance its accuracy and applicability.

Abstract: We test a new method, which we will abbreviate using the acronym BVM (Basis
Vectors Method), in its ability to judge the state changes in images through
using language embeddings. We used the MIT-States dataset, containing about
53,000 images, to gather all of our data, which has 225 nouns and 115
adjectives, with each noun having about 9 different adjectives, forming
approximately 1000 noun-adjective pairs. For our first experiment, we test our
method's ability to determine the state of each noun class separately against
other metrics for comparison. These metrics are cosine similarity, dot product,
product quantization, binary index, Naive Bayes, and a custom neural network.
Among these metrics, we found that our proposed BVM performs the best in
classifying the states for each noun. We then perform a second experiment where
we try using BVM to determine if it can differentiate adjectives from one
another for each adjective separately. We compared the abilities of BVM to
differentiate adjectives against the proposed method the MIT-States paper
suggests: using a logistic regression model. In the end, we did not find
conclusive evidence that our BVM metric could perform better than the logistic
regression model at discerning adjectives. Yet, we were able to find evidence
for possible improvements to our method; this leads to the chance of increasing
our method's accuracy through certain changes in our methodologies.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a benchmark to predict quality metrics for long-form generation tasks under various metrics, models, and tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for task-, model-, and metric-agnostic methods to predict continuous evaluation metric scores for long-form generation tasks.

Method: The benchmark predicts metric scores using black-box model inputs/outputs and uses 11 datasets, multiple LLMs, and baselines, requiring as few as 16 training examples.

Result: The methodology effectively predicts scores across tasks and handles uncertainty using prediction intervals.

Conclusion: The work introduces a new benchmark, offers baselines for adoption, and sets a foundation for further research in predicting instance-level long-form generation performance.

Abstract: We motivate and share a new benchmark for instance-level performance
prediction of long-form generation tasks having multi-faceted, fine-grained
quality metrics. Our task-, model- and metric-agnostic formulation predicts
continuous evaluation metric scores given only black-box model inputs and
outputs. Beyond predicting point estimates of metric scores, the benchmark also
requires inferring prediction intervals to quantify uncertainty around point
estimates. Evaluation spans 11 long-form datasets/tasks with multiple LLMs,
baselines, and metrics per task. We show that scores can be effectively
predicted across long-form generation tasks using as few as 16 training
examples. Overall, we introduce a novel and useful task, a valuable benchmark
to drive progress, and baselines ready for practical adoption today.

### [44] [Does This Look Familiar to You? Knowledge Analysis via Model Internal Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07311)
*Sihyun Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces KAMIR, a novel method that analyzes a model's internal representations to select effective training data, achieving better generalization performance across tasks like summarization and machine comprehension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is crucial for adapting large language models to specific tasks, but current methods for training data selection are inefficient, costly, and overly reliant on prompt engineering.

Method: The study introduces KAMIR, which uses similarities in the model's internal hidden states to evaluate and select useful training data, bypassing the need for prompt engineering and enabling broader applicability.

Result: KAMIR proved effective in experiments, showing that training with less familiar data enhances generalization across tasks and can work even with small datasets and simple architectures.

Conclusion: KAMIR is a novel and efficient data selection method that overcomes the limitations of traditional approaches, improving model performance and generalization without relying on prompt engineering.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have been driven by
pretraining, supervised fine tuning (SFT), and alignment tuning. Among these,
SFT plays a crucial role in transforming a model 's general knowledge into
structured responses tailored to specific tasks. However, there is no clearly
established methodology for effective training data selection. Simply
increasing the volume of data does not guarantee performance improvements,
while preprocessing, sampling, and validation require substantial time and
cost.
  To address this issue, a variety of data selection methods have been
proposed. Among them, knowledge based selection approaches identify suitable
training data by analyzing the model 's responses. Nevertheless, these methods
typically rely on prompt engineering, making them sensitive to variations and
incurring additional costs for prompt design.
  In this study, we propose Knowledge Analysis via Model Internal
Representations (KAMIR), a novel approach that overcomes these limitations by
analyzing data based on the model 's internal representations. KAMIR computes
similarities between the hidden states of each layer (block) and the final
hidden states for a given input to assess the data. Unlike prior methods that
were largely limited to multiple choice tasks, KAMIR can be applied to a wide
range of tasks such as machine reading comprehension and summarization.
Moreover, it selects data useful for training based on the model 's familiarity
with the input, even with a small dataset and a simple classifier architecture.
Experiments across diverse task datasets demonstrate that training with less
familiar data leads to better generalization performance.

*Nakyung Lee,Yeongoon Kim,Minhae Oh,Suhwan Kim,Jin Woo Koo,Hyewon Jo,Jungwoo Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes Self-Attention One-Step Belief Propagation (SAOBP) to enhance language models by addressing localization in self-attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Localization in self-attention leads to attentions collapsing onto limited tokens, failing to capture long-range dependencies in language models.

Method: SAOBP employs a belief propagation process to inject multi-hop relationships into self-attention mechanisms. It also introduces Global Token Dependency (GTD) to interpret multihop connections.

Result: The method prevents entropy collapse in deeper layers, maintains task-appropriate GTD levels, and improves model performance, especially in small-scale, resource-constrained setups.

Conclusion: SAOBP enhances inference quality and model robustness, demonstrating its potential for resource-efficient language model refinement.

Abstract: Transformer-based self-attention mechanism serves as the core of modern
language models, yet it often suffers from localization, where attentions
collapse onto a limited subset of tokens and fail to capture long-range
dependencies. To address this issue, we propose Self-Attention One-step Belief
Propagation (SAOBP), a refinement framework that injects multi-hop
relationships through a belief propagation process. To interpret and quantify
these interactions, we introduce Global Token Dependency (GTD) that captures
the relative contribution of multihop connections within the attention graph.
Empirical results indicate that SAOBP helps prevent entropy collapse in deeper
layers and adaptively maintains GTD at task-appropriate levels, thereby
supporting improvements in model performance. Importantly, we observe
competitive gains in small-scale models, highlighting its potential for
improving inference quality in resource-constrained scenarios.

*Yixuan Tang,Yi Yang,Ahmed Abbasi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PersonaFuse introduces an improved framework for Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling adaptation to various personalities and achieving enhanced social-emotional intelligence without compromising general reasoning or safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses LLMs' limitations in emotional perception and social competence during real-world interactions by aiming to enhance their ability to adapt communication styles to different contexts.

Method: PersonaFuse utilizes Trait Activation Theory and the Big Five personality model, combined with a Mixture-of-Expert architecture including persona adapters and a dynamic routing network to support contextual trait expression.

Result: Experimental evaluations show that PersonaFuse performs better than baseline models in social-emotional intelligence, improves human-centered applications like mental health counseling, and retains strong general reasoning ability.

Conclusion: PersonaFuse offers a promising and theoretically grounded solution for developing socially intelligent LLMs, marking progress towards more human-centric AI systems.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities across various fields. These developments have led to more direct
communication between humans and LLMs in various situations, such as social
companionship and psychological support. However, LLMs often exhibit
limitations in emotional perception and social competence during real-world
conversations. These limitations partly originate from their inability to adapt
their communication style and emotional expression to different social and task
contexts. In this work, we introduce PersonaFuse, a novel LLM post-training
framework that enables LLMs to adapt and express different personalities for
varying situations. Inspired by Trait Activation Theory and the Big Five
personality model, PersonaFuse employs a Mixture-of-Expert architecture that
combines persona adapters with a dynamic routing network, enabling contextual
trait expression. Experimental results show that PersonaFuse substantially
outperforms baseline models across multiple dimensions of social-emotional
intelligence. Importantly, these gains are achieved without sacrificing general
reasoning ability or model safety, which remain common limitations of direct
prompting and supervised fine-tuning approaches. PersonaFuse also delivers
consistent improvements in downstream human-centered applications, such as
mental health counseling and review-based customer service. Finally, human
preference evaluations against leading LLMs, including GPT-4o and DeepSeek,
demonstrate that PersonaFuse achieves competitive response quality despite its
comparatively smaller model size. These findings demonstrate that
PersonaFuse~offers a theoretically grounded and practical approach for
developing social-emotional enhanced LLMs, marking a significant advancement
toward more human-centric AI systems.

*Sankalp Tattwadarshi Swain,Anshika Krishnatray,Dhruv Kumar,Jagat Sesh Challa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates whether large language models (LLMs) can acquire language through interaction by creating a new experimental framework with a novel language, "Tinkatongue." LLMs failed to effectively learn the language but exhibited human-like learning strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address whether LLMs can acquire language akin to humans—via pattern recognition and interactive feedback—which is largely unexplored.

Method: The study introduces a novel language, "Tinkatongue," used in interactions between LLMs and a bot fluent only in Tinkatongue. The LLM agents are assessed on their ability to learn and engage conversationally.

Result: LLMs failed to establish coherent conversations within 100 responses but demonstrated human-like strategies in their attempts to learn.

Conclusion: Findings point to the need for new evaluation benchmarks and the potential for creating LLM models that learn more effectively from interactive feedback.

Abstract: Existing evaluation studies on linguistic competence of large language models
(LLM agents) have focused primarily on vocabulary learning, morphological rule
induction, syntactic generalization, pragmatic inference, and cross-linguistic
transfer. However, none assess whether LLM agents can acquire a language
through pattern recognition and interactive feedback, a central feature of
human language acquisition. We propose a novel experimental framework in which
an LLM agent is evaluated on its ability to acquire and use a newly constructed
language (Tinkatongue) in conversation with a bot that understands only
Tinkatongue. Our findings show that LLM agents fail to establish a conversation
within 100 responses, yet they adopt distinct strategies that mirror human
approaches to language learning. The results suggest a new direction for
evaluation benchmarks and open pathways to model designs that learn more
effectively from interactive feedback.

*Yi-Jie Cheng,Oscar Chew,Yun-Nung Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes lightweight exploration modules to enhance small language models (SLMs) in knowledge graph (KG)-based question answering, improving their traversal and reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for integrating KGs into reasoning often rely on large or proprietary language models, which restrict accessibility and scalability. Small language models (SLMs) face challenges in traversing and reasoning over KGs.

Method: The authors propose using simple and efficient exploration modules to handle knowledge graph traversal, rather than relying entirely on the capabilities of SLMs.

Result: Experiment results show that these lightweight modules significantly improve the performance of small language models in KG-based question answering tasks.

Conclusion: Efficient exploration modules can serve as a practical solution to enhance the efficacy of small language models in reasoning over knowledge graphs, offering accessible and scalable alternatives to larger proprietary models.

Abstract: Integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) into the reasoning processes of large
language models (LLMs) has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate
hallucination. However, existing work in this area often relies on proprietary
or extremely large models, limiting accessibility and scalability. In this
study, we investigate the capabilities of existing integration methods for
small language models (SLMs) in KG-based question answering and observe that
their performance is often constrained by their limited ability to traverse and
reason over knowledge graphs. To address this limitation, we propose leveraging
simple and efficient exploration modules to handle knowledge graph traversal in
place of the language model itself. Experiment results demonstrate that these
lightweight modules effectively improve the performance of small language
models on knowledge graph question answering tasks. Source code:

TL;DR: LongEmotion introduces a benchmark for Emotional Intelligence (EI) in long-context interactions, employing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Collaborative Emotional Modeling (CoEM) methods to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for Emotional Intelligence fail to address long-context and realistic settings that feature lengthy, diverse, and noisy interactions.

Method: LongEmotion provides tasks such as Emotion Classification, Detection, QA, Conversation, Summary, and Expression, averaging input lengths of 8,777 tokens. It uses RAG for retrieving context-internal information and CoEM to decompose and augment tasks.

Result: Experimental results show consistent improvement in EI performance with RAG and CoEM across most tasks, outperforming standard prompt-based approaches.

Conclusion: RAG and CoEM enhance long-context emotional intelligence tasks, making LLMs more applicable to realistic and practical scenarios.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) make significant progress in Emotional
Intelligence (EI) and long-context understanding. However, existing benchmarks
tend to overlook certain aspects of EI in long-context scenarios, especially
under realistic, practical settings where interactions are lengthy, diverse,
and often noisy. To move towards such realistic settings, we present
LongEmotion, a benchmark specifically designed for long-context EI tasks. It
covers a diverse set of tasks, including Emotion Classification, Emotion
Detection, Emotion QA, Emotion Conversation, Emotion Summary, and Emotion
Expression. On average, the input length for these tasks reaches 8,777 tokens,
with long-form generation required for Emotion Expression. To enhance
performance under realistic constraints, we incorporate Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) and Collaborative Emotional Modeling (CoEM), and compare them
with standard prompt-based methods. Unlike conventional approaches, our RAG
method leverages both the conversation context and the large language model
itself as retrieval sources, avoiding reliance on external knowledge bases. The
CoEM method further improves performance by decomposing the task into five
stages, integrating both retrieval augmentation and limited knowledge
injection. Experimental results show that both RAG and CoEM consistently
enhance EI-related performance across most long-context tasks, advancing LLMs
toward more practical and real-world EI applications. Furthermore, we conducted
a comparative case study experiment on the GPT series to demonstrate the
differences among various models in terms of EI. Code is available on GitHub at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores detecting positive online communication ('candy speech') using AI models, finding XLM-RoBERTa-Large to be most effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the lack of automated tools for detecting positive, supportive communication ('candy speech') in social media, which can foster online civility.

Method: The authors used a 46,000-comment German YouTube dataset and compared monolingual and multilingual language models, including GBERT and XLM-RoBERTa, with a focus on span-level candy speech detection.

Result: The XLM-RoBERTa-Large model achieved the highest performance, with an F1 score of 0.8906 for binary detection and 0.6307 for span-based detection, winning at GermEval 2025.

Conclusion: Multilingual models like XLM-RoBERTa-Large, especially with features like span-based training and emoji-aware tokenizers, are effective at identifying positive communication online.

Abstract: Positive, supportive online communication in social media (candy speech) has
the potential to foster civility, yet automated detection of such language
remains underexplored, limiting systematic analysis of its impact. We
investigate how candy speech can be reliably detected in a 46k-comment German
YouTube corpus by monolingual and multilingual language models, including
GBERT, Qwen3 Embedding, and XLM-RoBERTa. We find that a multilingual
XLM-RoBERTa-Large model trained to detect candy speech at the span level
outperforms other approaches, ranking first in both binary positive F1: 0.8906)
and categorized span-based detection (strict F1: 0.6307) subtasks at the
GermEval 2025 Shared Task on Candy Speech Detection. We speculate that
span-based training, multilingual capabilities, and emoji-aware tokenizers
improved detection performance. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of
multilingual models in identifying positive, supportive language.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study compares four existing stigmatizing language lexicons in healthcare and finds moderate similarity, many judgmental terms, and predominant negativity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address healthcare inequities caused by stigmatizing language and to identify the challenges in defining such language with a standardized lexicon.

Method: The researchers conducted a systematic literature search to identify stigmatizing language lexicons, then quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed their similarities and discrepancies, alongside a sentiment analysis.

Result: Four lexicons were identified, showing moderate semantic similarity and predominantly negative stigmatizing expressions, often tied to clinician judgment of perceived negative behavior.

Conclusion: There is a significant need for a standardized lexicon to address stigmatizing language, although challenges remain in its definition and creation.

Abstract: Stigmatizing language results in healthcare inequities, yet there is no
universally accepted or standardized lexicon defining which words, terms, or
phrases constitute stigmatizing language in healthcare. We conducted a
systematic search of the literature to identify existing stigmatizing language
lexicons and then analyzed them comparatively to examine: 1) similarities and
discrepancies between these lexicons, and 2) the distribution of positive,
negative, or neutral terms based on an established sentiment dataset. Our
search identified four lexicons. The analysis results revealed moderate
semantic similarity among them, and that most stigmatizing terms are related to
judgmental expressions by clinicians to describe perceived negative behaviors.
Sentiment analysis showed a predominant proportion of negatively classified
terms, though variations exist across lexicons. Our findings underscore the
need for a standardized lexicon and highlight challenges in defining
stigmatizing language in clinical texts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HALT-RAG is a post-hoc verification system that detects hallucinations in input-output pairs produced by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) language models, achieving strong results across tasks and balancing performance with safety needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of detecting hallucinations in content outputs from generative language models.

Method: The approach proposes a meta-classifier framework using a feature set derived from two frozen off-the-shelf Natural Language Inference (NLI) models and lightweight lexical signals, trained with rigorous cross-validation protocols.

Result: HALT-RAG achieved high F1-scores for summarization (0.7756), QA (0.9786), and dialogue (0.7391) tasks, utilizing unbiased evaluation and decision policies.

Conclusion: HALT-RAG provides an effective and flexible solution for hallucination detection with well-calibrated probabilities, supporting safer language model deployment.

Abstract: Detecting content that contradicts or is unsupported by a given source text
is a critical challenge for the safe deployment of generative language models.
We introduce HALT-RAG, a post-hoc verification system designed to identify
hallucinations in the outputs of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
pipelines. Our flexible and task-adaptable framework uses a universal feature
set derived from an ensemble of two frozen, off-the-shelf Natural Language
Inference (NLI) models and lightweight lexical signals. These features are used
to train a simple, calibrated, and task-adapted meta-classifier. Using a
rigorous 5-fold out-of-fold (OOF) training protocol to prevent data leakage and
produce unbiased estimates, we evaluate our system on the HaluEval benchmark.
By pairing our universal feature set with a lightweight, task-adapted
classifier and a precision-constrained decision policy, HALT-RAG achieves
strong OOF F1-scores of 0.7756, 0.9786, and 0.7391 on the summarization, QA,
and dialogue tasks, respectively. The system's well-calibrated probabilities
enable a practical abstention mechanism, providing a reliable tool for

TL;DR: This paper introduces ALLabel, a framework combining active learning with LLM in-context learning to reduce annotation costs while maintaining high performance in entity recognition tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the significant costs associated with fine-tuning large language models for entity recognition in scientific domains.

Method: ALLabel employs a three-stage active learning framework to identify and annotate the most informative samples, creating a retrieval corpus for LLM in-context learning.

Result: ALLabel consistently outperforms baselines under the same annotation budget by annotating only 5-10% of datasets, achieving comparable results to full dataset annotation.

Conclusion: Selective annotation via ALLabel offers a cost-efficient and effective approach for dataset preparation while maintaining high model accuracy, making it generalizable across domains.

Abstract: Many contemporary data-driven research efforts in the natural sciences, such
as chemistry and materials science, require large-scale, high-performance
entity recognition from scientific datasets. Large language models (LLMs) have
increasingly been adopted to solve the entity recognition task, with the same
trend being observed on all-spectrum NLP tasks. The prevailing entity
recognition LLMs rely on fine-tuned technology, yet the fine-tuning process
often incurs significant cost. To achieve a best performance-cost trade-off, we
propose ALLabel, a three-stage framework designed to select the most
informative and representative samples in preparing the demonstrations for LLM
modeling. The annotated examples are used to construct a ground-truth retrieval
corpus for LLM in-context learning. By sequentially employing three distinct
active learning strategies, ALLabel consistently outperforms all baselines
under the same annotation budget across three specialized domain datasets.
Experimental results also demonstrate that selectively annotating only 5\%-10\%
of the dataset with ALLabel can achieve performance comparable to the method
annotating the entire dataset. Further analyses and ablation studies verify the
effectiveness and generalizability of our proposal.

Motivation: To address the risks associated with over-execution of tasks by OS agents in real-world environments that may present untrustworthy conditions.

Method: The researchers propose a query-driven human-agent-GUI interaction framework and train VeriOS-Agent using a two-stage learning paradigm to decouple and utilize meta-knowledge.

Result: VeriOS-Agent demonstrates a 20.64% improvement in step-wise success rate in untrustworthy scenarios compared to state-of-the-art approaches, while maintaining normal performance.

Conclusion: The study shows that VeriOS-Agent effectively balances autonomous execution and human querying, proving its rationality, generalizability, and scalability in dynamic task environments.

Abstract: With the rapid progress of multimodal large language models, operating system
(OS) agents become increasingly capable of automating tasks through on-device
graphical user interfaces (GUIs). However, most existing OS agents are designed
for idealized settings, whereas real-world environments often present
untrustworthy conditions. To mitigate risks of over-execution in such
scenarios, we propose a query-driven human-agent-GUI interaction framework that
enables OS agents to decide when to query humans for more reliable task
completion. Built upon this framework, we introduce VeriOS-Agent, a trustworthy
OS agent trained with a two-stage learning paradigm that falicitate the
decoupling and utilization of meta-knowledge. Concretely, VeriOS-Agent
autonomously executes actions in normal conditions while proactively querying
humans in untrustworthy scenarios. Experiments show that VeriOS-Agent improves
the average step-wise success rate by 20.64\% in untrustworthy scenarios over
the state-of-the-art, without compromising normal performance. Analysis
highlights VeriOS-Agent's rationality, generalizability, and scalability. The

TL;DR: This paper proposes IRAKE, a method addressing challenges in knowledge editing for multi-hop question answering in LLMs, outperforming existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs quickly become outdated as information changes, and retraining them is costly. Current KE methods fail in multi-hop question answering due to 'edit skipping.'

Method: The authors introduce IRAKE, which uses iterative retrieval-augmented editing with guided decomposition to target issues like edit skipping.

Result: IRAKE significantly reduces edit skipping and performs better than current KE methods in multi-hop question answering tasks.

Conclusion: IRAKE is an effective solution for improving KE in LLMs, offering superior performance in complex tasks like multi-hop question answering.

Abstract: In a rapidly evolving world where information updates swiftly, knowledge in
large language models (LLMs) becomes outdated quickly. Retraining LLMs is not a
cost-effective option, making knowledge editing (KE) without modifying
parameters particularly necessary. We find that although existing
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based KE methods excel at editing simple
knowledge, they struggle with KE in multi-hop question answering due to the
issue of "edit skipping", which refers to skipping the relevant edited fact in
inference. In addition to the diversity of natural language expressions of
knowledge, edit skipping also arises from the mismatch between the granularity
of LLMs in problem-solving and the facts in the edited memory. To address this
issue, we propose a novel Iterative Retrieval-Augmented Knowledge Editing
method with guided decomposition (IRAKE) through the guidance from single
edited facts and entire edited cases. Experimental results demonstrate that
IRAKE mitigates the failure of editing caused by edit skipping and outperforms
state-of-the-art methods for KE in multi-hop question answering.

*Andrey Sakhovskiy,Elena Tutubalina*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This work presents BALI, a method that integrates Language Models (LMs) with biomedical Knowledge Graphs (KGs) for better text comprehension and representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing biomedical LLMs lack effective understanding of complex domain-specific concepts and factual information from Knowledge Graphs.

Method: The authors propose a joint pre-training approach for aligning LMs with KGs. They link biomedical concepts to a KG (UMLS), use subgraphs as cross-modal samples, and employ a dedicated KG encoder.

Result: The proposed method enhances the performance of biomedical LMs, such as PubMedBERT and BioLinkBERT, on text understanding and entity representation tasks.

Conclusion: BALI demonstrates that incorporating KGs with minimal pre-training data significantly boosts biomedical LMs' capabilities.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been substantial progress in using pretrained
Language Models (LMs) on a range of tasks aimed at improving the understanding
of biomedical texts. Nonetheless, existing biomedical LLMs show limited
comprehension of complex, domain-specific concept structures and the factual
information encoded in biomedical Knowledge Graphs (KGs). In this work, we
propose BALI (Biomedical Knowledge Graph and Language Model Alignment), a novel
joint LM and KG pre-training method that augments an LM with external knowledge
by the simultaneous learning of a dedicated KG encoder and aligning the
representations of both the LM and the graph. For a given textual sequence, we
link biomedical concept mentions to the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS)
KG and utilize local KG subgraphs as cross-modal positive samples for these
mentions. Our empirical findings indicate that implementing our method on
several leading biomedical LMs, such as PubMedBERT and BioLinkBERT, improves
their performance on a range of language understanding tasks and the quality of
entity representations, even with minimal pre-training on a small alignment
dataset sourced from PubMed scientific abstracts.

*Libo Ren,Yee Man Ng,Lifeng Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Perspective-Aware Iterative Self-Prompting (PA-ISP) methodology using large language models like GPT-4 to summarize clinical case documents effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical reports are often lengthy and filled with technical jargon, hindering efficient communication and shared decision-making between patients and clinicians. Better summarization methods are needed.

Method: The authors used Iterative Self-Prompting (ISP) with LLMs. It involved generating task-specific prompts refined via few-shot learning and guided fine-tuning using metrics like ROUGE and BERT-score.

Result: The approach demonstrated high semantic equivalence in summaries (high BERTscores: 87.84, 83.25, 85.46 for P, R, F1) but lower lexicon overlap (ROUGE scores: 46.53, 24.68, 30.77) across 3,396 clinical case reports.

Conclusion: Using PA-ISP on GPT-4 can effectively summarize clinical reports to improve patient-clinician communication.

Abstract: Efficient communication between patients and clinicians plays an important
role in shared decision-making. However, clinical reports are often lengthy and
filled with clinical jargon, making it difficult for domain experts to identify
important aspects in the document efficiently. This paper presents the
methodology we applied in the MultiClinSUM shared task for summarising clinical
case documents. We used an Iterative Self-Prompting technique on large language
models (LLMs) by asking LLMs to generate task-specific prompts and refine them
via example-based few-shot learning. Furthermore, we used lexical and embedding
space metrics, ROUGE and BERT-score, to guide the model fine-tuning with
epochs. Our submission using perspective-aware ISP on GPT-4 and GPT-4o achieved
ROUGE scores (46.53, 24.68, 30.77) and BERTscores (87.84, 83.25, 85.46) for (P,
R, F1) from the official evaluation on 3,396 clinical case reports from various
specialties extracted from open journals. The high BERTscore indicates that the
model produced semantically equivalent output summaries compared to the
references, even though the overlap at the exact lexicon level is lower, as
reflected in the lower ROUGE scores. This work sheds some light on how
perspective-aware ISP (PA-ISP) can be deployed for clinical report
summarisation and support better communication between patients and clinicians.

### [59] [MoLoRAG: Bootstrapping Document Understanding via Multi-modal Logic-aware Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07666)
*Xixi Wu,Yanchao Tan,Nan Hou,Ruiyang Zhang,Hong Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces MoLoRAG, a logic-aware retrieval framework that improves multi-modal, multi-page document understanding by enhancing semantic and logical relevance in retrieval and leveraging Large Vision-Language Models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DocQA methods struggle to handle multi-modal and multi-page document comprehension effectively due to input constraints and reliance solely on semantic relevance.

Method: MoLoRAG builds a page graph capturing contextual relationships between pages, employs VLM for graph traversal, and integrates semantic and logical relevance in retrieval to enhance document understanding.

Result: Experiments show 9.68% improvement in accuracy compared to LVLM direct inference and a 7.44% increase in retrieval precision over baselines across four DocQA datasets.

Conclusion: MoLoRAG successfully improves multi-page document understanding by addressing current limitations and offers a flexible solution via training-free and fine-tuned variants.

Abstract: Document Understanding is a foundational AI capability with broad
applications, and Document Question Answering (DocQA) is a key evaluation task.
Traditional methods convert the document into text for processing by Large
Language Models (LLMs), but this process strips away critical multi-modal
information like figures. While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) address
this limitation, their constrained input size makes multi-page document
comprehension infeasible. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods mitigate
this by selecting relevant pages, but they rely solely on semantic relevance,
ignoring logical connections between pages and the query, which is essential
for reasoning.
  To this end, we propose MoLoRAG, a logic-aware retrieval framework for
multi-modal, multi-page document understanding. By constructing a page graph
that captures contextual relationships between pages, a lightweight VLM
performs graph traversal to retrieve relevant pages, including those with
logical connections often overlooked. This approach combines semantic and
logical relevance to deliver more accurate retrieval. After retrieval, the
top-$K$ pages are fed into arbitrary LVLMs for question answering. To enhance
flexibility, MoLoRAG offers two variants: a training-free solution for easy
deployment and a fine-tuned version to improve logical relevance checking.
Experiments on four DocQA datasets demonstrate average improvements of 9.68% in
accuracy over LVLM direct inference and 7.44% in retrieval precision over
baselines. Codes and datasets are released at

### [60] [M-BRe: Discovering Training Samples for Relation Extraction from Unlabeled Texts with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07730)
*Zexuan Li,Hongliang Dai,Piji Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces M-BRe, a framework designed to efficiently extract training instances for Relation Extraction (RE) from unlabeled texts, addressing key challenges in leveraging large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual annotation for RE is expensive due to the rarity of target relations, necessitating an automated solution to train RE models effectively and efficiently.

Method: The M-BRe framework integrates three modules—Relation Grouping, Relation Extraction, and Label Decision—to balance the benefits of multi-class and binary classification approaches.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that M-BRe successfully discovers high-quality training samples for RE, outperforming existing methods in efficiency and scalability.

Conclusion: M-BRe proves to be a practical and effective solution for automatically generating RE training data, mitigating the limitations of LLMs in multi-class and binary classification setups for RE tasks.

Abstract: For Relation Extraction (RE), the manual annotation of training data may be
prohibitively expensive, since the sentences that contain the target relations
in texts can be very scarce and difficult to find. It is therefore beneficial
to develop an efficient method that can automatically extract training
instances from unlabeled texts for training RE models. Recently, large language
models (LLMs) have been adopted in various natural language processing tasks,
with RE also benefiting from their advances. However, when leveraging LLMs for
RE with predefined relation categories, two key challenges arise. First, in a
multi-class classification setting, LLMs often struggle to comprehensively
capture the semantics of every relation, leading to suboptimal results. Second,
although employing binary classification for each relation individually can
mitigate this issue, it introduces significant computational overhead,
resulting in impractical time complexity for real-world applications.
Therefore, this paper proposes a framework called M-BRe to extract training
instances from unlabeled texts for RE. It utilizes three modules to combine the
advantages of both of the above classification approaches: Relation Grouping,
Relation Extraction, and Label Decision. Extensive experiments confirm its
superior capability in discovering high-quality training samples from unlabeled
texts for RE.

### [61] [Factuality Beyond Coherence: Evaluating LLM Watermarking Methods for Medical Texts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07755)
*Rochana Prih Hastuti,Rian Adam Rajagede,Mansour Al Ghanim,Mengxin Zheng,Qian Lou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates watermarking reliability in medical LLMs and introduces the Factuality-Weighted Score (FWS) to assess factual accuracy and coherence concurrently. It finds existing watermarking harms medical content integrity, emphasizing the need for domain-specific methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In sensitive domains like medicine, the fluency of LLMs raises safety concerns due to risks in provenance and accountability, thereby necessitating reliable watermarking techniques.

Method: The researchers developed a medical-specific evaluation workflow, combining automated methods (GPT-Judger) and human validation, and introduced the Factuality-Weighted Score (FWS) as a metric to assess both factual accuracy and coherence.

Result: Current watermarking methods degrade the factual accuracy and representation of medical entities due to entropy shifts, demonstrating significant limitations in medical contexts.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of developing domain-aware watermarking strategies tailored to preserving the integrity and accuracy of medical content.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) adapted to sensitive domains such as
medicine, their fluency raises safety risks, particularly regarding provenance
and accountability. Watermarking embeds detectable patterns to mitigate these
risks, yet its reliability in medical contexts remains untested. Existing
benchmarks focus on detection-quality tradeoffs, overlooking factual risks
under low-entropy settings often exploited by watermarking's reweighting
strategy. We propose a medical-focused evaluation workflow that jointly
assesses factual accuracy and coherence. Using GPT-Judger and further human
validation, we introduce the Factuality-Weighted Score (FWS), a composite
metric prioritizing factual accuracy beyond coherence to guide watermarking
deployment in medical domains. Our evaluation shows current watermarking
methods substantially compromise medical factuality, with entropy shifts
degrading medical entity representation. These findings underscore the need for
domain-aware watermarking approaches that preserve the integrity of medical
content.

*Michele Joshua Maggini,Dhia Merzougui,Rabiraj Bandyopadhyay,Gaël Dias,Fabrice Maurel,Pablo Gamallo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper benchmarks the performance of large language models in detecting fake news and political biases across various languages and adaptation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growth of fake news, harmful content, and political polarization on online platforms necessitates effective detection mechanisms.

Method: The study examines multiple language models and adaptation methods, comparing Fine-Tuning and In-Context Learning strategies across datasets in five languages.

Result: The experiments reveal that Fine-Tuning smaller models on task-specific settings often outperforms In-Context Learning, even with large models.

Conclusion: Fine-Tuning proves to be a more effective approach than In-Context Learning for detecting biased and harmful content across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: The spread of fake news, polarizing, politically biased, and harmful content
on online platforms has been a serious concern. With large language models
becoming a promising approach, however, no study has properly benchmarked their
performance across different models, usage methods, and languages. This study
presents a comprehensive overview of different Large Language Models adaptation
paradigms for the detection of hyperpartisan and fake news, harmful tweets, and
political bias. Our experiments spanned 10 datasets and 5 different languages
(English, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic and Bulgarian), covering both binary and
multiclass classification scenarios. We tested different strategies ranging
from parameter efficient Fine-Tuning of language models to a variety of
different In-Context Learning strategies and prompts. These included zero-shot
prompts, codebooks, few-shot (with both randomly-selected and
diversely-selected examples using Determinantal Point Processes), and
Chain-of-Thought. We discovered that In-Context Learning often underperforms
when compared to Fine-Tuning a model. This main finding highlights the
importance of Fine-Tuning even smaller models on task-specific settings even
when compared to the largest models evaluated in an In-Context Learning setup -
in our case LlaMA3.1-8b-Instruct, Mistral-Nemo-Instruct-2407 and
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct.

*Decheng Duan,Yingyi Zhang,Jitong Peng,Chengzhi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SciNLP introduces the first full-text annotated dataset for entity and relation extraction in NLP publications, significantly aiding model performance and enabling automatic knowledge graph creation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current datasets for scientific text extraction often focus on specific sections rather than full text, limiting comprehensive understanding in specialized fields due to high annotation costs.

Method: The authors created SciNLP, manually annotating 60 full-text NLP publications with 7,072 entities and 1,826 relations. They evaluated state-of-the-art supervised models and compared performance with existing datasets.

Result: SciNLP outperformed other datasets in certain baseline model extractions, enabling the construction of a comprehensive NLP knowledge graph with high semantic richness, measured by a node degree of 3.2 per entity.

Conclusion: SciNLP is a benchmark advancement for full-text entity and relation extraction in NLP, enhancing model development and downstream applications like knowledge graph construction. The dataset is openly available for further research.

Abstract: Structured information extraction from scientific literature is crucial for
capturing core concepts and emerging trends in specialized fields. While
existing datasets aid model development, most focus on specific publication
sections due to domain complexity and the high cost of annotating scientific
texts. To address this limitation, we introduce SciNLP - a specialized
benchmark for full-text entity and relation extraction in the Natural Language
Processing (NLP) domain. The dataset comprises 60 manually annotated full-text
NLP publications, covering 7,072 entities and 1,826 relations. Compared to
existing research, SciNLP is the first dataset providing full-text annotations
of entities and their relationships in the NLP domain. To validate the
effectiveness of SciNLP, we conducted comparative experiments with similar
datasets and evaluated the performance of state-of-the-art supervised models on
this dataset. Results reveal varying extraction capabilities of existing models
across academic texts of different lengths. Cross-comparisons with existing
datasets show that SciNLP achieves significant performance improvements on
certain baseline models. Using models trained on SciNLP, we implemented
automatic construction of a fine-grained knowledge graph for the NLP domain.
Our KG has an average node degree of 3.2 per entity, indicating rich semantic
topological information that enhances downstream applications. The dataset is
publicly available at https://github.com/AKADDC/SciNLP.

*Xiaolin Chen,Xuemeng Song,Haokun Wen,Weili Guan,Xiangyu Zhao,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes DK2R, a novel method using dual knowledge (structured attributes and unstructured review data) and LLMs to improve textual response generation in multimodal task-oriented dialogue systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multimodal dialogue systems underutilize unstructured review knowledge and large language models, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: The authors designed DK2R, a two-stage reasoning framework that extracts structured attributes and unstructured reviews, evaluates their utility using LLMs, and decouples intention and response for enhanced response generation.

Result: DK2R outperformed other approaches in experiments conducted on a public dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed DK2R framework effectively addresses key challenges—dynamic knowledge selection and intention-response decoupling—showcasing its applicability in improving multimodal dialogue systems.

Abstract: Textual response generation is pivotal for multimodal \mbox{task-oriented}
dialog systems, which aims to generate proper textual responses based on the
multimodal context. While existing efforts have demonstrated remarkable
progress, there still exist the following limitations: 1) \textit{neglect of
unstructured review knowledge} and 2) \textit{underutilization of large
language models (LLMs)}. Inspired by this, we aim to fully utilize dual
knowledge (\textit{i.e., } structured attribute and unstructured review
knowledge) with LLMs to promote textual response generation in multimodal
task-oriented dialog systems. However, this task is non-trivial due to two key
challenges: 1) \textit{dynamic knowledge type selection} and 2)
\textit{intention-response decoupling}. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel dual knowledge-enhanced two-stage reasoner by adapting LLMs for
multimodal dialog systems (named DK2R). To be specific, DK2R first extracts
both structured attribute and unstructured review knowledge from external
knowledge base given the dialog context. Thereafter, DK2R uses an LLM to
evaluate each knowledge type's utility by analyzing LLM-generated provisional
probe responses. Moreover, DK2R separately summarizes the intention-oriented
key clues via dedicated reasoning, which are further used as auxiliary signals
to enhance LLM-based textual response generation. Extensive experiments
conducted on a public dataset verify the superiority of DK2R. We have released
the codes and parameters.

### [65] [Small Open Models Achieve Near Parity with Large Models in Low Resource Literary Translation at a Fraction of the Cost](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07829)
*Mihai Nadas,Laura Diosan,Andreea Tomescu,Andrei Piscoran*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents TF2, an open framework aimed at improving English-Romanian literary translation via a new dataset and a fine-tuned compact model (TF2-12B), achieving translation quality competitive with proprietary models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the challenge of using small, open models for literary translation in low-resource languages like Romanian, emphasizing the need for high-quality datasets and efficient methods.

Method: TF2 involves a pipeline for dataset creation (DS-TF2-EN-RO), generating synthetic Romanian references, instruction tuning, and adapter compression applied to a 12B open-weight model. Evaluation combines BLEU and a multi-dimensional rubric.

Result: The TF2-12B model achieves translation fluency and adequacy comparable to proprietary models, while being cost-efficient and open. Datasets and supporting scripts are released for public use.

Conclusion: TF2 successfully advances literary machine translation research, offering reproducible tools for translating culturally significant content in low-resource languages efficiently and accessibly.

Abstract: Literary translation has recently gained attention as a distinct and complex
task in machine translation research. However, the translation by small open
models remains an open problem. We contribute to this ongoing research by
introducing TINYFABULIST TRANSLATION FRAMEWORK (TF2), a unified framework for
dataset creation, fine tuning, and evaluation in English-Romanian literary
translations, centred on the creation and open release of both a compact, fine
tuned language model (TF2-12B) and large scale synthetic parallel datasets
(DS-TF2-EN-RO-3M and DS-TF2-EN-RO-15K). Building on DS-TF1-EN-3M (TF1), the
largest collection of synthetic English fables to date, we address the need for
rich, high quality literary datasets in low resource languages such as
Romanian. Our pipeline first generates 15k high quality Romanian references
from the TF1 pool using a high performing LLM. We then apply a two stage fine
tuning process to a 12B parameter open weight model: (i) instruction tuning to
capture genre specific narrative style, and (ii) adapter compression for
efficient deployment. Evaluation combines corpus level BLEU and a five
dimension LLM based rubric (accuracy, fluency, coherence, style, cultural
adaptation) to provide a nuanced assessment of translation quality. Results
show that our fine tuned model achieves fluency and adequacy competitive with
top performing large proprietary models, while being open, accessible, and
significantly more cost effective. Alongside the fine tuned model and both
datasets, we publicly release all scripts and evaluation prompts. TF2 thus
provides an end-to-end, reproducible pipeline for research on cost efficient
translation, cross lingual narrative generation, and the broad adoption of open
models for culturally significant literary content in low resource settings.

### [66] [Are Humans as Brittle as Large Language Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07869)
*Jiahui Li,Sean Papay,Roman Klinger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether the sensitivity of large language models (LLMs) to prompt modifications mirrors human annotators' response to similar changes, finding LLMs and humans exhibit brittleness under certain conditions, but are affected differently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if prompt brittleness in LLMs, often considered problematic, accurately reflects human annotation variances.

Method: The study systematically compares LLMs' and humans' reactions to prompt variations by conducting text classification tasks using modified instructions.

Result: Both humans and LLMs exhibit sensitivity to certain prompt modifications, such as substitution of label sets, though humans are less affected by typographical errors and reversed label order.

Conclusion: Prompt brittleness is a shared phenomenon but manifests differently between humans and LLMs, suggesting a nuanced understanding of LLM reliability is required.

Abstract: The output of large language models (LLM) is unstable, due to both
non-determinism of the decoding process as well as to prompt brittleness. While
the intrinsic non-determinism of LLM generation may mimic existing uncertainty
in human annotations through distributional shifts in outputs, it is largely
assumed, yet unexplored, that the prompt brittleness effect is unique to LLMs.
This raises the question: do human annotators show similar sensitivity to
instruction changes? If so, should prompt brittleness in LLMs be considered
problematic? One may alternatively hypothesize that prompt brittleness
correctly reflects human annotation variances. To fill this research gap, we
systematically compare the effects of prompt modifications on LLMs and
identical instruction modifications for human annotators, focusing on the
question of whether humans are similarly sensitive to prompt perturbations. To
study this, we prompt both humans and LLMs for a set of text classification
tasks conditioned on prompt variations. Our findings indicate that both humans
and LLMs exhibit increased brittleness in response to specific types of prompt
modifications, particularly those involving the substitution of alternative
label sets or label formats. However, the distribution of human judgments is
less affected by typographical errors and reversed label order than that of
LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to promote fairness and control in natural language generation by addressing sentence-level gender biases.

Method: The approach involves fine-tuning large language models using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), constructing balanced datasets, integrating expert model outputs via majority voting, and applying a multi-temperature sampling mechanism.

Result: The team's method achieved an average score of 47.90% in the shared task, ranking fourth overall.

Conclusion: The proposed techniques effectively handle gender bias detection, classification, and mitigation, demonstrating strong outcomes in a competitive environment.

Abstract: This paper presents our team's solution to Shared Task 7 of NLPCC-2025, which
focuses on sentence-level gender bias detection and mitigation in Chinese. The
task aims to promote fairness and controllability in natural language
generation by automatically detecting, classifying, and mitigating gender bias.
To address this challenge, we adopt a fine-tuning approach based on large
language models (LLMs), efficiently adapt to the bias detection task via
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). In terms of data processing, we construct a more
balanced training set to alleviate class imbalance and introduce heterogeneous
samples from multiple sources to enhance model generalization. For the
detection and classification sub-tasks, we employ a majority voting strategy
that integrates outputs from multiple expert models to boost performance.
Additionally, to improve bias generation detection and mitigation, we design a
multi-temperature sampling mechanism to capture potential variations in bias
expression styles. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in bias detection, classification, and mitigation. Our method
ultimately achieves an average score of 47.90%, ranking fourth in the shared
task.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Biased Tales dataset to analyze biases in LLM-generated stories, revealing disparities in gender and cultural representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigating cultural and gender stereotyping in AI-crafted bedtime stories, as parents increasingly use LLMs to generate narratives for children.

Method: The authors analyze the Biased Tales dataset, which examines the influence of biases on protagonists' attributes and story elements in stories created by large language models.

Result: The analysis shows girls are 55.26% more associated with appearance-related traits, while non-Western children are disproportionately linked to heritage, tradition, and family themes compared to Western children.

Conclusion: The study underscores sociocultural biases in LLM-generated content and calls for enhancing diversity and equity in creative AI applications.

Abstract: Stories play a pivotal role in human communication, shaping beliefs and
morals, particularly in children. As parents increasingly rely on large
language models (LLMs) to craft bedtime stories, the presence of cultural and
gender stereotypes in these narratives raises significant concerns. To address
this issue, we present Biased Tales, a comprehensive dataset designed to
analyze how biases influence protagonists' attributes and story elements in
LLM-generated stories. Our analysis uncovers striking disparities. When the
protagonist is described as a girl (as compared to a boy), appearance-related
attributes increase by 55.26%. Stories featuring non-Western children
disproportionately emphasize cultural heritage, tradition, and family themes
far more than those for Western children. Our findings highlight the role of
sociocultural bias in making creative AI use more equitable and diverse.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the shortcomings of existing methods in uncertainty estimation, especially their reliance on token-level probability measures that lack semantic dependency modeling.

Method: The study leverages dependency parse trees and hierarchical graph pooling to model semantic and structural relationships within generated text.

Result: GENUINE achieved up to 29% higher AUROC and reduced calibration errors by over 15% compared to semantic entropy-based approaches.

Conclusion: Graph-based uncertainty modeling significantly enhances confidence assessments in LLMs, making them more reliable for high-stakes applications.

Abstract: Uncertainty estimation is essential for enhancing the reliability of Large
Language Models (LLMs), particularly in high-stakes applications. Existing
methods often overlook semantic dependencies, relying on token-level

leverages dependency parse trees and hierarchical graph pooling to refine
uncertainty quantification. By incorporating supervised learning, GENUINE
effectively models semantic and structural relationships, improving confidence

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address issues such as noisy labels, topic bias, and question redundancy in existing benchmarks for LLM factuality evaluation.

Method: They employed a multi-stage filtering process (deduplication, topic balancing, source reconciliation) to create a high-quality benchmark and improved autorater prompts.

Result: Gemini 2.5 Pro achieved an F1-score of 55.6 on SimpleQA Verified, outperforming other top models like GPT-5.

Conclusion: The study provides a robust tool for the research community to better evaluate LLM factuality and reduce hallucinations in responses.

Abstract: We introduce SimpleQA Verified, a 1,000-prompt benchmark for evaluating Large
Language Model (LLM) short-form factuality based on OpenAI's SimpleQA. It
addresses critical limitations in OpenAI's benchmark, including noisy and
incorrect labels, topical biases, and question redundancy. SimpleQA Verified
was created through a rigorous multi-stage filtering process involving
de-duplication, topic balancing, and source reconciliation to produce a more

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Parallel thinking is introduced as a method to enhance reasoning in large language models (LLMs). The proposed Parallel-R1 framework uses a progressive curriculum incorporating supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to address real-world problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing supervised methods fail to effectively activate exploration and generalization aspects in LLMs for complex tasks. There is a need for innovative training frameworks for parallel reasoning capabilities.

Method: Employ a two-stage training approach: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to instill parallel thinking, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) on harder tasks to explore and generalize the ability.

Result: Parallel-R1 achieves an 8.4% accuracy improvement in various math benchmarks like MATH and AMC23. On AIME25, it demonstrates a 42.9% accuracy gain, showcasing enhanced reasoning behavior and problem-solving.

Conclusion: Parallel thinking, used as a mid-training exploration scaffold, enables deeper reasoning capabilities, leading to significant performance improvements in real-world reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Parallel thinking has emerged as a novel approach for enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by exploring multiple reasoning
paths concurrently. However, activating such capabilities through training
remains challenging, as existing methods predominantly rely on supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) over synthetic data, which encourages teacher-forced
imitation rather than exploration and generalization. Different from them, we
propose \textbf{Parallel-R1}, the first reinforcement learning (RL) framework
that enables parallel thinking behaviors for complex real-world reasoning
tasks. Our framework employs a progressive curriculum that explicitly addresses
the cold-start problem in training parallel thinking with RL. We first use SFT
on prompt-generated trajectories from easier tasks to instill the parallel
thinking ability, then transition to RL to explore and generalize this skill on
harder problems. Experiments on various math benchmarks, including MATH, AMC23,
and AIME, show that Parallel-R1 successfully instills parallel thinking,
leading to 8.4% accuracy improvements over the sequential thinking model
trained directly on challenging tasks with RL. Further analysis reveals a clear
shift in the model's thinking behavior: at an early stage, it uses parallel
thinking as an exploration strategy, while in a later stage, it uses the same
capability for multi-perspective verification. Most significantly, we validate
parallel thinking as a \textbf{mid-training exploration scaffold}, where this
temporary exploratory phase unlocks a higher performance ceiling after RL,
yielding a 42.9% improvement over the baseline on AIME25. Our model, data, and
code will be open-source at https://github.com/zhengkid/Parallel-R1.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CellPainTR, a Transformer-based model for learning robust cellular morphology representations that generalize across datasets without requiring fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current challenges in large-scale biological studies include technical batch effects and the difficulty in building generalizable models for heterogeneous datasets.

Method: CellPainTR employs a Transformer architecture with source-specific context tokens as a means to effectively generalize across out-of-distribution datasets.

Result: CellPainTR demonstrated superior performance compared to methods like ComBat and Harmony in batch integration and biological signal preservation. Additionally, it showed robustness in OOD tasks with significant domain shifts.

Conclusion: CellPainTR advances foundational models for image-based profiling, enabling reliable cross-study biological analyses and addressing scalability and batch effect issues.

Abstract: Large-scale biological discovery requires integrating massive, heterogeneous
datasets like those from the JUMP Cell Painting consortium, but technical batch
effects and a lack of generalizable models remain critical roadblocks. To
address this, we introduce CellPainTR, a Transformer-based architecture
designed to learn foundational representations of cellular morphology that are
robust to batch effects. Unlike traditional methods that require retraining on
new data, CellPainTR's design, featuring source-specific context tokens, allows
for effective out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization to entirely unseen
datasets without fine-tuning. We validate CellPainTR on the large-scale JUMP
dataset, where it outperforms established methods like ComBat and Harmony in
both batch integration and biological signal preservation. Critically, we
demonstrate its robustness through a challenging OOD task on the unseen Bray et
al. dataset, where it maintains high performance despite significant domain and
feature shifts. Our work represents a significant step towards creating truly
foundational models for image-based profiling, enabling more reliable and
scalable cross-study biological analysis.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multimodal fusion architecture combining YOLOv8n and Vision Transformer (ViT) to detect railway defects using audio and image data, improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of single-modality approaches (such as YOLO-based object detection) in detecting railway defects, which often lead to overdetection caused by structural similarities.

Method: The paper develops a multimodal fusion model integrating YOLOv8n for object detection and Vision Transformer (ViT) to combine image features across layers (7, 16, 19) with synthesized audio data.

Result: The proposed multimodal approach improves precision and accuracy by 0.2 points over the vision-only model, with the differences being statistically significant as verified by Student's unpaired t-test.

Conclusion: Multimodal fusion techniques effectively enhance the detection of railway defects by leveraging information from both audio and image modalities, demonstrating superiority over single-modality models.

Abstract: Multimodal fusion is a multimedia technique that has become popular in the
wide range of tasks where image information is accompanied by a signal/audio.
The latter may not convey highly semantic information, such as speech or music,
but some measures such as audio signal recorded by mics in the goal to detect
rail structure elements or defects. While classical detection approaches such
as You Only Look Once (YOLO) family detectors can be efficiently deployed for
defect detection on the image modality, the single modality approaches remain
limited. They yield an overdetection in case of the appearance similar to
normal structural elements. The paper proposes a new multimodal fusion
architecture built on the basis of domain rules with YOLO and Vision
transformer backbones. It integrates YOLOv8n for rapid object detection with a
Vision Transformer (ViT) to combine feature maps extracted from multiple layers
(7, 16, and 19) and synthesised audio representations for two defect classes:
rail Rupture and Surface defect. Fusion is performed between audio and image.
Experimental evaluation on a real-world railway dataset demonstrates that our
multimodal fusion improves precision and overall accuracy by 0.2 points
compared to the vision-only approach. Student's unpaired t-test also confirms
statistical significance of differences in the mean accuracy.

*Yingsheng Wang,Shuo Lu,Jian Liang,Aihua Zheng,Ran He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ClaFR, a method for OOD detection that doesn't require training data, ensuring data privacy protection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing OOD detection under data privacy constraints since existing feature-based post-hoc methods often require access to training data.

Method: ClaFR uses orthogonal decomposition of classifier weights to extract a class-known subspace. Features are projected onto this subspace, and OOD scores are derived from feature reconstruction errors.

Result: ClaFR demonstrates leading performance on multiple OOD benchmarks without requiring training data.

Conclusion: ClaFR offers an effective and privacy-preserving approach for OOD detection, with strong benchmark results and potential applications in security-related fields.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection helps models identify data outside the
training categories, crucial for security applications. While feature-based
post-hoc methods address this by evaluating data differences in the feature
space without changing network parameters, they often require access to
training data, which may not be suitable for some data privacy scenarios. This
may not be suitable in scenarios where data privacy protection is a concern. In
this paper, we propose a simple yet effective post-hoc method, termed
Classifier-based Feature Reconstruction (ClaFR), from the perspective of
subspace projection. It first performs an orthogonal decomposition of the
classifier's weights to extract the class-known subspace, then maps the
original data features into this subspace to obtain new data representations.
Subsequently, the OOD score is determined by calculating the feature
reconstruction error of the data within the subspace. Compared to existing OOD
detection algorithms, our method does not require access to training data while
achieving leading performance on multiple OOD benchmarks. Our code is released
at https://github.com/Aie0923/ClaFR.

*Bryan Rodas,Natalie Montesino,Jakob Ambsdorf,David Klindt,Randall Balestriero*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DIET-CP is a simple continued pretraining strategy to adapt foundation models for specialized domains using small datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting foundation models to new, specialized domains is challenging due to small datasets, the infeasibility of SSL methods for large-scale data, and the lack of essential pretraining information in released backbone weights.

Method: DIET-CP uses a simple, label-free objective to continue pretraining, with no additional hyperparameters beyond those in supervised finetuning.

Result: DIET-CP demonstrates stable performance across modalities and backbones, achieving significant improvements using as few as 1000 images.

Conclusion: DIET-CP effectively addresses challenges in domain adaptation, steering foundation models towards specific distributions with minimal data and complexity.

Abstract: Continued pretraining offers a promising solution for adapting foundation
models to a new target domain. However, in specialized domains, available
datasets are often very small, limiting the applicability of SSL methods
developed for large-scale pretraining and making hyperparameter search
infeasible. In addition, pretrained models are usually released as
backbone-weights only, lacking important information to continue pretraining.
We propose to bridge this gap with DIET-CP, a simple continued pretraining
strategy, where any strong foundation model can be steered towards the new data
distribution of interest. DIET-CP relies on a very simple objective, requires
no labels, and introduces no more hyperparameters than supervised finetuning.
It is stable across data modalities and backbone choices, while providing a
significant performance boost for state-of-the-art models such as DINOv3 using
only 1000 images.

*Kun Zhai,Siheng Chen,Xingjun Ma,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Federated Adversarial Prompt Tuning (FedAPT) addresses adversarial robustness in collaborative fine-tuning of large Vision-Language Models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to improve the adversarial robustness of Federated Prompt Tuning (FPT), which is vulnerable to attacks in non-IID settings.

Method: The authors propose FedAPT, incorporating a class-aware prompt generator guided by Global Label Embedding and a cross-layer generator sharing strategy.

Result: FedAPT significantly boosts adversarial robustness across multiple datasets and excels in generalization for cross-domain and cross-dataset scenarios.

Conclusion: FedAPT enhances adversarial robustness and generalization in collaborative VLM fine-tuning, making it effective for real-world applications.

Abstract: Federated Prompt Tuning (FPT) is an efficient method for cross-client
collaborative fine-tuning of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However,
models tuned using FPT are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, leading to
misclassification in downstream tasks. In this work, we introduce Federated
Adversarial Prompt Tuning (\textbf{FedAPT}), a novel method designed to enhance
the adversarial robustness of FPT. We identify a key issue in FedAPT under
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) settings: a \textit{class
information gap} between clients and the global model. Clients rely solely on
limited local label information to generate adversarial samples for training,
while the global model must defend against adversarial attacks from global
labels. To address this issue, we propose a \textbf{class-aware prompt
generator} that generates visual prompts from text prompts. This generator is
guided by a \emph{Global Label Embedding} (serving as a ``beacon") which
encodes cross-client label information to create more globally-aligned visual
prompts. Additionally, we propose a \textbf{cross-layer generator sharing}
strategy to enhance prompt coupling across different layers of the model,
further boosting adversarial robustness. Extensive experiments on multiple
image classification datasets demonstrate the superiority of FedAPT in
improving adversarial robustness, outperforming existing methods by a large
margin. FedAPT also exhibits exceptional generalization in cross-domain and
cross-dataset scenarios, indicating its effectiveness in real-world
applications.

### [78] [VLMs-in-the-Wild: Bridging the Gap Between Academic Benchmarks and Enterprise Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06994)
*Srihari Bandraupalli,Anupam Purwar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the VLM-in-the-Wild (ViLD) framework to evaluate vision-language models (VLMs) in enterprise-grade tasks, moving beyond academic benchmarks. It includes real-world tests, highlights an innovative BlockWeaver Algorithm, and establishes a 7,500-sample benchmark dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the disconnect between academic evaluation of VLMs and real-world, enterprise-grade application requirements, especially for tasks like social media content analysis.

Method: The authors propose the ViLD framework with ten business-critical tasks and present the BlockWeaver Algorithm. They develop a benchmark dataset of 7,500 real-world samples and validate open-source VLMs against proprietary benchmarks using various evaluation techniques.

Result: The framework effectively evaluates VLMs' real-world applicability. It highlights strengths and weaknesses of models like Qwen, MIMO, and InternVL compared to a proprietary baseline.

Conclusion: ViLD offers an actionable, industry-relevant framework for assessing and improving VLMs for enterprise-grade applications, aiding in more practical deployments of open-source VLMs.

Abstract: Open-source Vision-Language Models show immense promise for enterprise
applications, yet a critical disconnect exists between academic evaluation and
enterprise deployment requirements. Current benchmarks rely heavily on
multiple-choice questions and synthetic data, failing to capture the complexity
of real-world business applications like social media content analysis. This
paper introduces VLM-in-the-Wild (ViLD), a comprehensive framework to bridge
this gap by evaluating VLMs on operational enterprise requirements. We define
ten business-critical tasks: logo detection, OCR, object detection, human
presence and demographic analysis, human activity and appearance analysis,
scene detection, camera perspective and media quality assessment, dominant
colors, comprehensive description, and NSFW detection. To this framework, we
bring an innovative BlockWeaver Algorithm that solves the challenging problem
of comparing unordered, variably-grouped OCR outputs from VLMs without relying
on embeddings or LLMs, achieving remarkable speed and reliability. To
demonstrate efficacy of ViLD, we constructed a new benchmark dataset of 7,500
diverse samples, carefully stratified from a corpus of one million real-world
images and videos. ViLD provides actionable insights by combining semantic
matching (both embedding-based and LLM-as-a-judge approaches), traditional
metrics, and novel methods to measure the completeness and faithfulness of
descriptive outputs. By benchmarking leading open-source VLMs (Qwen, MIMO, and
InternVL) against a powerful proprietary baseline as per ViLD framework, we
provide one of the first industry-grounded, task-driven assessment of VLMs
capabilities, offering actionable insights for their deployment in enterprise
environments.

### [79] [The Protocol Genome A Self Supervised Learning Framework from DICOM Headers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06995)
*Jimmy Joseph*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents the Protocol Genome, a self-supervised learning system designed to handle latent confounders in DICOM headers, achieving significant improvements in AUROC and calibration for medical imaging tasks across diverse modalities and vendors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges posed by latent confounders in medical imaging DICOM headers that hinder generalization of image-only models across sites and systems.

Method: Protocol Genome combines tokenized embeddings of de-identified DICOM header fields with image features using three techniques: protocol-image contrastive learning, masked protocol prediction, and protocol-protocol translation. It is trained across 1.26 million studies, including varied health systems, scanner types, and imaging modalities.

Result: The method outperforms strong baselines, achieving higher AUROC scores across tasks (+0.046 for PE, +0.058 for glioma, +0.041 for cardiomegaly), along with 25-37% improvements in calibration. These results are maintained even with 10-20% labeled data.

Conclusion: Protocol Genome enhances robustness, calibration, and generalization in clinical imaging applications. It reduces false positives at protocol borders and offers a practical solution for deployment in PACS systems with de-identification and bias audits included.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Protocol Genome, a self-supervised learning
system that learns correlations from DICOM headers and achieves AUROC 0.901 (vs
0.847 baseline) and ECE 0.036 (vs 0.058) on fully held-out external validation.
Our method also improves calibration and robustness across modalities (CT, MRI,
CXR) and vendors. Clinical imaging is funneled through PACS/DICOM, where
procedure choices (scanner make/model, sequence, kernel, kVp, TR/TE, and slice
thickness) have consequences for contrast, noise, and artifact. These latent
confounders impede the generalization of image-only networks across sites. We
consider structured DICOM headers as a label and learn protocol-aware but
clinically robust image representations. Protocol Genome obtains tokenized
embeddings of de-identified header fields and models them along with image
features using: (1) protocol-image contrastive learning, (2) masked protocol
prediction, and (3) protocol-protocol translation. With 1.26M studies (7 health
systems, 31 scanners, 3 vendors; CT, MR, CR/DR), we experiment on: (A) chest CT
triage for PE, (B) brain MRI glioma grading, and (C) chest radiograph
cardiomegaly detection. Relative to strong SSL baselines (SimCLR, MAE) as well
as ImageNet transfer, Protocol Genome (+0.046: PE, +0.058: glioma, +0.041:
cardiomegaly) is associated with higher external AUROC; 25-37% calibration
improvements are obtained (p < 0.01, DeLong tests). While the gains may be
task-dependent, they are preserved with 10-20% of labeled data. From a clinical
point of view, the technique reduces false positives at protocol borders and is
applicable in a PACS (DICOM C-FIND/C-MOVE, DICOMweb QIDO/WADO). We publish a
model card and deployment guide, complete with both de-identification and bias
audits.

### [80] [Visible Yet Unreadable: A Systematic Blind Spot of Vision Language Models Across Writing Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06996)
*Jie Zhang,Ting Xu,Gelei Deng,Runyi Hu,Han Qiu,Tianwei Zhang,Qing Guo,Ivor Tsang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper tests advanced vision language models (VLMs) on fragmented, recombined writing stimuli legible to humans. Models perform well on clean texts but fail on perturbations, revealing structural reliance on visual invariances over compositional literacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans demonstrate remarkable ability to recognize fragmented or altered text across various writing systems. This paper aims to examine whether advanced VLMs share similar resilience as humans.

Method: The authors created psychophysics-inspired benchmarks using Chinese and English glyphs, subjecting text stimuli to perturbations like splicing, recombination, and overlays. They evaluated how well VLMs and humans could interpret these modified text inputs.

Result: VLMs showed strong performance on clean text but a significant drop in accuracy on perturbed stimuli. Often, the models generated outputs that were unrelated or incoherent compared to human interpretation.

Conclusion: Current VLMs fail to replicate human-like robust literacy due to heavy reliance on visual invariances and lack of adequate compositional priors. Proposals for more effective architectures and training to improve symbol segmentation and understanding across scripts are suggested.

Abstract: Writing is a universal cultural technology that reuses vision for symbolic
communication. Humans display striking resilience: we readily recognize words
even when characters are fragmented, fused, or partially occluded. This paper
investigates whether advanced vision language models (VLMs) share this
resilience. We construct two psychophysics inspired benchmarks across distinct
writing systems, Chinese logographs and English alphabetic words, by splicing,
recombining, and overlaying glyphs to yield ''visible but unreadable'' stimuli
for models while remaining legible to humans. Despite strong performance on
clean text, contemporary VLMs show a severe drop under these perturbations,
frequently producing unrelated or incoherent outputs. The pattern suggests a
structural limitation: models heavily leverage generic visual invariances but
under rely on compositional priors needed for robust literacy. We release
stimuli generation code, prompts, and evaluation protocols to facilitate
transparent replication and follow up work. Our findings motivate architectures
and training strategies that encode symbol segmentation, composition, and
binding across scripts, and they delineate concrete challenges for deploying
multimodal systems in education, accessibility, cultural heritage, and
security.

*Guan Yu,Zhang Jianhua,Liang Dong,Liu Qiegen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper develops a method to synthesize high-quality, dynamic cardiac MRI data in the frequency (k-space) domain, addressing challenges caused by data scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic cardiac MRI reconstruction is hindered by the limited availability of high-quality k-space data due to its complex and dynamic nature.

Method: The authors propose feature-level learning directly in the frequency domain using a Fourier transform and a temporal-fusion strategy to synthesize k-space data. This avoids relying on pixel-level modeling in the image domain.

Result: The method demonstrates strong generative ability even in low-data settings, producing high-quality results in experimental evaluations.

Conclusion: The approach offers a promising solution to mitigate data scarcity in dynamic cardiac MRI reconstruction, showcasing stability and richness of data generation.

Abstract: Owing to the inherently dynamic and complex characteristics of cardiac
magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, high-quality and diverse k-space data are
rarely available in practice, which in turn hampers robust reconstruction of
dynamic cardiac MRI. To address this challenge, we perform feature-level
learning directly in the frequency domain and employ a temporal-fusion strategy
as the generative guidance to synthesize k-space data. Specifically, leveraging
the global representation capacity of the Fourier transform, the frequency
domain can be considered a natural global feature space. Therefore, unlike
traditional methods that use pixel-level convolution for feature learning and
modeling in the image domain, this letter focuses on feature-level modeling in
the frequency domain, enabling stable and rich generation even with ultra
low-data regimes. Moreover, leveraging the advantages of feature-level modeling
in the frequency domain, we integrate k-space data across time frames with
multiple fusion strategies to steer and further optimize the generative
trajectory. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method possesses
strong generative ability in low-data regimes, indicating practical potential
to alleviate data scarcity in dynamic MRI reconstruction.

*Liviu Nicolae Fircă,Antonio Bărbălau,Dan Oneata,Elena Burceanu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates if models can generalize attribute knowledge across dissimilar categories and introduces new train-test split methods for this analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether models can transfer attribute knowledge to conceptually distant and visually dissimilar object categories.

Method: Presented explicit evaluation methods including novel train-test splits based on semantic grouping, embedding similarity, clustering, and supercategory partitioning.

Result: The models' performance dropped significantly as correlations between training and testing categories reduced, with clustering showing the best balance.

Conclusion: Current models struggle to generalize attribute knowledge to semantically dissimilar categories, highlighting their limitations and informing future benchmark designs for attribute reasoning.

Abstract: Can models generalize attribute knowledge across semantically and
perceptually dissimilar categories? While prior work has addressed attribute
prediction within narrow taxonomic or visually similar domains, it remains
unclear whether current models can abstract attributes and apply them to
conceptually distant categories. This work presents the first explicit
evaluation for the robustness of the attribute prediction task under such
conditions, testing whether models can correctly infer shared attributes
between unrelated object types: e.g., identifying that the attribute "has four
legs" is common to both "dogs" and "chairs". To enable this evaluation, we
introduce train-test split strategies that progressively reduce correlation
between training and test sets, based on: LLM-driven semantic grouping,
embedding similarity thresholding, embedding-based clustering, and
supercategory-based partitioning using ground-truth labels. Results show a
sharp drop in performance as the correlation between training and test
categories decreases, indicating strong sensitivity to split design. Among the
evaluated methods, clustering yields the most effective trade-off, reducing
hidden correlations while preserving learnability. These findings offer new
insights into the limitations of current representations and inform future
benchmark construction for attribute reasoning.

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to quantitatively evaluate 3D models generated by large language models (LLMs) using a human-in-the-loop framework, emphasizing metrics for geometric and structural fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods to evaluate 3D shapes generated by LLMs lack robustness, particularly in geometric and structural accuracy, impeding applications like CAD design democratization and rapid prototyping.

Method: The authors propose a human-in-the-loop framework featuring a suite of similarity and complexity metrics (e.g., volumetric accuracy, surface alignment) to quantitatively benchmark 3D models against ground truth CAD designs. LLMs are tested on an L-bracket across four input formats.

Result: The study reveals that LLM performance improves with semantically richer inputs, with code-based prompts achieving perfect fidelity in all metrics. The framework allows faster and more reliable model convergence compared to traditional qualitative evaluations.

Conclusion: This quantitative evaluation framework enhances AI-assisted 3D model generation, speeding convergence to the ground truth and offering a scalable validation approach for CAD applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly capable of interpreting multimodal
inputs to generate complex 3D shapes, yet robust methods to evaluate geometric
and structural fidelity remain underdeveloped. This paper introduces a human in
the loop framework for the quantitative evaluation of LLM generated 3D models,
supporting applications such as democratization of CAD design, reverse
engineering of legacy designs, and rapid prototyping. We propose a
comprehensive suite of similarity and complexity metrics, including volumetric
accuracy, surface alignment, dimensional fidelity, and topological intricacy,
to benchmark generated models against ground truth CAD references. Using an L
bracket component as a case study, we systematically compare LLM performance
across four input modalities: 2D orthographic views, isometric sketches,
geometric structure trees, and code based correction prompts. Our findings
demonstrate improved generation fidelity with increased semantic richness, with
code level prompts achieving perfect reconstruction across all metrics. A key
contribution of this work is demonstrating that our proposed quantitative
evaluation approach enables significantly faster convergence toward the ground
truth, especially compared to traditional qualitative methods based solely on
visual inspection and human intuition. This work not only advances the
understanding of AI assisted shape synthesis but also provides a scalable
methodology to validate and refine generative models for diverse CAD
applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MEGS², a memory-efficient framework for reducing the high memory consumption of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) in novel-view synthesis, achieving significant memory compression during rendering without sacrificing quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is efficient for novel-view synthesis but has high memory demands, making it unsuitable for edge devices. Current compression methods mainly focus on storage issues and fail to tackle rendering memory bottlenecks.

Method: MEGS² reduces memory by optimizing the total primitive number and parameters per primitive. It introduces lightweight spherical Gaussian lobes for color representation and a unified pruning framework that integrates primitive-number and lobe-number optimization as a constrained problem.

Result: MEGS² achieves a 50% static VRAM reduction and a 40% rendering VRAM reduction compared to existing methods, maintaining rendering quality.

Conclusion: MEGS² establishes an effective approach to significantly compress the memory requirements of 3DGS during rendering, making it more suitable for memory-constrained devices while retaining high-quality output.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a dominant novel-view synthesis
technique, but its high memory consumption severely limits its applicability on
edge devices. A growing number of 3DGS compression methods have been proposed
to make 3DGS more efficient, yet most only focus on storage compression and
fail to address the critical bottleneck of rendering memory. To address this
problem, we introduce MEGS$^{2}$, a novel memory-efficient framework that
tackles this challenge by jointly optimizing two key factors: the total
primitive number and the parameters per primitive, achieving unprecedented
memory compression. Specifically, we replace the memory-intensive spherical
harmonics with lightweight arbitrarily-oriented spherical Gaussian lobes as our
color representations. More importantly, we propose a unified soft pruning
framework that models primitive-number and lobe-number pruning as a single
constrained optimization problem. Experiments show that MEGS$^{2}$ achieves a
50% static VRAM reduction and a 40% rendering VRAM reduction compared to
existing methods, while maintaining comparable rendering quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel regularization loss encouraging samples to follow a standard Gaussian distribution, which benefits latent space optimization in text-to-image models for improved aesthetics and text alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing downstream tasks involving latent space optimization in text-to-image generative models by effectively regularizing Gaussianity.

Method: Combines moment-based regularization in spatial domain and power spectrum-based regularization in spectral domain while ensuring permutation invariance through random input permutations.

Result: Introduced regularization outperforms previous Gaussianity-based approaches, avoiding reward hacking, accelerating convergence, and achieving improved generative modeling for reward alignment.

Conclusion: The proposed regularization loss is computationally efficient and surpasses existing methods, opening avenues for better generative modeling particularly in aesthetic and text alignment tasks.

Abstract: We propose a novel regularization loss that enforces standard Gaussianity,
encouraging samples to align with a standard Gaussian distribution. This
facilitates a range of downstream tasks involving optimization in the latent
space of text-to-image models. We treat elements of a high-dimensional sample
as one-dimensional standard Gaussian variables and define a composite loss that
combines moment-based regularization in the spatial domain with power
spectrum-based regularization in the spectral domain. Since the expected values
of moments and power spectrum distributions are analytically known, the loss
promotes conformity to these properties. To ensure permutation invariance, the
losses are applied to randomly permuted inputs. Notably, existing
Gaussianity-based regularizations fall within our unified framework: some
correspond to moment losses of specific orders, while the previous
covariance-matching loss is equivalent to our spectral loss but incurs higher
time complexity due to its spatial-domain computation. We showcase the
application of our regularization in generative modeling for test-time reward
alignment with a text-to-image model, specifically to enhance aesthetics and
text alignment. Our regularization outperforms previous Gaussianity
regularization, effectively prevents reward hacking and accelerates
convergence.

TL;DR: Paper presents a reward function-based optimization approach to improve the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for real-time microscopy image segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate and adaptable image segmentation is crucial in microscopy, particularly for real-time analysis of complex visual data.

Method: Incorporating reward functions that embody physical parameters (e.g., particle size, geometry) to fine-tune SAM and create an optimized version, SAM$^{*}$.

Result: Enhanced SAM performance and adaptability demonstrated with optimized segmentation for diverse microscopy tasks.

Conclusion: Reward-driven optimization addresses limitations of foundational models, improving their applicability for real-time data analysis in microscopy.

Abstract: Image segmentation is a critical task in microscopy, essential for accurately
analyzing and interpreting complex visual data. This task can be performed
using custom models trained on domain-specific datasets, transfer learning from
pre-trained models, or foundational models that offer broad applicability.
However, foundational models often present a considerable number of
non-transparent tuning parameters that require extensive manual optimization,
limiting their usability for real-time streaming data analysis. Here, we
introduce a reward function-based optimization to fine-tune foundational models
and illustrate this approach for SAM (Segment Anything Model) framework by
Meta. The reward functions can be constructed to represent the physics of the
imaged system, including particle size distributions, geometries, and other
criteria. By integrating a reward-driven optimization framework, we enhance
SAM's adaptability and performance, leading to an optimized variant, SAM$^{*}$,
that better aligns with the requirements of diverse segmentation tasks and
particularly allows for real-time streaming data segmentation. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of this approach in microscopy imaging, where precise
segmentation is crucial for analyzing cellular structures, material interfaces,
and nanoscale features.

### [88] [Automated Evaluation of Gender Bias Across 13 Large Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07050)
*Juan Manuel Contreras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a benchmark, Aymara Image Fairness Evaluation, to study gender bias in 13 large multimodal models and reveals amplified occupational gender stereotypes in AI-generated images, along with varying levels of bias across models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the methodological limitations in analyzing gender bias in large multimodal models and introduce a standardized benchmark for assessment.

Method: Developed a benchmark with 75 gender-neutral prompts and used AI to analyze 965 images generated by 13 LMMs for gender representation.

Result: Findings display amplified gender stereotypes relative to real-world labor data, a strong default-male bias, and wide variability in bias across models.

Conclusion: Gender bias in LMMs is largely influenced by design choices, and standardized tools are essential for evaluating and promoting fairness in AI systems.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have revolutionized text-to-image generation,
but they risk perpetuating the harmful social biases in their training data.
Prior work has identified gender bias in these models, but methodological
limitations prevented large-scale, comparable, cross-model analysis. To address
this gap, we introduce the Aymara Image Fairness Evaluation, a benchmark for
assessing social bias in AI-generated images. We test 13 commercially available
LMMs using 75 procedurally-generated, gender-neutral prompts to generate people
in stereotypically-male, stereotypically-female, and non-stereotypical
professions. We then use a validated LLM-as-a-judge system to score the 965
resulting images for gender representation. Our results reveal (p < .001 for
all): 1) LMMs systematically not only reproduce but actually amplify
occupational gender stereotypes relative to real-world labor data, generating
men in 93.0% of images for male-stereotyped professions but only 22.5% for
female-stereotyped professions; 2) Models exhibit a strong default-male bias,
generating men in 68.3% of the time for non-stereotyped professions; and 3) The
extent of bias varies dramatically across models, with overall male
representation ranging from 46.7% to 73.3%. Notably, the top-performing model
de-amplified gender stereotypes and approached gender parity, achieving the
highest fairness scores. This variation suggests high bias is not an inevitable
outcome but a consequence of design choices. Our work provides the most
comprehensive cross-model benchmark of gender bias to date and underscores the
necessity of standardized, automated evaluation tools for promoting
accountability and fairness in AI development.

### [89] [Faster VGGT with Block-Sparse Global Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07120)
*Chung-Shien Brian Wang,Christian Schmidt,Jens Piekenbrinck,Bastian Leibe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study addresses the inefficiency of transformer-based models for multi-view reconstruction, introducing block-sparse attention to improve scalability and inference speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the runtime bottleneck in transformer-based models like VGGT and π^3 caused by the quadratic complexity of global attention layers.

Method: Use optimized block-sparse attention kernels to replace dense global attention layers without retraining the backbone.

Result: Achieved up to 4x faster inference while maintaining comparable performance on multi-view reconstruction tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed block-sparse attention approach improves scalability and efficiency, allowing the models to handle larger image collections effectively.

Abstract: Efficient and accurate feed-forward multi-view reconstruction has long been
an important task in computer vision. Recent transformer-based models like VGGT
and $\pi^3$ have achieved impressive results with simple architectures, yet
they face an inherent runtime bottleneck, due to the quadratic complexity of
the global attention layers, that limits the scalability to large image sets.
In this paper, we empirically analyze the global attention matrix of these
models and observe that probability mass concentrates on a small subset of
patch-patch interactions that correspond to cross-view geometric matches.
Motivated by the structured attention and inspired by recent advancement in
large language models, we propose a replacement for the dense global attention
operation based on highly optimized block-sparse kernels, yielding up to
$4\times$ faster inference with comparable task performance. Our retrofit
requires no retraining of the backbone, extends to both VGGT and $\pi^3$, and
supports large image collections. Evaluations on a comprehensive suite of
multi-view benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

*Soruya Saha,Md Nurul Absur,Saptarshi Debroy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses pose spoofing attacks in offloaded Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) for Virtual Reality using a detection and recovery mechanism based on temporal motion regularities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the threat of server-side pose spoofing in offloaded Visual-Inertial Odometry systems for Virtual Reality, which can result in substantial pose drift and compromised immersive experience.

Method: Development of an unsupervised, label-free mechanism that detects runtime deviations in motion using temporal regularities, followed by recovery actions to restore pose consistency. The model is trained on attack-free sessions.

Result: Simulation experiments on the ILLIXR testbed showed significant reductions in trajectory and pose errors under various spoofing intensities compared to a baseline without defense mechanisms.

Conclusion: The proposed mechanism effectively mitigates pose spoofing attacks in offloaded VIO, improving robustness and security for Virtual Reality systems.

Abstract: Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) supports immersive Virtual Reality (VR) by
fusing camera and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data for real-time pose.
However, current trend of offloading VIO to edge servers can lead server-side
threat surface where subtle pose spoofing can accumulate into substantial
drift, while evading heuristic checks. In this paper, we study this threat and
present an unsupervised, label-free detection and recovery mechanism. The
proposed model is trained on attack-free sessions to learn temporal
regularities of motion to detect runtime deviations and initiate recovery to
restore pose consistency. We evaluate the approach in a realistic offloaded-VIO
environment using ILLIXR testbed across multiple spoofing intensities.
Experimental results in terms of well-known performance metrics show
substantial reductions in trajectory and pose error compared to a no-defense
baseline.

### [91] [Realism to Deception: Investigating Deepfake Detectors Against Face Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07178)
*Muhammad Saad Saeed,Ijaz Ul Haq,Khalid Malik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Face enhancement techniques can reduce deepfake detector accuracy, posing anti-forensic risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how face enhancement techniques impact the accuracy of deepfake detectors and serve as potential anti-forensic tools.

Method: Evaluated both traditional image processing methods and GAN-based enhancement techniques, analyzed detection methods (Naïve, Spatial, Frequency-based), and conducted adversarial training experiments.

Result: Basic enhancement filters reduce detection accuracy (ASR up to 64.63%), while GAN-based techniques achieve reductions up to 75.12%.

Conclusion: Face enhancement methods can act as anti-forensic tools, highlighting the need for improved forensic robustness.

Abstract: Face enhancement techniques are widely used to enhance facial appearance.
However, they can inadvertently distort biometric features, leading to
significant decrease in the accuracy of deepfake detectors. This study
hypothesizes that these techniques, while improving perceptual quality, can
degrade the performance of deepfake detectors. To investigate this, we
systematically evaluate whether commonly used face enhancement methods can
serve an anti-forensic role by reducing detection accuracy. We use both
traditional image processing methods and advanced GAN-based enhancements to
evaluate the robustness of deepfake detectors. We provide a comprehensive
analysis of the effectiveness of these enhancement techniques, focusing on
their impact on Na\"ive, Spatial, and Frequency-based detection methods.
Furthermore, we conduct adversarial training experiments to assess whether
exposure to face enhancement transformations improves model robustness.
Experiments conducted on the FaceForensics++, DeepFakeDetection, and CelebDF-v2
datasets indicate that even basic enhancement filters can significantly reduce
detection accuracy achieving ASR up to 64.63\%. In contrast, GAN-based
techniques further exploit these vulnerabilities, achieving ASR up to 75.12\%.
Our results demonstrate that face enhancement methods can effectively function
as anti-forensic tools, emphasizing the need for more resilient and adaptive
forensic methods.

*Erencem Ozbey,Dimitrios I. Diochnos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a fully unsupervised method using Vision Transformers and manifold learning for novel class discovery and clustering in image datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Labeling data is human-intensive, and novel categories often emerge, especially in 'open-world' settings, making traditional supervised methods insufficient for long-term use.

Method: The authors use Vision Transformers to embed data vectors with attention mechanisms and refine those embeddings using manifold learning to better capture data's intrinsic geometry.

Result: Their approach achieves state-of-the-art results on single-modal clustering and novel class discovery across datasets including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and Tiny ImageNet.

Conclusion: The proposed unsupervised method can effectively identify novel categories and improve clustering performance, even when the number of clusters is unknown.

Abstract: Working with annotated data is the cornerstone of supervised learning.
Nevertheless, providing labels to instances is a task that requires significant
human effort. Several critical real-world applications make things more
complicated because no matter how many labels may have been identified in a
task of interest, it could be the case that examples corresponding to novel
classes may appear in the future. Not unsurprisingly, prior work in this,
so-called, `open-world' context has focused a lot on semi-supervised
approaches.
  Focusing on image classification, somehow paradoxically, we propose a fully
unsupervised approach to the problem of determining the novel categories in a
particular dataset. Our approach relies on estimating the number of clusters
using Vision Transformers, which utilize attention mechanisms to generate
vector embeddings. Furthermore, we incorporate manifold learning techniques to
refine these embeddings by exploiting the intrinsic geometry of the data,
thereby enhancing the overall image clustering performance. Overall, we
establish new State-of-the-Art results on single-modal clustering and Novel
Class Discovery on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and Tiny ImageNet. We do
so, both when the number of clusters is known or unknown ahead of time. The

### [93] [XBusNet: Text-Guided Breast Ultrasound Segmentation via Multimodal Vision-Language Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07213)
*Raja Mallina,Bryar Shareef*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces XBusNet, a model improving breast ultrasound segmentation by combining image and text features, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Breast ultrasound segmentation is challenging due to small or low-contrast lesions with fuzzy margins and noise, requiring an improved approach for precision and robustness.

Method: The authors developed XBusNet, a dual-prompt, dual-branch multimodal model using CLIP Vision Transformer and U-Net pathways, incorporating text prompts derived from structured metadata.

Result: XBusNet outperforms six baselines on the BLU dataset with a mean Dice score of 0.8765 and IoU of 0.8149, especially benefiting small lesion segmentation.

Conclusion: The dual-prompt, dual-branch design effectively combines global context and local precision, improving segmentation accuracy and robustness in BUS imaging.

Abstract: Background: Precise breast ultrasound (BUS) segmentation supports reliable
measurement, quantitative analysis, and downstream classification, yet remains
difficult for small or low-contrast lesions with fuzzy margins and speckle
noise. Text prompts can add clinical context, but directly applying weakly
localized text-image cues (e.g., CAM/CLIP-derived signals) tends to produce
coarse, blob-like responses that smear boundaries unless additional mechanisms
recover fine edges. Methods: We propose XBusNet, a novel dual-prompt,
dual-branch multimodal model that combines image features with clinically
grounded text. A global pathway based on a CLIP Vision Transformer encodes
whole-image semantics conditioned on lesion size and location, while a local
U-Net pathway emphasizes precise boundaries and is modulated by prompts that
describe shape, margin, and Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS)
terms. Prompts are assembled automatically from structured metadata, requiring
no manual clicks. We evaluate on the Breast Lesions USG (BLU) dataset using
five-fold cross-validation. Primary metrics are Dice and Intersection over
Union (IoU); we also conduct size-stratified analyses and ablations to assess
the roles of the global and local paths and the text-driven modulation.
Results: XBusNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on BLU, with mean Dice
of 0.8765 and IoU of 0.8149, outperforming six strong baselines. Small lesions
show the largest gains, with fewer missed regions and fewer spurious
activations. Ablation studies show complementary contributions of global
context, local boundary modeling, and prompt-based modulation. Conclusions: A
dual-prompt, dual-branch multimodal design that merges global semantics with
local precision yields accurate BUS segmentation masks and improves robustness
for small, low-contrast lesions.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework combining Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPM) for data augmentation and feature fusion for accurate breast cancer classification in thermograms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address data scarcity in deep learning for medical imaging, specifically in breast cancer classification using thermograms.

Method: A framework combining DPM-based data augmentation with feature fusion using deep learning (ResNet-50) and handcrafted nonlinear features, which were then utilized to train an XGBoost classifier.

Result: Achieved 98.0% accuracy and 98.1% sensitivity, with ablation studies confirming the significance of DPM augmentation and nonlinear feature fusion.

Conclusion: The integration of advanced generative models with interpretable features enables highly accurate diagnostic tools for medical imaging.

Abstract: Data scarcity hinders deep learning for medical imaging. We propose a
framework for breast cancer classification in thermograms that addresses this
using a Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DPM) for data augmentation. Our
DPM-based augmentation is shown to be superior to both traditional methods and
a ProGAN baseline. The framework fuses deep features from a pre-trained
ResNet-50 with handcrafted nonlinear features (e.g., Fractal Dimension) derived
from U-Net segmented tumors. An XGBoost classifier trained on these fused
features achieves 98.0\% accuracy and 98.1\% sensitivity. Ablation studies and
statistical tests confirm that both the DPM augmentation and the nonlinear
feature fusion are critical, statistically significant components of this
success. This work validates the synergy between advanced generative models and
interpretable features for creating highly accurate medical diagnostic tools.

### [95] [Reconstruction Alignment Improves Unified Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07295)
*Ji Xie,Trevor Darrell,Luke Zettlemoyer,XuDong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents Reconstruction Alignment (RecA), a post-training method for Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) that improves image generation and editing by using visual embeddings as dense prompts without relying on captions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional training of UMMs depends on sparse image-text pairs that lack fine-grained visual details, resulting in suboptimal performance for unified visual understanding and generation.

Method: RecA uses a UMM's visual understanding embeddings as dense prompts and applies a self-supervised reconstruction loss. It realigns the understanding and generation capabilities of the UMM by optimizing it to reconstruct input images.

Result: RecA significantly enhances image generation and editing. For example, it improves metrics such as GenEval (0.73→0.90) and DPGBench (80.93→88.15) while requiring only minimal computational resources (27 GPU-hours).

Conclusion: RecA is an efficient, broadly compatible post-training strategy for UMMs, surpassing larger open-source models and improving multiple benchmarks in image generation and editing tasks.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models (UMMs) unify visual understanding and generation
within a single architecture. However, conventional training relies on
image-text pairs (or sequences) whose captions are typically sparse and miss
fine-grained visual details--even when they use hundreds of words to describe a
simple image. We introduce Reconstruction Alignment (RecA), a
resource-efficient post-training method that leverages visual understanding
encoder embeddings as dense "text prompts," providing rich supervision without
captions. Concretely, RecA conditions a UMM on its own visual understanding
embeddings and optimizes it to reconstruct the input image with a
self-supervised reconstruction loss, thereby realigning understanding and
generation. Despite its simplicity, RecA is broadly applicable: across
autoregressive, masked-autoregressive, and diffusion-based UMMs, it
consistently improves generation and editing fidelity. With only 27 GPU-hours,
post-training with RecA substantially improves image generation performance on
GenEval (0.73$\rightarrow$0.90) and DPGBench (80.93$\rightarrow$88.15), while
also boosting editing benchmarks (ImgEdit 3.38$\rightarrow$3.75, GEdit
6.94$\rightarrow$7.25). Notably, RecA surpasses much larger open-source models
and applies broadly across diverse UMM architectures, establishing it as an
efficient and general post-training alignment strategy for UMMs

*Shucong Li,Zhenyu Liu,Zijie Hong,Zhiheng Zhou,Xianghai Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DEPF, a multispectral object detector using dual-domain enhancement and priority-guided fusion to address challenges in UAV imaging, excelling on DroneVehicle and VEDAI datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in multispectral remote sensing object detection for UAVs include low-light imaging issues, interference in local small target modeling, and high computational complexity of transformer-based methods.

Method: The proposed DEPF uses Dual-Domain Enhancement Module (CSWM and FDR) for image enhancement and Priority-Guided Mamba Fusion Module for target-focused data fusion.

Result: Experiments on DroneVehicle and VEDAI datasets show that DEPF outperforms state-of-the-art methods in UAV multispectral object detection.

Conclusion: DEPF effectively addresses the limitations of UAV multispectral object detection, combining efficient image enhancement and improved fusion strategies for better performance.

Abstract: Multispectral remote sensing object detection is one of the important
application of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). However, it faces three
challenges. Firstly, the low-light remote sensing images reduce the
complementarity during multi-modality fusion. Secondly, the local small target
modeling is interfered with redundant information in the fusion stage easily.
Thirdly, due to the quadratic computational complexity, it is hard to apply the
transformer-based methods on the UAV platform. To address these limitations,
motivated by Mamba with linear complexity, a UAV multispectral object detector
with dual-domain enhancement and priority-guided mamba fusion (DEPF) is
proposed. Firstly, to enhance low-light remote sensing images, Dual-Domain
Enhancement Module (DDE) is designed, which contains Cross-Scale Wavelet Mamba
(CSWM) and Fourier Details Recovery block (FDR). CSWM applies cross-scale mamba
scanning for the low-frequency components to enhance the global brightness of
images, while FDR constructs spectrum recovery network to enhance the frequency
spectra features for recovering the texture-details. Secondly, to enhance local
target modeling and reduce the impact of redundant information during fusion,
Priority-Guided Mamba Fusion Module (PGMF) is designed. PGMF introduces the
concept of priority scanning, which starts from local targets features
according to the priority scores obtained from modality difference. Experiments
on DroneVehicle dataset and VEDAI dataset reports that, DEPF performs well on
object detection, comparing with state-of-the-art methods. Our code is
available in the supplementary material.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces G$^{3}$CN, a new graph convolutional network variant using Gaussian and gated mechanisms to address issues in skeleton-based action recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GCNs excel in skeleton-based action recognition but struggle with differentiating ambiguous actions.

Method: The approach refines graph topologies using a Gaussian filter and integrates GRUs into the GCN framework for better information propagation.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmarks NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA show improved performance in action recognition, especially for ambiguous cases.

Conclusion: The proposed G$^{3}$CN method enhances the ability to recognize actions reliably, showcasing better generalization and refinement of features.

Abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have proven to be highly effective for
skeleton-based action recognition, primarily due to their ability to leverage
graph topology for feature aggregation, a key factor in extracting meaningful
representations. However, despite their success, GCNs often struggle to
effectively distinguish between ambiguous actions, revealing limitations in the
representation of learned topological and spatial features. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel approach, Gaussian Topology Refinement Gated
Graph Convolution (G$^{3}$CN), to address the challenge of distinguishing
ambiguous actions in skeleton-based action recognition. G$^{3}$CN incorporates
a Gaussian filter to refine the skeleton topology graph, improving the
representation of ambiguous actions. Additionally, Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)
are integrated into the GCN framework to enhance information propagation
between skeleton points. Our method shows strong generalization across various
GCN backbones. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA
benchmarks demonstrate that G$^{3}$CN effectively improves action recognition,
particularly for ambiguous samples.

*Shibang Liu,Xuemei Xie,Guangming Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Parse Graph-based Visual-Language interaction (PGVL), using guided modules for enhanced human pose estimation by combining visual and language modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches in human pose estimation have ignored the potential of integrating visual and language modalities, specifically the rich priors that language can provide for handling occlusion challenges.

Method: The proposed PGVL framework uses a guided module (GM) that incorporates top-down and bottom-up processing. It includes modality-specific parse graph construction and recursive bidirectional cross-attention enhanced by the GM to maintain local feature responses and refine fusion.

Result: PGVL demonstrates improved pose estimation performance, validated on major datasets, showcasing its ability to better handle occlusion and alignment challenges.

Conclusion: The PGVL framework offers an effective solution to integrate multimodal information for human pose estimation, addressing key limitations in occlusion handling and feature alignment through innovative guided modules and graph-based modeling.

Abstract: Parse graphs boost human pose estimation (HPE) by integrating context and
hierarchies, yet prior work mostly focuses on single modality modeling,
ignoring the potential of multimodal fusion. Notably, language offers rich HPE
priors like spatial relations for occluded scenes, but existing visual-language
fusion via global feature integration weakens occluded region responses and
causes alignment and location failures. To address this issue, we propose Parse
Graph-based Visual-Language interaction (PGVL) with a core novel Guided Module
(GM). In PGVL, low-level nodes focus on local features, maximizing the
maintenance of responses in occluded areas and high-level nodes integrate
global features to infer occluded or invisible parts. GM enables high semantic
nodes to guide the feature update of low semantic nodes that have undergone
cross attention. It ensuring effective fusion of diverse information. PGVL
includes top-down decomposition and bottom-up composition. In the first stage,
modality specific parse graphs are constructed. Next stage. recursive
bidirectional cross-attention is used, purified by GM. We also design network
based on PGVL. The PGVL and our network is validated on major pose estimation
datasets. We will release the code soon.

*Ze-Xin Yin,Jiaxiong Qiu,Liu Liu,Xinjie Wang,Wei Sui,Zhizhong Su,Jian Yang,Jin Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lightweight Gaussian Asset Adapter (LGAA) is a novel framework enabling end-to-end modeling of 3D geometry and physically-based rendering (PBR) materials using multi-view diffusion priors, leading to efficient and high-quality 3D asset generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The laborious and expertise-driven process of creating 3D assets with physically-based rendering materials highlights the need for an autonomous system capable of end-to-end 3D asset generation, combining geometry and PBR material synthesis.

Method: LGAA integrates a modular design consisting of: (1) LGAA Wrapper, which reuses layers from multi-view diffusion models; (2) LGAA Switcher, aligning multiple diffusion priors for geometry and material synthesis; (3) LGAA Decoder, a variational autoencoder predicting 2D Gaussian Splatting with PBR channels, complemented by post-processing for relightable mesh extraction.

Result: Experiments demonstrate LGAA’s superior performance in generating high-quality 3D assets under text and image conditioning. Its modular and knowledge-preserving design also supports efficient data utilization, achieving convergence with only 69k multi-view instances.

Conclusion: LGAA revolutionizes the 3D asset generation pipeline by unifying geometry and PBR synthesis, leveraging advanced multi-view diffusion models, and ensuring efficiency. The framework shows great promise in streamlining workflows for the 3D content creation industry.

Abstract: The labor- and experience-intensive creation of 3D assets with physically
based rendering (PBR) materials demands an autonomous 3D asset creation
pipeline. However, most existing 3D generation methods focus on geometry
modeling, either baking textures into simple vertex colors or leaving texture
synthesis to post-processing with image diffusion models. To achieve end-to-end
PBR-ready 3D asset generation, we present Lightweight Gaussian Asset Adapter
(LGAA), a novel framework that unifies the modeling of geometry and PBR
materials by exploiting multi-view (MV) diffusion priors from a novel
perspective. The LGAA features a modular design with three components.
Specifically, the LGAA Wrapper reuses and adapts network layers from MV
diffusion models, which encapsulate knowledge acquired from billions of images,
enabling better convergence in a data-efficient manner. To incorporate multiple
diffusion priors for geometry and PBR synthesis, the LGAA Switcher aligns
multiple LGAA Wrapper layers encapsulating different knowledge. Then, a tamed
variational autoencoder (VAE), termed LGAA Decoder, is designed to predict 2D
Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) with PBR channels. Finally, we introduce a dedicated
post-processing procedure to effectively extract high-quality, relightable mesh
assets from the resulting 2DGS. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of LGAA with both text-and
image-conditioned MV diffusion models. Additionally, the modular design enables
flexible incorporation of multiple diffusion priors, and the
knowledge-preserving scheme leads to efficient convergence trained on merely
69k multi-view instances. Our code, pre-trained weights, and the dataset used
will be publicly available via our project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy of forest carbon stock assessment techniques using integrated ground and satellite monitoring methods.

Method: The authors employed GF-1 WFV and Landsat TM images, utilizing a Swin Transformer-based style transfer method for global feature extraction via attention mechanisms.

Result: The research converts carbon stock estimation into an image translation task, leveraging advanced machine learning methodologies.

Conclusion: Innovative techniques like style transfer and Swin Transformer show promise in enhancing carbon stock estimation accuracy, relevant for climate change mitigation.

Abstract: Forests function as crucial carbon reservoirs on land, and their carbon sinks
can efficiently reduce atmospheric CO2 concentrations and mitigate climate
change. Currently, the overall trend for monitoring and assessing forest carbon
stocks is to integrate ground monitoring sample data with satellite remote
sensing imagery. This style of analysis facilitates large-scale observation.
However, these techniques require improvement in accuracy. We used GF-1 WFV and
Landsat TM images to analyze Huize County, Qujing City, Yunnan Province in
China. Using the style transfer method, we introduced Swin Transformer to
extract global features through attention mechanisms, converting the carbon
stock estimation into an image translation.

TL;DR: The paper presents EgoGazeVQA, a benchmark utilizing gaze information for better video understanding and personalized AI through multimodal large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the capability of AI assistants in understanding user intent and actions in egocentric videos, particularly by leveraging gaze information.

Method: The authors introduced a gaze-guided video question answering benchmark with QA pairs generated by MLLMs and refined by humans while developing gaze-intent prompting methods for improved model performance.

Result: The gaze-guided prompting methods significantly improved the model's ability to interpret intent, demonstrating the impact of spatial, temporal, and intent cues. Additional experiments showed that gaze estimation accuracy is crucial.

Conclusion: Incorporating gaze information substantially improves AI understanding in egocentric scenarios, highlighting its potential for more personalized and effective assistants.

Abstract: The emergence of advanced multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has
significantly enhanced AI assistants' ability to process complex information
across modalities. Recently, egocentric videos, by directly capturing user
focus, actions, and context in an unified coordinate, offer an exciting
opportunity to enable proactive and personalized AI user experiences with
MLLMs. However, existing benchmarks overlook the crucial role of gaze as an
indicator of user intent. To address this gap, we introduce EgoGazeVQA, an
egocentric gaze-guided video question answering benchmark that leverages gaze
information to improve the understanding of longer daily-life videos.
EgoGazeVQA consists of gaze-based QA pairs generated by MLLMs and refined by
human annotators. Our experiments reveal that existing MLLMs struggle to
accurately interpret user intentions. In contrast, our gaze-guided intent
prompting methods significantly enhance performance by integrating spatial,
temporal, and intent-related cues. We further conduct experiments on
gaze-related fine-tuning and analyze how gaze estimation accuracy impacts
prompting effectiveness. These results underscore the value of gaze for more
personalized and effective AI assistants in egocentric settings.

Result: GLEAM-C achieves comparable accuracy to prior models while improving training efficiency, and GLEAM-X supports explainable reasoning for cross-view geo-localization tasks using refined bilingual benchmarks.

Conclusion: GLEAM-C and GLEAM-X together unify cross-view matching with interpretability, advancing geo-localization accuracy, transparency, and scalability.

Abstract: Cross-View Geo-Localization (CVGL) focuses on identifying correspondences
between images captured from distinct perspectives of the same geographical
location. However, existing CVGL approaches are typically restricted to a
single view or modality, and their direct visual matching strategy lacks
interpretability: they merely predict whether two images correspond, without
explaining the rationale behind the match. In this paper, we present GLEAM-C, a
foundational CVGL model that unifies multiple views and modalities-including
UAV imagery, street maps, panoramic views, and ground photographs-by aligning
them exclusively with satellite imagery. Our framework enhances training
efficiency through optimized implementation while achieving accuracy comparable
to prior modality-specific CVGL models through a two-phase training strategy.
Moreover, to address the lack of interpretability in traditional CVGL methods,
we leverage the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) to propose a new task, GLEAM-X, which combines cross-view
correspondence prediction with explainable reasoning. To support this task, we
construct a bilingual benchmark using GPT-4o and Doubao-1.5-Thinking-Vision-Pro
to generate training and testing data. The test set is further refined through
detailed human revision, enabling systematic evaluation of explainable
cross-view reasoning and advancing transparency and scalability in
geo-localization. Together, GLEAM-C and GLEAM-X form a comprehensive CVGL
pipeline that integrates multi-modal, multi-view alignment with interpretable
correspondence analysis, unifying accurate cross-view matching with explainable
reasoning and advancing Geo-Localization by enabling models to better Explain
And Match. Code and datasets used in this work will be made publicly accessible

### [103] [XOCT: Enhancing OCT to OCTA Translation via Cross-Dimensional Supervised Multi-Scale Feature Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07455)
*Pooya Khosravi,Kun Han,Anthony T. Wu,Arghavan Rezvani,Zexin Feng,Xiaohui Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XOCT is a novel deep learning framework designed to improve OCT-to-OCTA translation, enabling accurate reconstruction of retinal vascular details for better retinal disease diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges like motion sensitivity, high costs of OCTA imaging, and the inability of existing deep learning methods to accurately reconstruct vascular complexities across retinal layers.

Method: XOCT incorporates Cross-Dimensional Supervision (CDS) with Multi-Scale Feature Fusion (MSFF). CDS uses 2D layer-wise en-face projections for targeted retinal layer training. MSFF employs multi-scale feature extraction and channel reweighting for enhanced vessel delineation.

Result: XOCT demonstrated enhanced performance on the OCTA-500 dataset, particularly in improving the en-face projections critical for clinical diagnosis of retinal diseases.

Conclusion: XOCT advances OCTA image quality, making it a more accessible and reliable diagnostic tool for retinal and choroidal diseases, with its code available for broader adoption.

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) and its derived en-face
projections provide high-resolution visualization of the retinal and choroidal
vasculature, which is critical for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of retinal
diseases. However, acquiring high-quality OCTA images is challenging due to
motion sensitivity and the high costs associated with software modifications
for conventional OCT devices. Moreover, current deep learning methods for
OCT-to-OCTA translation often overlook the vascular differences across retinal
layers and struggle to reconstruct the intricate, dense vascular details
necessary for reliable diagnosis. To overcome these limitations, we propose
XOCT, a novel deep learning framework that integrates Cross-Dimensional
Supervision (CDS) with a Multi-Scale Feature Fusion (MSFF) network for
layer-aware vascular reconstruction. Our CDS module leverages 2D layer-wise
en-face projections, generated via segmentation-weighted z-axis averaging, as
supervisory signals to compel the network to learn distinct representations for
each retinal layer through fine-grained, targeted guidance. Meanwhile, the MSFF
module enhances vessel delineation through multi-scale feature extraction
combined with a channel reweighting strategy, effectively capturing vascular
details at multiple spatial scales. Our experiments on the OCTA-500 dataset
demonstrate XOCT's improvements, especially for the en-face projections which
are significant for clinical evaluation of retinal pathologies, underscoring
its potential to enhance OCTA accessibility, reliability, and diagnostic value
for ophthalmic disease detection and monitoring. The code is available at

*Sai Siddhartha Chary Aylapuram,Veeraraju Elluru,Shivang Agarwal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores Bias-Aware Machine Unlearning to address biases in vision models, achieving significant improvements in fairness across datasets while preserving accuracy and privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address biases in deep neural networks using post-hoc approaches, avoiding the need for retraining or redesigning data pipelines.

Method: Investigate bias mitigation through selective removal of biased samples or feature representations using Gradient Ascent, LoRA, and Teacher-Student distillation.

Result: Achieved substantial reductions in subgroup disparities on benchmarks (CUB-200, CIFAR-10, CelebA), improving demographic parity by up to 94.86%, 30.28%, and 97.37% respectively.

Conclusion: Machine unlearning provides a practical and effective framework for mitigating bias in deployed vision systems without full retraining, ensuring fairness and maintaining model utility.

Abstract: Deep neural networks often rely on spurious correlations in training data,
leading to biased or unfair predictions in safety-critical domains such as
medicine and autonomous driving. While conventional bias mitigation typically
requires retraining from scratch or redesigning data pipelines, recent advances
in machine unlearning provide a promising alternative for post-hoc model
correction. In this work, we investigate \textit{Bias-Aware Machine
Unlearning}, a paradigm that selectively removes biased samples or feature
representations to mitigate diverse forms of bias in vision models. Building on
privacy-preserving unlearning techniques, we evaluate various strategies
including Gradient Ascent, LoRA, and Teacher-Student distillation. Through
empirical analysis on three benchmark datasets, CUB-200-2011 (pose bias),
CIFAR-10 (synthetic patch bias), and CelebA (gender bias in smile detection),
we demonstrate that post-hoc unlearning can substantially reduce subgroup
disparities, with improvements in demographic parity of up to \textbf{94.86\%}
on CUB-200, \textbf{30.28\%} on CIFAR-10, and \textbf{97.37\%} on CelebA. These
gains are achieved with minimal accuracy loss and with methods scoring an
average of 0.62 across the 3 settings on the joint evaluation of utility,
fairness, quality, and privacy. Our findings establish machine unlearning as a
practical framework for enhancing fairness in deployed vision systems without
necessitating full retraining.

control over video details, limiting their practical applicability. We
introduce ANYPORTAL, a novel zero-shot framework for video background
replacement that leverages pre-trained diffusion models. Our framework
collaboratively integrates the temporal prior of video diffusion models with
the relighting capabilities of image diffusion models in a zero-shot setting.
To address the critical challenge of foreground consistency, we propose a
Refinement Projection Algorithm, which enables pixel-level detail manipulation
to ensure precise foreground preservation. ANYPORTAL is training-free and
overcomes the challenges of achieving foreground consistency and temporally
coherent relighting. Experimental results demonstrate that ANYPORTAL achieves
high-quality results on consumer-grade GPUs, offering a practical and efficient
solution for video content creation and editing.

TL;DR: MedicalPatchNet is a novel, interpretable deep learning model for chest X-ray classification that transparently attributes predictions to image patches, ensuring reliability without requiring post-hoc techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limited interpretability of deep neural networks in medical imaging, which hampers clinical trust despite high performance in image classification.

Method: MedicalPatchNet divides chest X-ray images into non-overlapping patches. Each patch is independently analyzed, and the results are aggregated to enable direct attribution of diagnostic importance to specific regions.

Result: MedicalPatchNet achieves comparable classification performance (AUROC 0.907) to EfficientNet-B0, while significantly improving interpretability and pathology localization accuracy (mean hit-rate 0.485 vs. 0.376).

Conclusion: MedicalPatchNet enhances clinical trust by providing detailed, reliable explanations of predictions, and its publicly available implementation encourages reproducible and safer AI diagnostics in medical imaging.

Abstract: Deep neural networks excel in radiological image classification but
frequently suffer from poor interpretability, limiting clinical acceptance. We
present MedicalPatchNet, an inherently self-explainable architecture for chest
X-ray classification that transparently attributes decisions to distinct image
regions. MedicalPatchNet splits images into non-overlapping patches,
independently classifies each patch, and aggregates predictions, enabling
intuitive visualization of each patch's diagnostic contribution without
post-hoc techniques. Trained on the CheXpert dataset (223,414 images),
MedicalPatchNet matches the classification performance (AUROC 0.907 vs. 0.908)
of EfficientNet-B0, while substantially improving interpretability:
MedicalPatchNet demonstrates substantially improved interpretability with
higher pathology localization accuracy (mean hit-rate 0.485 vs. 0.376 with
Grad-CAM) on the CheXlocalize dataset. By providing explicit, reliable
explanations accessible even to non-AI experts, MedicalPatchNet mitigates risks
associated with shortcut learning, thus improving clinical trust. Our model is
publicly available with reproducible training and inference scripts and
contributes to safer, explainable AI-assisted diagnostics across medical
imaging domains. We make the code publicly available:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method integrating implicit neural representations and text-to-video diffusion models to automate the animation of vector graphics, enabling smooth, vivid animations while preserving their inherent properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vector graphics are scalable and user-friendly but animating them often requires significant manual effort. Automating this process can enhance comprehensibility and accessibility.

Method: The method combines layered implicit neural representations to reconstruct vector graphics with video score distillation sampling from pretrained text-to-video diffusion models to optimize motion priors.

Result: The approach achieves vivid and natural vector graphic animations, overcoming existing limitations in flexibility and animation quality.

Conclusion: The proposed method demonstrates a significant improvement in automated vector graphic animation, making it more efficient and producing high-quality results.

Abstract: Vector graphics, known for their scalability and user-friendliness, provide a
unique approach to visual content compared to traditional pixel-based images.
Animation of these graphics, driven by the motion of their elements, offers
enhanced comprehensibility and controllability but often requires substantial
manual effort. To automate this process, we propose a novel method that
integrates implicit neural representations with text-to-video diffusion models
for vector graphic animation. Our approach employs layered implicit neural
representations to reconstruct vector graphics, preserving their inherent
properties such as infinite resolution and precise color and shape constraints,
which effectively bridges the large domain gap between vector graphics and
diffusion models. The neural representations are then optimized using video
score distillation sampling, which leverages motion priors from pretrained
text-to-video diffusion models. Finally, the vector graphics are warped to
match the representations resulting in smooth animation. Experimental results
validate the effectiveness of our method in generating vivid and natural vector
graphic animations, demonstrating significant improvement over existing
techniques that suffer from limitations in flexibility and animation quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assist visually impaired individuals with effective indoor navigation, overcoming limitations of conventional location-based systems.

Method: Fine-tuning the BLIP-2 model with Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on manually annotated indoor navigation datasets. Proposal of an improved evaluation metric emphasizing directional and sequential variables.

Result: The LoRA-applied BLIP-2 model shows significant improvements in generating accurate and directional instructions for indoor navigation.

Conclusion: Integrating vision-language models fine-tuned with LoRA enhances the accessibility and efficiency of indoor navigation systems for visually impaired users.

Abstract: We address vision-language-driven indoor navigation to assist visually
impaired individuals in reaching a target location using images and natural
language guidance. Traditional navigation systems are ineffective indoors due
to the lack of precise location data. Our approach integrates vision and
language models to generate step-by-step navigational instructions, enhancing
accessibility and independence. We fine-tune the BLIP-2 model with Low Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) on a manually annotated indoor navigation dataset. We propose
an evaluation metric that refines the BERT F1 score by emphasizing directional
and sequential variables, providing a more comprehensive measure of
navigational performance. After applying LoRA, the model significantly improved
in generating directional instructions, overcoming limitations in the original
BLIP-2 model.

*Wenzhi Guo,Bing Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces DiGS, incorporating Signed Distance Field (SDF) learning into 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to improve surface reconstruction and rendering fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While 3D Gaussian Splatting excels in photorealistic rendering, it struggles with accurate surface reconstruction due to the lack of structured representation and geometric supervision.

Method: DiGS integrates SDF learning into the 3DGS pipeline, aligning Gaussian primitives with scene geometry. It also employs a geometry-guided grid growth strategy for better Gaussian distribution.

Result: Experiments on benchmarks like DTU, Mip-NeRF 360, and Tanks & Temples show that DiGS enhances reconstruction accuracy and completeness while maintaining high-quality rendering.

Conclusion: DiGS successfully unifies surface reconstruction and rendering fidelity, making it a strong improvement to the 3DGS framework.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for
photorealistic view synthesis, representing scenes with spatially distributed
Gaussian primitives. While highly effective for rendering, achieving accurate
and complete surface reconstruction remains challenging due to the unstructured
nature of the representation and the absence of explicit geometric supervision.
In this work, we propose DiGS, a unified framework that embeds Signed Distance
Field (SDF) learning directly into the 3DGS pipeline, thereby enforcing strong
and interpretable surface priors. By associating each Gaussian with a learnable
SDF value, DiGS explicitly aligns primitives with underlying geometry and
improves cross-view consistency. To further ensure dense and coherent coverage,
we design a geometry-guided grid growth strategy that adaptively distributes
Gaussians along geometry-consistent regions under a multi-scale hierarchy.
Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, including DTU, Mip-NeRF 360, and
Tanks& Temples, demonstrate that DiGS consistently improves reconstruction
accuracy and completeness while retaining high rendering fidelity.

### [110] [Generating Transferrable Adversarial Examples via Local Mixing and Logits Optimization for Remote Sensing Object Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07495)
*Chun Liu,Hailong Wang,Bingqian Zhu,Panpan Ding,Zheng Zheng,Tao Xu,Zhigang Han,Jiayao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for improving adversarial attacks on deep neural networks using local mixing and logits optimization, resulting in higher attack success rates and enhanced transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome vulnerabilities in deep neural networks, particularly in remote sensing applications, by addressing limitations in existing adversarial attack strategies, such as global blending and gradient diminishing.

Method: The proposed method uses local mixing for generating diverse inputs, adapts logit loss to non-targeted scenarios for mitigating gradient vanishing, and incorporates a perturbation smoothing loss to reduce noise and improve transferability.

Result: Through experiments on FGSCR-42 and MTARSI datasets, the method shows superior performance, achieving a 17.28% gain in black-box attack success rate over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enhances the quality of adversarial examples, preserves semantic consistency, and improves robustness, paving the way for more secure remote sensing applications.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing
significant security threats to their deployment in remote sensing
applications. Research on adversarial attacks not only reveals model
vulnerabilities but also provides critical insights for enhancing robustness.
Although current mixing-based strategies have been proposed to increase the
transferability of adversarial examples, they either perform global blending or
directly exchange a region in the images, which may destroy global semantic
features and mislead the optimization of adversarial examples. Furthermore,
their reliance on cross-entropy loss for perturbation optimization leads to
gradient diminishing during iterative updates, compromising adversarial example
quality. To address these limitations, we focus on non-targeted attacks and
propose a novel framework via local mixing and logits optimization. First, we
present a local mixing strategy to generate diverse yet semantically consistent
inputs. Different from MixUp, which globally blends two images, and MixCut,
which stitches images together, our method merely blends local regions to
preserve global semantic information. Second, we adapt the logit loss from
targeted attacks to non-targeted scenarios, mitigating the gradient vanishing
problem of cross-entropy loss. Third, a perturbation smoothing loss is applied
to suppress high-frequency noise and enhance transferability. Extensive
experiments on FGSCR-42 and MTARSI datasets demonstrate superior performance
over 12 state-of-the-art methods across 6 surrogate models. Notably, with
ResNet as the surrogate on MTARSI, our method achieves a 17.28% average
improvement in black-box attack success rate.

*Saad Lahlali,Alexandre Fournier Montgieux,Nicolas Granger,Hervé Le Borgne,Quoc Cuong Pham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MVAT, a framework for weakly supervised 3D object detection that uses temporal multi-view data for improved 3D box estimation without requiring 3D box annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Annotating 3D data is expensive and challenging, necessitating advances in weakly supervised methods that depend on more accessible 2D box annotations. Overcoming projection ambiguities from 2D boxes and addressing incomplete object visibility with single-view data are critical.

Method: MVAT employs temporal multi-view aggregation to build dense 3D object representations, integrates a Teacher-Student paradigm with pseudo-labeling, and uses a multi-view 2D projection loss for consistency between 3D predictions and 2D annotations.

Result: MVAT achieves state-of-the-art performance in weakly supervised 3D object detection on nuScenes and Waymo Open datasets, substantially narrowing the gap with fully supervised approaches and requiring no 3D box annotations.

Conclusion: MVAT effectively addresses the challenges of weakly supervised 3D object detection by leveraging sequential data and a combination of innovative methods, demonstrating strong performance while eliminating the need for costly 3D annotations.

Abstract: Annotating 3D data remains a costly bottleneck for 3D object detection,
motivating the development of weakly supervised annotation methods that rely on
more accessible 2D box annotations. However, relying solely on 2D boxes
introduces projection ambiguities since a single 2D box can correspond to
multiple valid 3D poses. Furthermore, partial object visibility under a single
viewpoint setting makes accurate 3D box estimation difficult. We propose MVAT,
a novel framework that leverages temporal multi-view present in sequential data
to address these challenges. Our approach aggregates object-centric point
clouds across time to build 3D object representations as dense and complete as
possible. A Teacher-Student distillation paradigm is employed: The Teacher
network learns from single viewpoints but targets are derived from temporally
aggregated static objects. Then the Teacher generates high quality
pseudo-labels that the Student learns to predict from a single viewpoint for
both static and moving objects. The whole framework incorporates a multi-view
2D projection loss to enforce consistency between predicted 3D boxes and all
available 2D annotations. Experiments on the nuScenes and Waymo Open datasets
demonstrate that MVAT achieves state-of-the-art performance for weakly
supervised 3D object detection, significantly narrowing the gap with fully
supervised methods without requiring any 3D box annotations. % \footnote{Code

TL;DR: The paper introduces EHWGesture, a multimodal dataset for studying dynamic gestures relevant to clinical hand dexterity, addressing gaps in dataset diversity and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current gesture understanding challenges exist in the dynamic domain due to complex spatiotemporal variations and the lack of high-quality multimodal datasets with proper tracking and action quality components.

Method: The authors created EHWGesture, a dataset capturing five clinically relevant gestures from 25 subjects using synchronized RGB-Depth cameras, an event camera, and motion capture for ground-truth tracking, organizing recordings based on execution speed to align with clinical evaluations.

Result: They produced a 6-hour dataset (1,100+ recordings) enabling analysis of gesture classification, trigger detection, and execution quality assessment, offering a benchmark for advanced gesture research.

Conclusion: EHWGesture provides a robust multimodal dataset that bridges gaps in clinical and dynamic gesture understanding, paving the way for improved benchmarking and applications in clinical assessments.

Abstract: Hand gesture understanding is essential for several applications in
human-computer interaction, including automatic clinical assessment of hand
dexterity. While deep learning has advanced static gesture recognition, dynamic
gesture understanding remains challenging due to complex spatiotemporal
variations. Moreover, existing datasets often lack multimodal and multi-view
diversity, precise ground-truth tracking, and an action quality component
embedded within gestures. This paper introduces EHWGesture, a multimodal video
dataset for gesture understanding featuring five clinically relevant gestures.
It includes over 1,100 recordings (6 hours), captured from 25 healthy subjects
using two high-resolution RGB-Depth cameras and an event camera. A motion
capture system provides precise ground-truth hand landmark tracking, and all
devices are spatially calibrated and synchronized to ensure cross-modal
alignment. Moreover, to embed an action quality task within gesture
understanding, collected recordings are organized in classes of execution speed
that mirror clinical evaluations of hand dexterity. Baseline experiments
highlight the dataset's potential for gesture classification, gesture trigger
detection, and action quality assessment. Thus, EHWGesture can serve as a
comprehensive benchmark for advancing multimodal clinical gesture
understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Universal Few-Shot Control (UFC) enhances adaptability and lowers training costs for novel spatial control tasks in text-to-image diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing control adapters struggle with adaptability and require significant training for novel spatial control conditions.

Method: UFC uses analogy-based mechanisms to generate task-specific control features from a few examples, requiring minimal fine-tuning.

Result: UFC provides fine-grained spatial control with competitive performance using only a fraction (0.1%) of the training data and works across different diffusion architectures.

Conclusion: The UFC approach significantly improves efficiency and adaptability, setting a versatile framework for spatial conditioning in image generation.

Abstract: Spatial conditioning in pretrained text-to-image diffusion models has
significantly improved fine-grained control over the structure of generated
images. However, existing control adapters exhibit limited adaptability and
incur high training costs when encountering novel spatial control conditions
that differ substantially from the training tasks. To address this limitation,
we propose Universal Few-Shot Control (UFC), a versatile few-shot control
adapter capable of generalizing to novel spatial conditions. Given a few
image-condition pairs of an unseen task and a query condition, UFC leverages
the analogy between query and support conditions to construct task-specific
control features, instantiated by a matching mechanism and an update on a small
set of task-specific parameters. Experiments on six novel spatial control tasks
show that UFC, fine-tuned with only 30 annotated examples of novel tasks,
achieves fine-grained control consistent with the spatial conditions. Notably,
when fine-tuned with 0.1% of the full training data, UFC achieves competitive
performance with the fully supervised baselines in various control tasks. We
also show that UFC is applicable agnostically to various diffusion backbones
and demonstrate its effectiveness on both UNet and DiT architectures. Code is

TL;DR: This paper improves 3D medical image computing by introducing an HU-based Foreground Masking strategy for masked image modeling (MIM), enhancing segmentation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this study is to address the limitations of random masking in 3D medical image modeling, which fails to consider the density of anatomical objects and leads to suboptimal results.

Method: The authors propose an HU (Hounsfield Unit)-based Foreground Masking approach that focuses on the intensity distribution of diagnostically meaningful features, such as visceral organs, while excluding irrelevant regions like air and fluid.

Result: Experiments on five 3D medical imaging datasets showed significant improvement in segmentation performance, with Dice scores ranging from 78.55% to 92.43%.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the effectiveness of domain-specific masking strategies in MIM for medical imaging, opening new opportunities for improving medical image segmentation.

Abstract: While Masked Image Modeling (MIM) has revolutionized fields of computer
vision, its adoption in 3D medical image computing has been limited by the use
of random masking, which overlooks the density of anatomical objects. To
address this limitation, we enhance the pretext task with a simple yet
effective masking strategy. Leveraging Hounsfield Unit (HU) measurements, we
implement an HU-based Foreground Masking, which focuses on the intensity
distribution of visceral organs and excludes non-tissue regions, such as air
and fluid, that lack diagnostically meaningful features. Extensive experiments
on five public 3D medical imaging datasets demonstrate that our masking
consistently improves performance, both in quality of segmentation and Dice
score (BTCV:~84.64\%, Flare22:~92.43\%, MM-WHS:~90.67\%, Amos22:~88.64\%,
BraTS:~78.55\%). These results underscore the importance of domain-centric MIM
and suggest a promising direction for representation learning in medical image
segmentation. Implementation is available at github.com/AISeedHub/SubFore/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the gap in leveraging spoken queries for knowledge base question-answering directly over visual document images, expanding practical applications by avoiding conversion to text.

Method: TextlessRAG uses a fully textless pipeline that directly interprets speech, retrieves relevant document knowledge, and generates answers, incorporating a layout-aware reranking for enhanced performance.

Result: The framework showed significant improvements in both efficiency and accuracy, and a bilingual dataset (Chinese and English) was introduced to facilitate further research.

Conclusion: TextlessRAG represents a pioneering effort in textless speech-to-knowledge frameworks, offering promising advancements in multimodal and bilingual question-answering capabilities.

Abstract: Document images encapsulate a wealth of knowledge, while the portability of
spoken queries enables broader and flexible application scenarios. Yet, no
prior work has explored knowledge base question answering over visual document
images with queries provided directly in speech. We propose TextlessRAG, the
first end-to-end framework for speech-based question answering over large-scale
document images. Unlike prior methods, TextlessRAG eliminates ASR, TTS and OCR,
directly interpreting speech, retrieving relevant visual knowledge, and
generating answers in a fully textless pipeline. To further boost performance,
we integrate a layout-aware reranking mechanism to refine retrieval.
Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in both efficiency and
accuracy. To advance research in this direction, we also release the first
bilingual speech--document RAG dataset, featuring Chinese and English voice
queries paired with multimodal document content. Both the dataset and our
pipeline will be made available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a fast and efficient framework for reconstructing Gaussian full-head models from a single unposed image using a feed-forward method, eliminating the need for time-intensive methods like GAN inversion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous approaches for reconstructing full-head models relied on slow methods like GAN inversion and test-time optimization. There was a need for a faster and efficient framework to address this limitation.

Method: The proposed framework uses a synthetic dataset created by trained 3D GANs and leverages a dual-branch approach that combines spherical triplane features with point-based features. It employs a coarse-to-fine Gaussian head generation pipeline using transformers for feature extraction and shape reconstruction.

Result: The framework achieves efficient and high-fidelity Gaussian head reconstruction with a single forward pass, demonstrating its effectiveness when compared with existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a fast, accurate, and scalable solution for single-image Gaussian full-head synthesis, overcoming the limitations of prior methods and showcasing its experimental efficiency.

Abstract: We present a feed-forward framework for Gaussian full-head synthesis from a
single unposed image. Unlike previous work that relies on time-consuming GAN
inversion and test-time optimization, our framework can reconstruct the
Gaussian full-head model given a single unposed image in a single forward pass.
This enables fast reconstruction and rendering during inference. To mitigate
the lack of large-scale 3D head assets, we propose a large-scale synthetic
dataset from trained 3D GANs and train our framework using only synthetic data.
For efficient high-fidelity generation, we introduce a coarse-to-fine Gaussian
head generation pipeline, where sparse points from the FLAME model interact
with the image features by transformer blocks for feature extraction and coarse
shape reconstruction, which are then densified for high-fidelity
reconstruction. To fully leverage the prior knowledge residing in pretrained 3D
GANs for effective reconstruction, we propose a dual-branch framework that
effectively aggregates the structured spherical triplane feature and
unstructured point-based features for more effective Gaussian head
reconstruction. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our framework
towards existing work.

*Barkin Buyukcakir,Rocharles Cavalcante Fontenele,Reinhilde Jacobs,Jannick De Tobel,Patrick Thevissen,Dirk Vandermeulen,Peter Claes*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the CGAT architecture for 3D shape recognition tasks, using attention visualization and graph attention convolutions, particularly for Demirjian stage allocation on dental data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the black-box nature of deep learning models and improve trust and accountability in high-stakes applications, particularly for 3D shape recognition tasks.

Method: The CGAT architecture utilizes graph attention convolutions and an attention mechanism with directed edges to a global CLS node. It employs node features like local mean curvature and distance to centroid, evaluated in combination and individually.

Result: The model incorporating both local mean curvature and distance to centroid achieved a slight performance boost with a 0.76 weighted F1 score. It also produced intuitive attention maps, facilitating model explanation.

Conclusion: CGAT improves trust by generating human-understandable attention maps, proving its utility in dental data analysis and beyond, offering reliable and explainable models applicable to other graph-based tasks.

Abstract: Deep learning offers a promising avenue for automating many recognition tasks
in fields such as medicine and forensics. However, the black-box nature of
these models hinders their adoption in high-stakes applications where trust and
accountability are required. For 3D shape recognition tasks in particular, this
paper introduces the Class Node Graph Attention Network (CGAT) architecture to
address this need. Applied to 3D meshes of third molars derived from CBCT
images, for Demirjian stage allocation, CGAT utilizes graph attention
convolutions and an inherent attention mechanism, visualized via attention
rollout, to explain its decision-making process. We evaluated the local mean
curvature and distance to centroid node features, both individually and in
combination, as well as model depth, finding that models incorporating directed
edges to a global CLS node produced more intuitive attention maps, while also
yielding desirable classification performance. We analyzed the attention-based
explanations of the models, and their predictive performances to propose
optimal settings for the CGAT. The combination of local mean curvature and
distance to centroid as node features yielded a slight performance increase
with 0.76 weighted F1 score, and more comprehensive attention visualizations.
The CGAT architecture's ability to generate human-understandable attention maps
can enhance trust and facilitate expert validation of model decisions. While
demonstrated on dental data, CGAT is broadly applicable to graph-based
classification and regression tasks, promoting wider adoption of transparent
and competitive deep learning models in high-stakes environments.

*Robert Jöchl,Andreas Uhl*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper reviews temporal image forensics, focusing on time-dependent traces from image acquisition pipelines while raising concerns about content bias and proposing improvements in the field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Temporal image forensics relies on understanding the age of digital images using time-dependent traces. Reviewing the field is crucial to addressing issues like content bias and improving forensic techniques.

Method: The study includes a literature review, re-implementation of existing works, and experiments to verify in-field sensor defects' properties and evaluate tracing methods (e.g., neural networks).

Result: Key findings include validation of defect properties, identifying content bias in existing methods, investigation into neural network learning, and the ease with which neural networks can be distracted from actual age traces.

Conclusion: The paper advances the field by identifying issues, proposing a more realistic forensic setting, and emphasizing the need for explainable AI in verifying forensic reliability.

Abstract: Temporal image forensics is the science of estimating the age of a digital
image. Usually, time-dependent traces (age traces) introduced by the image
acquisition pipeline are exploited for this purpose. In this review, a
comprehensive overview of the field of temporal image forensics based on
time-dependent traces from the image acquisition pipeline is given. This
includes a detailed insight into the properties of known age traces (i.e.,
in-field sensor defects and sensor dust) and temporal image forensics
techniques. Another key aspect of this work is to highlight the problem of
content bias and to illustrate how important eXplainable Artificial
Intelligence methods are to verify the reliability of temporal image forensics
techniques. Apart from reviewing material presented in previous works, in this
review: (i) a new (probably more realistic) forensic setting is proposed; (ii)
the main properties (growth rate and spatial distribution) of in-field sensor
defects are verified; (iii) it is shown that a method proposed to utilize
in-field sensor defects for image age approximation actually exploits other
traces (most likely content bias); (iv) the features learned by a neural
network dating palmprint images are further investigated; (v) it is shown how
easily a neural network can be distracted from learning age traces. For this
purpose, previous work is analyzed, re-implemented if required and experiments
are conducted.

*Yusuke Hirota,Ryo Hachiuma,Boyi Li,Ximing Lu,Michael Ross Boone,Boris Ivanovic,Yejin Choi,Marco Pavone,Yu-Chiang Frank Wang,Noa Garcia,Yuta Nakashima,Chao-Han Huck Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper highlights a critical flaw in gender bias evaluations of vision-language models due to the influence of non-gender features, suggesting bias scores may be unreliable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the reliability of gender bias evaluation in vision-language models, given existing benchmarks often contain spurious correlations.

Method: The authors systematically introduced perturbations to non-gender features in four widely-used benchmarks and evaluated their impact on different vision-language models.

Result: Perturbations to non-gender features significantly affected bias metrics, altering scores by up to 175% in generative models and 43% in CLIP variants.

Conclusion: Current bias evaluations are unreliable due to the distortion caused by spurious features. The authors recommend reporting bias metrics alongside feature-sensitivity analysis for more accurate assessments.

Abstract: Gender bias in vision-language foundation models (VLMs) raises concerns about
their safe deployment and is typically evaluated using benchmarks with gender
annotations on real-world images. However, as these benchmarks often contain
spurious correlations between gender and non-gender features, such as objects
and backgrounds, we identify a critical oversight in gender bias evaluation: Do
spurious features distort gender bias evaluation? To address this question, we
systematically perturb non-gender features across four widely used benchmarks
(COCO-gender, FACET, MIAP, and PHASE) and various VLMs to quantify their impact
on bias evaluation. Our findings reveal that even minimal perturbations, such
as masking just 10% of objects or weakly blurring backgrounds, can dramatically
alter bias scores, shifting metrics by up to 175% in generative VLMs and 43% in
CLIP variants. This suggests that current bias evaluations often reflect model
responses to spurious features rather than gender bias, undermining their
reliability. Since creating spurious feature-free benchmarks is fundamentally
challenging, we recommend reporting bias metrics alongside feature-sensitivity
measurements to enable a more reliable bias assessment.

*Fangqi Cheng,Surajit Ray,Xiaochen Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a data-efficient fine-tuning approach for 3D CT-based medical vision-language models applied to Alzheimer's disease, outperforming conventional methods while using fewer training samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing medical vision-language models, such as underutilization of metadata, lack of diagnostic knowledge integration, and poor 3D imaging adaptation, while optimizing computational efficiency.

Method: The approach fine-tunes 3D CT-based models for 3D MRI with two main innovations: converting metadata into synthetic reports for richer image-text alignment and introducing an auxiliary token for predicting MMSE scores. Lightweight prompt tuning is applied to both image and text modalities.

Result: The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on Alzheimer's disease diagnosis using only 1,500 training images, surpassing models fine-tuned on 10,000 images.

Conclusion: The method is an effective and computationally efficient means to fine-tune medical vision-language models for 3D imaging tasks, demonstrating better performance on AD diagnosis with fewer resources.

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (Med-VLMs) have shown impressive results in
tasks such as report generation and visual question answering, but they still
face several limitations. Most notably, they underutilize patient metadata and
lack integration of clinical diagnostic knowledge. Moreover, most existing
models are typically trained from scratch or fine-tuned on large-scale 2D
image-text pairs, requiring extensive computational resources, and their
effectiveness on 3D medical imaging is often limited due to the absence of
structural information. To address these gaps, we propose a data-efficient
fine-tuning pipeline to adapt 3D CT-based Med-VLMs for 3D MRI and demonstrate
its application in Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. Our system introduces
two key innovations. First, we convert structured metadata into synthetic
reports, enriching textual input for improved image-text alignment. Second, we
add an auxiliary token trained to predict the mini-mental state examination
(MMSE) score, a widely used clinical measure of cognitive function that
correlates with AD severity. This provides additional supervision for
fine-tuning. Applying lightweight prompt tuning to both image and text
modalities, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on two AD
datasets using 1,500 training images, outperforming existing methods fine-tuned
on 10,000 images. Code will be released upon publication.

*Fangqi Cheng,Yingying Zhao,Xiaochen Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a self-supervised cross-encoder method to diagnose neurodegenerative diseases using MRI data without relying heavily on labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for diagnosing neurodegenerative diseases with MRI lack interpretability and require large volumes of labeled data.

Method: The proposed framework leverages temporal continuity in longitudinal MRI scans and disentangles representations into static features using contrastive learning and dynamic features through input-gradient regularization.

Result: Experimental results on multiple datasets (ADNI, OASIS, PPMI) show higher classification accuracy, improved interpretability, zero-shot generalization, and cross-task generalization.

Conclusion: The approach achieves superior performance compared to existing methods and enhances interpretability, showcasing its potential for practical application in neurodegenerative disease diagnosis.

Abstract: Deep learning has shown significant potential in diagnosing neurodegenerative
diseases from MRI data. However, most existing methods rely heavily on large
volumes of labeled data and often yield representations that lack
interpretability. To address both challenges, we propose a novel
self-supervised cross-encoder framework that leverages the temporal continuity
in longitudinal MRI scans for supervision. This framework disentangles learned
representations into two components: a static representation, constrained by
contrastive learning, which captures stable anatomical features; and a dynamic
representation, guided by input-gradient regularization, which reflects
temporal changes and can be effectively fine-tuned for downstream
classification tasks. Experimental results on the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that our method achieves
superior classification accuracy and improved interpretability. Furthermore,
the learned representations exhibit strong zero-shot generalization on the Open
Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) dataset and cross-task generalization
on the Parkinson Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) dataset. The code for the
proposed method will be made publicly available.

*Sung Ju Lee,Nam Ik Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Hermitian Symmetric Fourier Watermarking (SFW) and a center-aware embedding strategy to improve semantic watermarking's robustness and detection accuracy against attacks like regeneration and cropping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address challenges in semantic watermarking for latent diffusion models, specifically detection degradation due to loss of frequency integrity and vulnerability to cropping attacks.

Method: They propose Hermitian Symmetric Fourier Watermarking (SFW) to enforce frequency integrity and a center-aware embedding strategy to ensure retention of robust information during cropping.

Result: The methods achieve higher detection accuracy, surpassing previous approaches in robustness, identification performance, and maintaining superior image fidelity as validated by FID and CLIP scores.

Conclusion: This framework effectively balances robustness and image fidelity, significantly improving semantic watermarking techniques for latent diffusion models.

Abstract: Semantic watermarking techniques for latent diffusion models (LDMs) are
robust against regeneration attacks, but often suffer from detection
performance degradation due to the loss of frequency integrity. To tackle this
problem, we propose a novel embedding method called Hermitian Symmetric Fourier
Watermarking (SFW), which maintains frequency integrity by enforcing Hermitian
symmetry. Additionally, we introduce a center-aware embedding strategy that
reduces the vulnerability of semantic watermarking due to cropping attacks by
ensuring robust information retention. To validate our approach, we apply these
techniques to existing semantic watermarking schemes, enhancing their
frequency-domain structures for better robustness and retrieval accuracy.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our methods achieve state-of-the-art
verification and identification performance, surpassing previous approaches
across various attack scenarios. Ablation studies confirm the impact of SFW on
detection capabilities, the effectiveness of the center-aware embedding against
cropping, and how message capacity influences identification accuracy. Notably,
our method achieves the highest detection accuracy while maintaining superior
image fidelity, as evidenced by FID and CLIP scores. Conclusively, our proposed
SFW is shown to be an effective framework for balancing robustness and image
fidelity, addressing the inherent trade-offs in semantic watermarking. Code

*Guoyi Zhang,Siyang Chen,Guangsheng Xu,Zhihua Shen,Han Wang,Xiaohu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses small moving target detection challenges by proposing TenRPCANet, a deep learning framework utilizing low-rank and sparse decomposition of cluttered backgrounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for effective small moving target detection in complex environments and defense applications, where traditional methods fail due to low robustness.

Method: A tensor-based low-rank and sparse decomposition reformulation combined with the TenRPCANet model, leveraging tokenization and self-attention mechanisms.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multi-frame infrared target detection and space object detection tasks, showing its effectiveness and generalizability.

Conclusion: The approach couples target detection and background modeling, introducing a robust and generalized framework for challenging detection tasks.

Abstract: Small moving target detection is crucial for many defense applications but
remains highly challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratios, ambiguous visual
cues, and cluttered backgrounds. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning
framework that differs fundamentally from existing approaches, which often rely
on target-specific features or motion cues and tend to lack robustness in
complex environments. Our key insight is that small target detection and
background discrimination are inherently coupled, even cluttered video
backgrounds often exhibit strong low-rank structures that can serve as stable
priors for detection. We reformulate the task as a tensor-based low-rank and
sparse decomposition problem and conduct a theoretical analysis of the
background, target, and noise components to guide model design. Building on
these insights, we introduce TenRPCANet, a deep neural network that requires
minimal assumptions about target characteristics. Specifically, we propose a
tokenization strategy that implicitly enforces multi-order tensor low-rank
priors through a self-attention mechanism. This mechanism captures both local
and non-local self-similarity to model the low-rank background without relying
on explicit iterative optimization. In addition, inspired by the sparse
component update in tensor RPCA, we design a feature refinement module to
enhance target saliency. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on two highly distinct and challenging tasks: multi-frame infrared
small target detection and space object detection. These results demonstrate
both the effectiveness and the generalizability of our approach.

*Haokai Zhu,Bo Qu,Si-Yuan Cao,Runmin Zhang,Shujie Chen,Bailin Yang,Hui-Liang Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The proposed EDFFDNet introduces a free-form deformation approach along with innovative refinements to enhance image registration under depth disparities, achieving significant computational efficiency and accuracy gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods struggled to address real scenes with depth disparities, leading to a need for improved efficiency and accuracy.

Method: EDFFDNet employs exponential-decay free-form deformation, Adaptive Sparse Motion Aggregator (ASMA), and a progressive correlation refinement strategy.

Result: Experiments showed EDFFDNet reduced runtime by 33.7% and boosted PSNR by 0.5 dB, while EDFFDNet-2 further improved PSNR by 1.06 dB with lower computational costs.

Conclusion: EDFFDNet achieves superior performance and generalization for image registration across datasets, surpassing prior methods in both efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Previous deep image registration methods that employ single homography,
multi-grid homography, or thin-plate spline often struggle with real scenes
containing depth disparities due to their inherent limitations. To address
this, we propose an Exponential-Decay Free-Form Deformation Network (EDFFDNet),
which employs free-form deformation with an exponential-decay basis function.
This design achieves higher efficiency and performs well in scenes with depth
disparities, benefiting from its inherent locality. We also introduce an
Adaptive Sparse Motion Aggregator (ASMA), which replaces the MLP motion
aggregator used in previous methods. By transforming dense interactions into
sparse ones, ASMA reduces parameters and improves accuracy. Additionally, we
propose a progressive correlation refinement strategy that leverages
global-local correlation patterns for coarse-to-fine motion estimation, further
enhancing efficiency and accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that EDFFDNet
reduces parameters, memory, and total runtime by 70.5%, 32.6%, and 33.7%,
respectively, while achieving a 0.5 dB PSNR gain over the state-of-the-art
method. With an additional local refinement stage,EDFFDNet-2 further improves
PSNR by 1.06 dB while maintaining lower computational costs. Our method also
demonstrates strong generalization ability across datasets, outperforming
previous deep learning methods.

*Himanshu Singh,A. V. Subramanyam,Shivank Rajput,Mohan Kankanhalli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel adversarial training method to tackle inter-class feature overlap by projecting out inter-class dependencies for improved robustness and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks are highly effective for image classification but are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, partly due to inter-class feature overlap.

Method: The approach involves identifying nearest inter-class neighbors for adversarial samples and removing their projections in the feature space, aiming to enforce feature separability.

Result: Experimentation across benchmarks like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN showed competitive performance with leading adversarial techniques in both robust and clean accuracy.

Conclusion: Explicitly mitigating inter-class feature proximity enhances adversarial robustness and generalization in deep neural networks.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have exhibited impressive performance in image
classification tasks but remain vulnerable to adversarial examples. Standard
adversarial training enhances robustness but typically fails to explicitly
address inter-class feature overlap, a significant contributor to adversarial
susceptibility. In this work, we introduce a novel adversarial training
framework that actively mitigates inter-class proximity by projecting out
inter-class dependencies from adversarial and clean samples in the feature
space. Specifically, our approach first identifies the nearest inter-class
neighbors for each adversarial sample and subsequently removes projections onto
these neighbors to enforce stronger feature separability. Theoretically, we
demonstrate that our proposed logits correction reduces the Lipschitz constant
of neural networks, thereby lowering the Rademacher complexity, which directly
contributes to improved generalization and robustness. Extensive experiments
across standard benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN show that
our method demonstrates strong performance that is competitive with leading
adversarial training techniques, highlighting significant achievements in both
robust and clean accuracy. Our findings reveal the importance of addressing
inter-class feature proximity explicitly to bolster adversarial robustness in
DNNs.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a system using a large language model agent and video analysis modules to improve complex video reasoning tasks, outperforming existing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in video-based tasks that require complex reasoning on long videos and intricate queries, which existing perception models struggle with.

Method: The authors designed a large language model agent integrated with video analysis modules that dynamically adapt their reasoning steps based on observed intermediate results. Additionally, they introduced a critic system to identify and refine successful reasoning sequences.

Result: Their approach demonstrated strong performance gains on benchmarks like LVBench, Neptune, and ActivityNet-RTL compared to previous methodologies.

Conclusion: Dynamic reasoning processes combined with perception capabilities and a critic system can overcome challenges in complex video reasoning, enhancing video understanding tasks.

Abstract: Video understanding has seen significant progress in recent years, with
models' performance on perception from short clips continuing to rise. Yet,
multiple recent benchmarks, such as LVBench, Neptune, and ActivityNet-RTL, show
performance wanes for tasks requiring complex reasoning on videos as queries
grow more complex and videos grow longer. In this work, we ask: can existing
perception capabilities be leveraged to successfully perform more complex video
reasoning? In particular, we develop a large language model agent given access
to video modules as subagents or tools. Rather than following a fixed procedure
to solve queries as in previous work such as Visual Programming, ViperGPT, and
MoReVQA, the agent uses the results of each call to a module to determine
subsequent steps. Inspired by work in the textual reasoning domain, we
introduce a critic to distinguish between instances of successful and
unsuccessful sequences from the agent. We show that the combination of our
agent and critic achieve strong performance on the previously-mentioned
datasets.

*Chunhang Zheng,Zichang Ren,Dou Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SEEC improves lossless image compression by using semantic segmentation to apply multiple entropy models tailored to different semantic regions for better pixel value distribution estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image compression methods struggle to handle the varying statistical characteristics across different semantic regions of an image, limiting their ability to achieve optimal compression.

Method: SEEC employs semantic segmentation to identify regions in an image and assigns specialized entropy models to each. It uses multi-channel discrete logistic mixture likelihoods for better modeling of pixel value distributions.

Result: SEEC achieves state-of-the-art compression ratios while maintaining low encoding and decoding latency according to experimental results on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: SEEC provides improved compression performance and the ability to support Region of Interest coding based on semantic segmentation masks, enhancing its utility and adaptability.

Abstract: Recently, learned image compression has attracted considerable attention due
to its superior performance over traditional methods. However, most existing
approaches employ a single entropy model to estimate the probability
distribution of pixel values across the entire image, which limits their
ability to capture the diverse statistical characteristics of different
semantic regions. To overcome this limitation, we propose Segmentation-Assisted
Multi-Entropy Models for Lossless Image Compression (SEEC). Our framework
utilizes semantic segmentation to guide the selection and adaptation of
multiple entropy models, enabling more accurate probability distribution
estimation for distinct semantic regions. Specifically, SEEC first extracts
image features and then applies semantic segmentation to identify different
regions, each assigned a specialized entropy model to better capture its unique
statistical properties. Finally, a multi-channel discrete logistic mixture
likelihood is employed to model the pixel value distributions effectively.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SEEC achieves
state-of-the-art compression ratios while introducing only minimal encoding and
decoding latency. With superior performance, the proposed model also supports
Regions of Interest (ROIs) coding condition on the provided segmentation mask.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses stroke recurrence—significant due to high mortality rates—by predicting relapse and survival times using multimodal deep learning on brain images and patient data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With high mortality rates for recurrent strokes, predicting relapse early can guide therapy planning to save lives.

Method: Collected 3D intracranial CTA data and patient demographic/health details from 2010–2024. Trained single/multimodal neural networks for binary relapse detection (Task 1) and relapse-free survival (RFS) prediction (Task 2).

Result: In binary relapse detection, tabular data achieved high predictive performance (AUC: 0.84), while multimodal XSRD-net for RFS prediction yielded intermediate c-index (0.68) and AUC (0.71).

Conclusion: Heart diseases and carotid artery insights were linked to relapse prediction, with further work ongoing to improve data and model efficacy.

Abstract: Stroke is the second most frequent cause of death world wide with an annual
mortality of around 5.5 million. Recurrence rates of stroke are between 5 and
25% in the first year. As mortality rates for relapses are extraordinarily high
(40%) it is of utmost importance to reduce the recurrence rates. We address
this issue by detecting patients at risk of stroke recurrence at an early stage
in order to enable appropriate therapy planning. To this end we collected 3D
intracranial CTA image data and recorded concomitant heart diseases, the age
and the gender of stroke patients between 2010 and 2024. We trained single- and
multimodal deep learning based neural networks for binary relapse detection
(Task 1) and for relapse free survival (RFS) time prediction together with a
subsequent classification (Task 2). The separation of relapse from non-relapse
patients (Task 1) could be solved with tabular data (AUC on test dataset:
0.84). However, for the main task, the regression (Task 2), our multimodal
XSRD-net processed the modalities vision:tabular with 0.68:0.32 according to
modality contribution measures. The c-index with respect to relapses for the
multimodal model reached 0.68, and the AUC is 0.71 for the test dataset. Final,
deeper interpretability analysis results could highlight a link between both
heart diseases (tabular) and carotid arteries (vision) for the detection of
relapses and the prediction of the RFS time. This is a central outcome that we
strive to strengthen with ongoing data collection and model retraining.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern vision-language models struggle with visual reasoning over structured data like tables, and existing benchmarks lack the necessary diversity, scale, and depth for robust evaluation.

Method: The authors built a fully autonomous and scalable pipeline involving multiple reasoning LLMs collaborating for generation, validation, and inspiration. This pipeline produces LaTeX-rendered tables and QA pairs using multi-model prompting and jury filtering.

Result: Visual-TableQA consists of 2.5k complex tables and 6k reasoning-focused QA pairs. Models fine-tuned on this dataset show strong generalization and outperform proprietary models on external benchmarks.

Conclusion: The authors provide a cost-efficient, open-resource dataset and pipeline for developing and benchmarking visual reasoning capabilities, significantly advancing the field.

Abstract: Visual reasoning over structured data such as tables is a critical capability
for modern vision-language models (VLMs), yet current benchmarks remain limited
in scale, diversity, or reasoning depth, especially when it comes to rendered
table images. Addressing this gap, we introduce Visual-TableQA, a large-scale,
open-domain multimodal dataset specifically designed to evaluate and enhance
visual reasoning over complex tabular data. Our generation pipeline is modular,
scalable, and fully autonomous, involving multiple reasoning LLMs collaborating
across distinct roles: generation, validation, and inspiration. Visual-TableQA
comprises 2.5k richly structured LaTeX-rendered tables and 6k
reasoning-intensive QA pairs, all produced at a cost of under USD 100. To
promote diversity and creativity, our pipeline performs multi-model
collaborative data generation via cross-model prompting ('inspiration') and
LLM-jury filtering. Stronger models seed layouts and topics that weaker models
elaborate, collectively distilling diverse reasoning patterns and visual
structures into the dataset. Empirical results show that models fine-tuned on
Visual-TableQA generalize robustly to external benchmarks, outperforming
several proprietary models despite the dataset's synthetic nature. The full

TL;DR: This paper presents a method for reconstructing human hair geometry with strand-level accuracy using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), promising efficient results within one hour.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenging task of reconstructing human hair geometry for applications like virtual reality and digital human modeling, leveraging structure-aligned methods.

Method: The authors introduced a multi-stage pipeline using a differentiable Gaussian rasterizer to reconstruct detailed hair geometry, merging segments into coherent strands, and refining them under photometric supervision.

Result: The proposed method demonstrated robustness in handling varied hairstyles and efficiently reconstructed strand geometry across both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The novel approach improves both geometric and topological reconstruction of hair strands, and introduces a new metric for topological evaluation, making it a significant development in hair reconstruction.

Abstract: Human hair reconstruction is a challenging problem in computer vision, with
growing importance for applications in virtual reality and digital human
modeling. Recent advances in 3D Gaussians Splatting (3DGS) provide efficient
and explicit scene representations that naturally align with the structure of
hair strands. In this work, we extend the 3DGS framework to enable strand-level
hair geometry reconstruction from multi-view images. Our multi-stage pipeline
first reconstructs detailed hair geometry using a differentiable Gaussian
rasterizer, then merges individual Gaussian segments into coherent strands
through a novel merging scheme, and finally refines and grows the strands under
photometric supervision.
  While existing methods typically evaluate reconstruction quality at the
geometric level, they often neglect the connectivity and topology of hair
strands. To address this, we propose a new evaluation metric that serves as a
proxy for assessing topological accuracy in strand reconstruction. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our
method robustly handles a wide range of hairstyles and achieves efficient
reconstruction, typically completing within one hour.

### [131] [Mini-o3: Scaling Up Reasoning Patterns and Interaction Turns for Visual Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07969)
*Xin Lai,Junyi Li,Wei Li,Tao Liu,Tianjian Li,Hengshuang Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mini-o3 scales up tool-based interactions for visual search tasks and achieves state-of-the-art performance through multi-turn reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal models are limited in interaction turns and reasoning depth, hindering their performance in difficult visual search tasks.

Method: Mini-o3 employs a Visual Probe Dataset, iterative data collection for diverse reasoning patterns, and overturn masking for reinforcement learning scalability.

Result: The model can scale reasoning to tens of interaction turns during inference, with accuracy improving as interaction turns increase.

Conclusion: Mini-o3 demonstrates rich reasoning capabilities and resolves complex visual search problems effectively through deep multi-turn interactions.

Abstract: Recent advances in large multimodal models have leveraged image-based tools
with reinforcement learning to tackle visual problems. However, existing
open-source approaches often exhibit monotonous reasoning patterns and allow
only a limited number of interaction turns, making them inadequate for
difficult tasks that require trial-and-error exploration. In this work, we
address this limitation by scaling up tool-based interactions and introduce
Mini-o3, a system that executes deep, multi-turn reasoning -- spanning tens of
steps -- and achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging visual search
tasks. Our recipe for reproducing OpenAI o3-style behaviors comprises three key
components. First, we construct the Visual Probe Dataset, a collection of
thousands of challenging visual search problems designed for exploratory
reasoning. Second, we develop an iterative data collection pipeline to obtain
cold-start trajectories that exhibit diverse reasoning patterns, including
depth-first search, trial-and-error, and goal maintenance. Third, we propose an
over-turn masking strategy that prevents penalization of over-turn responses
(those that hit the maximum number of turns) during reinforcement learning,
thereby balancing training-time efficiency with test-time scalability. Despite
training with an upper bound of only six interaction turns, our model generates
trajectories that naturally scale to tens of turns at inference time, with
accuracy improving as the number of turns increases. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Mini-o3 produces rich reasoning patterns and deep thinking
paths, effectively solving challenging visual search problems.

*Hugo Blanc,Jean-Emmanuel Deschaud,Alexis Paljic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents RayGaussX, a novel method based on RayGauss that significantly accelerates rendering and training while improving visual quality for novel-view synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the computational inefficiency of RayGauss and enable high-quality, real-time rendering for real-world scenes.

Method: Enhancements include empty-space skipping, adaptive sampling, ray coherence improvements, scale regularization, and a densification criterion for better density distribution.

Result: RayGaussX achieves 5x to 12x faster training, 50x to 80x higher rendering speeds, and improves visual quality by up to +0.56 dB in PSNR on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: RayGaussX successfully addresses the limitations of RayGauss, making high-quality rendering feasible in real-time applications while optimizing both speed and quality.

Abstract: RayGauss has achieved state-of-the-art rendering quality for novel-view
synthesis on synthetic and indoor scenes by representing radiance and density
fields with irregularly distributed elliptical basis functions, rendered via
volume ray casting using a Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH). However, its
computational cost prevents real-time rendering on real-world scenes. Our
approach, RayGaussX, builds on RayGauss by introducing key contributions that
accelerate both training and inference. Specifically, we incorporate volumetric
rendering acceleration strategies such as empty-space skipping and adaptive
sampling, enhance ray coherence, and introduce scale regularization to reduce
false-positive intersections. Additionally, we propose a new densification
criterion that improves density distribution in distant regions, leading to
enhanced graphical quality on larger scenes. As a result, RayGaussX achieves 5x
to 12x faster training and 50x to 80x higher rendering speeds (FPS) on
real-world datasets while improving visual quality by up to +0.56 dB in PSNR.

### [133] [Faster, Self-Supervised Super-Resolution for Anisotropic Multi-View MRI Using a Sparse Coordinate Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07798)
*Maja Schlereth,Moritz Schillinger,Katharina Breininger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a self-supervised approach for combining two orthogonal low-resolution MR images to reconstruct details in a unified high-resolution representation, aiming to improve interpretation efficiency and patient comfort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address challenges in acquiring high-resolution MR images due to constraints such as acquisition time and patient comfort.

Method: The authors propose a multi-view neural network trained in a self-supervised manner, accompanied by a sparse coordinate-based loss function that integrates images with arbitrary scaling. They employ a combination of patient-agnostic offline and patient-specific online reconstruction phases.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates comparable or better super-resolution performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to ten times speed-up in patient-specific reconstruction while maintaining high-quality results.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that this method can enhance anatomical detail reconstruction in MR imaging without requiring corresponding high-resolution data, potentially streamlining clinical workflows in the medical sector.

Abstract: Acquiring images in high resolution is often a challenging task. Especially
in the medical sector, image quality has to be balanced with acquisition time
and patient comfort. To strike a compromise between scan time and quality for
Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging, two anisotropic scans with different
low-resolution (LR) orientations can be acquired. Typically, LR scans are
analyzed individually by radiologists, which is time consuming and can lead to
inaccurate interpretation. To tackle this, we propose a novel approach for
fusing two orthogonal anisotropic LR MR images to reconstruct anatomical
details in a unified representation. Our multi-view neural network is trained
in a self-supervised manner, without requiring corresponding high-resolution
(HR) data. To optimize the model, we introduce a sparse coordinate-based loss,
enabling the integration of LR images with arbitrary scaling. We evaluate our
method on MR images from two independent cohorts. Our results demonstrate
comparable or even improved super-resolution (SR) performance compared to
state-of-the-art (SOTA) self-supervised SR methods for different upsampling
scales. By combining a patient-agnostic offline and a patient-specific online
phase, we achieve a substantial speed-up of up to ten times for
patient-specific reconstruction while achieving similar or better SR quality.

*Mahtab Dahaghin,Milind G. Padalkar,Matteo Toso,Alessio Del Bue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SplatFill, an innovative depth-guided inpainting method for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), improving perceptual quality, geometry alignment, and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges in inpainting missing regions in 3DGS scenes, which often result in blurry details, artifacts, and geometry inconsistencies.

Method: The method combines depth-based and object-based supervision for accurate placement of inpainted Gaussians and introduces a consistency-aware refinement scheme to selectively correct inconsistent regions without disturbing the rest of the scene.

Result: SplatFill outperforms existing NeRF-based and 3DGS-based inpainting techniques, achieving superior visual fidelity and reducing training time by 24.5%. Qualitative evaluations highlight sharper details, fewer artifacts, and improved coherence.

Conclusion: The SplatFill approach provides a significant advancement in 3DGS inpainting, achieving state-of-the-art perceptual quality and better computational efficiency while resolving geometry inconsistencies in the scene.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled the creation of highly realistic 3D
scene representations from sets of multi-view images. However, inpainting
missing regions, whether due to occlusion or scene editing, remains a
challenging task, often leading to blurry details, artifacts, and inconsistent
geometry. In this work, we introduce SplatFill, a novel depth-guided approach
for 3DGS scene inpainting that achieves state-of-the-art perceptual quality and
improved efficiency. Our method combines two key ideas: (1) joint depth-based
and object-based supervision to ensure inpainted Gaussians are accurately
placed in 3D space and aligned with surrounding geometry, and (2) we propose a
consistency-aware refinement scheme that selectively identifies and corrects
inconsistent regions without disrupting the rest of the scene. Evaluations on
the SPIn-NeRF dataset demonstrate that SplatFill not only surpasses existing
NeRF-based and 3DGS-based inpainting methods in visual fidelity but also
reduces training time by 24.5%. Qualitative results show our method delivers
sharper details, fewer artifacts, and greater coherence across challenging
viewpoints.

### [135] [Point Linguist Model: Segment Any Object via Bridged Large 3D-Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07825)
*Zhuoxu Huang,Mingqi Gao,Jungong Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Point Linguist Model (PLM) to improve 3D segmentation by bridging linguistic and geometric representations, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address representation misalignment in 3D Segmentation with Large Language Models (LLMs), where semantic-rich LLM tokens do not align well with dense geometric data of 3D point clouds.

Method: The authors propose a framework called Point Linguist Model (PLM), which integrates Object-centric Discriminative Representation (OcDR) for semantic-object tokens and a Geometric Reactivation Decoder (GRD) to combine semantic-aware tokens with dense features.

Result: PLM achieves substantial performance improvement, including +7.3 mIoU on ScanNetv2, +6.0 mIoU on Multi3DRefer, along with consistent gains across 7 benchmarks and 4 tasks.

Conclusion: PLM effectively bridges the semantic-geometric representation gap, enabling robust 3D segmentation with enhanced object-centric reasoning and fine-grained accuracy.

Abstract: 3D object segmentation with Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a
prevailing paradigm due to its broad semantics, task flexibility, and strong
generalization. However, this paradigm is hindered by representation
misalignment: LLMs process high-level semantic tokens, whereas 3D point clouds
convey only dense geometric structures. In prior methods, misalignment limits
both input and output. At the input stage, dense point patches require heavy
pre-alignment, weakening object-level semantics and confusing similar
distractors. At the output stage, predictions depend only on dense features
without explicit geometric cues, leading to a loss of fine-grained accuracy. To
address these limitations, we present the Point Linguist Model (PLM), a general
framework that bridges the representation gap between LLMs and dense 3D point
clouds without requiring large-scale pre-alignment between 3D-text or
3D-images. Specifically, we introduce Object-centric Discriminative
Representation (OcDR), which learns object-centric tokens that capture target
semantics and scene relations under a hard negative-aware training objective.
This mitigates the misalignment between LLM tokens and 3D points, enhances
resilience to distractors, and facilitates semantic-level reasoning within
LLMs. For accurate segmentation, we introduce the Geometric Reactivation
Decoder (GRD), which predicts masks by combining OcDR tokens carrying
LLM-inferred geometry with corresponding dense features, preserving
comprehensive dense features throughout the pipeline. Extensive experiments
show that PLM achieves significant improvements of +7.3 mIoU on ScanNetv2 and
+6.0 mIoU on Multi3DRefer for 3D referring segmentation, with consistent gains
across 7 benchmarks spanning 4 different tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness
of comprehensive object-centric reasoning for robust 3D understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance environmental monitoring and disaster response by providing an accurate and automated method to map burned areas.

Method: The approach combines the high-resolution AlphaEarth dataset with the Siamese U-Net deep learning architecture, training on the MTBS dataset and testing across European regions.

Result: The model achieves a 95% accuracy, 0.6 IoU, and 74% F1-score, effectively identifying burned areas in diverse ecosystems with complex backgrounds.

Conclusion: The research advances automated fire damage assessment with a scalable and generalizable burned area mapping solution using the AlphaEarth dataset.

Abstract: Accurate and timely mapping of burned areas is crucial for environmental
monitoring, disaster management, and assessment of climate change. This study
presents a novel approach to automated burned area mapping using the AlphaEArth
dataset combined with the Siamese U-Net deep learning architecture. The
AlphaEArth Dataset, comprising high-resolution optical and thermal infrared
imagery with comprehensive ground-truth annotations, provides an unprecedented
resource for training robust burned area detection models. We trained our model
with the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) dataset in the contiguous US
and evaluated it with 17 regions cross in Europe. Our experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed ensemble approach achieves superior performance
with an overall accuracy of 95%, IoU of 0.6, and F1-score of 74% on the test
dataset. The model successfully identifies burned areas across diverse
ecosystems with complex background, showing particular strength in detecting
partially burned vegetation and fire boundaries and its transferability and
high generalization in burned area mapping. This research contributes to the
advancement of automated fire damage assessment and provides a scalable
solution for global burn area monitoring using the AlphaEarth dataset.

### [137] [D-LEAF: Localizing and Correcting Hallucinations in Multimodal LLMs via Layer-to-head Attention Diagnostics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07864)
*Tiancheng Yang,Lin Zhang,Jiaye Lin,Guimin Hu,Di Wang,Lijie Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper tackles the hallucination problem in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by introducing novel layer-specific diagnostic tools and proposing D-LEAF, a dynamic correction method that improves performance across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to mitigate hallucinations in MLLMs, which occur when generated text contradicts visual inputs due to insufficient visual attention, and existing solutions fail to localize and address specific erroneous layers.

Method: The authors introduce Layer Image Attention Entropy (LIAE) to identify problematic layers and Image Attention Focus (IAF) to rank attention heads. They propose D-LEAF, a task-agnostic method dynamically correcting errors based on these signals during inference.

Result: The D-LEAF method achieves a 53% relative improvement in image captioning benchmarks and a 4% boost in accuracy and F1-scores for visual question answering (VQA), reducing hallucinations with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that using layer-specific attention diagnostics and dynamic correction effectively mitigates hallucinations, improving MLLM performance on multiple tasks while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on tasks
like image captioning and visual question answering, but remain prone to
hallucinations, where generated text conflicts with the visual input. Prior
work links this partly to insufficient visual attention, but existing
attention-based detectors and mitigation typically apply uniform adjustments
across layers and heads, obscuring where errors originate. In this paper, we
first show these methods fail to accurately localize problematic layers. Then,
we introduce two diagnostics: Layer Image Attention Entropy (LIAE) which flags
anomalous layers, and Image Attention Focus (IAF) which scores attention heads
within those layers. Analysis shows that LIAE pinpoints faulty layers and IAF
reliably ranks heads that warrant correction. Guided by these signals, we
propose Dynamic Layer-wise Entropy and Attention Fusion (D-LEAF), a
task-agnostic, attention-guided method that dynamically localizes and corrects
errors during inference with negligible overhead. Results show our D-LEAF
delivers a 53% relative improvement on standard captioning benchmarks, and on
VQA both accuracy and F1-score improve by approximately 4%, substantially
suppressing hallucinations while preserving efficiency.

Motivation: To improve transparency, security, privacy, and copyright protection in AI models by developing tools to identify training data origins.

Method: Introduces a multitask learning process, training an Audited Model alongside a MINT Model, using intermediate activation maps for enhanced detection capabilities.

Result: Achieves over 80% accuracy in detecting training data usage across various architectures, outperforming existing methods on 5 benchmarks.

Conclusion: aMINT contributes to AI model transparency and security by offering robust detection of training data usage with broad applicability.

Abstract: Active Membership Inference Test (aMINT) is a method designed to detect
whether given data were used during the training of machine learning models. In
Active MINT, we propose a novel multitask learning process that involves
training simultaneously two models: the original or Audited Model, and a
secondary model, referred to as the MINT Model, responsible for identifying the
data used for training the Audited Model. This novel multi-task learning
approach has been designed to incorporate the auditability of the model as an
optimization objective during the training process of neural networks. The
proposed approach incorporates intermediate activation maps as inputs to the
MINT layers, which are trained to enhance the detection of training data. We
present results using a wide range of neural networks, from lighter
architectures such as MobileNet to more complex ones such as Vision
Transformers, evaluated in 5 public benchmarks. Our proposed Active MINT
achieves over 80% accuracy in detecting if given data was used for training,
significantly outperforming previous approaches in the literature. Our aMINT
and related methodological developments contribute to increasing transparency
in AI models, facilitating stronger safeguards in AI deployments to achieve
proper security, privacy, and copyright protection.

### [139] [Object-level Correlation for Few-Shot Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07917)
*Chunlin Wen,Yu Zhang,Jie Fan,Hongyuan Zhu,Xiu-Shen Wei,Yijun Wang,Zhiqiang Kou,Shuzhou Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces OCNet, a method for improving few-shot semantic segmentation by focusing on object-level correlations rather than image-level correlations, addressing background noise issues. It achieves state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the problem of hard pixel noise (irrelevant backgrounds) which leads to overfitting in few-shot semantic segmentation.

Method: The Object-level Correlation Network (OCNet) establishes object-level relationships using two modules: General Object Mining Module (GOMM) for saliency and similarity cues, and Correlation Construction Module (CCM) to match target prototypes with general object features.

Result: OCNet outperforms previous methods in segmenting novel objects with sparse data on benchmarks like PASCAL-$5^i$ and COCO-$20^i$.

Conclusion: Object-level correlation enhances few-shot semantic segmentation by improving the recognition of novel objects and suppressing background noise.

Abstract: Few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) aims to segment objects of novel
categories in the query images given only a few annotated support samples.
Existing methods primarily build the image-level correlation between the
support target object and the entire query image. However, this correlation
contains the hard pixel noise, \textit{i.e.}, irrelevant background objects,
that is intractable to trace and suppress, leading to the overfitting of the
background. To address the limitation of this correlation, we imitate the
biological vision process to identify novel objects in the object-level
information. Target identification in the general objects is more valid than in
the entire image, especially in the low-data regime. Inspired by this, we
design an Object-level Correlation Network (OCNet) by establishing the
object-level correlation between the support target object and query general
objects, which is mainly composed of the General Object Mining Module (GOMM)
and Correlation Construction Module (CCM). Specifically, GOMM constructs the
query general object feature by learning saliency and high-level similarity
cues, where the general objects include the irrelevant background objects and
the target foreground object. Then, CCM establishes the object-level
correlation by allocating the target prototypes to match the general object
feature. The generated object-level correlation can mine the query target
feature and suppress the hard pixel noise for the final prediction. Extensive
experiments on PASCAL-${5}^{i}$ and COCO-${20}^{i}$ show that our model
achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ScoreHOI, a method utilizing diffusion priors and iterative refinement to improve human-object interaction reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of physically implausible reconstruction results in joint human-object interaction analysis.

Method: ScoreHOI employs a diffusion-based optimization process with score-guided sampling and proposes a contact-driven iterative refinement to enforce physical constraints and enhance accuracy.

Result: ScoreHOI demonstrates superior reconstruction performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: ScoreHOI effectively improves the plausibility and accuracy of human-object interaction reconstructions using an innovative combination of diffusion priors and iterative refinement.

Abstract: Joint reconstruction of human-object interaction marks a significant
milestone in comprehending the intricate interrelations between humans and
their surrounding environment. Nevertheless, previous optimization methods
often struggle to achieve physically plausible reconstruction results due to
the lack of prior knowledge about human-object interactions. In this paper, we
introduce ScoreHOI, an effective diffusion-based optimizer that introduces
diffusion priors for the precise recovery of human-object interactions. By
harnessing the controllability within score-guided sampling, the diffusion
model can reconstruct a conditional distribution of human and object pose given
the image observation and object feature. During inference, the ScoreHOI
effectively improves the reconstruction results by guiding the denoising
process with specific physical constraints. Furthermore, we propose a
contact-driven iterative refinement approach to enhance the contact
plausibility and improve the reconstruction accuracy. Extensive evaluations on
standard benchmarks demonstrate ScoreHOI's superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its ability to achieve a precise and
robust improvement in joint human-object interaction reconstruction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ToothMCL, a framework for multimodal contrastive learning in digital dentistry, achieving state-of-the-art performance in tooth segmentation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of segmentation methodologies in digital dentistry, which often lack rigorous validation and struggle with performance and clinical applicability.

Method: The authors propose ToothMCL, a multimodal pretraining framework utilizing volumetric (CBCT) and surface-based (IOS) modalities, employing contrastive learning to capture fine-grained anatomical features.

Result: ToothMCL demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, achieving a 12% improvement in CBCT segmentation and 8% improvement in IOS segmentation, evaluated on the largest and most diverse datasets to date.

Conclusion: ToothMCL is a robust and generalizable approach for accurate tooth segmentation, paving the way for advanced applications in digital dentistry.

Abstract: Digital dentistry represents a transformative shift in modern dental
practice. The foundational step in this transformation is the accurate digital
representation of the patient's dentition, which is obtained from segmented
Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) and Intraoral Scans (IOS). Despite the
growing interest in digital dental technologies, existing segmentation
methodologies frequently lack rigorous validation and demonstrate limited
performance and clinical applicability. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work to introduce a multimodal pretraining framework for tooth
segmentation. We present ToothMCL, a Tooth Multimodal Contrastive Learning for
pretraining that integrates volumetric (CBCT) and surface-based (IOS)
modalities. By capturing modality-invariant representations through multimodal
contrastive learning, our approach effectively models fine-grained anatomical
features, enabling precise multi-class segmentation and accurate identification
of F\'ed\'eration Dentaire Internationale (FDI) tooth numbering. Along with the
framework, we curated CBCT-IOS3.8K, the largest paired CBCT and IOS dataset to
date, comprising 3,867 patients. We then evaluated ToothMCL on a comprehensive
collection of independent datasets, representing the largest and most diverse
evaluation to date. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
internal and external testing, with an increase of 12\% for CBCT segmentation
and 8\% for IOS segmentation in the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC).
Furthermore, ToothMCL consistently surpasses existing approaches in tooth
groups and demonstrates robust generalizability across varying imaging
conditions and clinical scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies system-level bottlenecks in deploying object detectors on resource-constrained systems like laptops and proposes a Two-Pass Adaptive Inference algorithm for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object detection performance on consumer-grade hardware lags behind benchmarks achieved on high-power GPUs.

Method: The authors introduce a hardware-agnostic Two-Pass Adaptive Inference algorithm using a low-resolution first pass and a high-resolution second pass, activated based on confidence levels.

Result: The method achieves a 1.85x speedup with a 5.51% mAP loss on a 5000-image COCO dataset compared to a PyTorch Early-Exit baseline.

Conclusion: This approach offers a practical solution for deploying real-time AI on consumer-grade devices by addressing hardware bottlenecks and focusing on system-level optimization rather than solely model improvements.

Abstract: As local AI grows in popularity, there is a critical gap between the
benchmark performance of object detectors and their practical viability on
consumer-grade hardware. While models like YOLOv10s promise real-time speeds,
these metrics are typically achieved on high-power, desktop-class GPUs. This
paper reveals that on resource-constrained systems, such as laptops with RTX
4060 GPUs, performance is not compute-bound but is instead dominated by
system-level bottlenecks, as illustrated by a simple bottleneck test. To
overcome this hardware-level constraint, we introduce a Two-Pass Adaptive
Inference algorithm, a model-independent approach that requires no
architectural changes. This study mainly focuses on adaptive inference
strategies and undertakes a comparative analysis of architectural early-exit
and resolution-adaptive routing, highlighting their respective trade-offs
within a unified evaluation framework. The system uses a fast, low-resolution
pass and only escalates to a high-resolution model pass when detection
confidence is low. On a 5000-image COCO dataset, our method achieves a 1.85x
speedup over a PyTorch Early-Exit baseline, with a modest mAP loss of 5.51%.
This work provides a practical and reproducible blueprint for deploying
high-performance, real-time AI on consumer-grade devices by shifting the focus
from pure model optimization to hardware-aware inference strategies that
maximize throughput.

Conclusion: The findings establish a promising basis for dynamic scene evaluations, advancing the capability of reconstructing uncooperative RSOs for space missions.

Abstract: Characterization of uncooperative Resident Space Objects (RSO) play a crucial

assess the geometry and motion properties. To address the challenges of
reconstructing tumbling uncooperative targets, this study evaluates the
performance of existing state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction algorithms for

environment using Isaac Sim to generate physics-accurate 2D image sequences of
tumbling satellite under realistic orbital lighting conditions. Our preliminary
results on static scenes using Neuralangelo demonstrate promising
reconstruction quality. The generated 3D meshes closely match the original CAD
models with minimal errors and artifacts when compared using Cloud Compare
(CC). The reconstructed models were able to capture critical fine details for
mission planning. This provides a baseline for our ongoing evaluation of
dynamic scene reconstruction.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the lack of interpretability in DNNs by introducing a decoder that generates images closely matching user-specified features, revealing which attributes are encoded by DNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the black-box nature of feature extraction in DNNs, particularly for vision-related tasks, by developing a method to better understand what features are encoded by DNNs.

Method: The proposed method is a guided diffusion model that directs a pre-trained diffusion model to match a user-specified feature by minimizing the Euclidean distance between features during the image generation process.

Result: The decoder successfully generates images with features closely matching user-specified ones and provides insights into the feature spaces of CLIP's image encoder, ResNet-50, and vision transformers.

Conclusion: The decoder offers a practical, GPU-efficient approach to analyze feature spaces across different DNNs without requiring additional training, enhancing interpretability of these models.

Abstract: One of the key issues in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is the black-box nature
of their internal feature extraction process. Targeting vision-related domains,
this paper focuses on analysing the feature space of a DNN by proposing a
decoder that can generate images whose features are guaranteed to closely match
a user-specified feature. Owing to this guarantee that is missed in past
studies, our decoder allows us to evidence which of various attributes in an
image are encoded into a feature by the DNN, by generating images whose
features are in proximity to that feature. Our decoder is implemented as a
guided diffusion model that guides the reverse image generation of a
pre-trained diffusion model to minimise the Euclidean distance between the
feature of a clean image estimated at each step and the user-specified feature.
One practical advantage of our decoder is that it can analyse feature spaces of
different DNNs with no additional training and run on a single COTS GPU. The
experimental results targeting CLIP's image encoder, ResNet-50 and vision
transformer demonstrate that images generated by our decoder have features
remarkably similar to the user-specified ones and reveal valuable insights into
these DNNs' feature spaces.

*Zheng Geng,Nan Wang,Shaocong Xu,Chongjie Ye,Bohan Li,Zhaoxi Chen,Sida Peng,Hao Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces OnePoseViaGen, a system for estimating the 6D pose of unseen objects from a single image, using coarse-to-fine alignment and synthetic data diversification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Estimating 6D poses for unseen objects from a single reference image is crucial in robotics, particularly for handling real-world instances where 3D models are absent and generating models is difficult.

Method: OnePoseViaGen combines two key strategies: a coarse-to-fine alignment module for iterative pose refinement, and a text-guided generative domain randomization approach that enriches synthetic training data by diversifying object textures.

Result: OnePoseViaGen achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks such as YCBInEOAT, Toyota-Light, and LM-O, outperforming previous methods.

Conclusion: The approach enables robust and precise one-shot 6D pose estimation and is validated in robotic manipulation tasks, highlighting its practical effectiveness in real-world applications.

Abstract: Estimating the 6D pose of arbitrary unseen objects from a single reference
image is critical for robotics operating in the long-tail of real-world
instances. However, this setting is notoriously challenging: 3D models are
rarely available, single-view reconstructions lack metric scale, and domain
gaps between generated models and real-world images undermine robustness. We
propose OnePoseViaGen, a pipeline that tackles these challenges through two key
components. First, a coarse-to-fine alignment module jointly refines scale and
pose by combining multi-view feature matching with render-and-compare
refinement. Second, a text-guided generative domain randomization strategy
diversifies textures, enabling effective fine-tuning of pose estimators with
synthetic data. Together, these steps allow high-fidelity single-view 3D
generation to support reliable one-shot 6D pose estimation. On challenging
benchmarks (YCBInEOAT, Toyota-Light, LM-O), OnePoseViaGen achieves
state-of-the-art performance far surpassing prior approaches. We further
demonstrate robust dexterous grasping with a real robot hand, validating the
practicality of our method in real-world manipulation. Project page:

### [146] [Visual Representation Alignment for Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07979)
*Heeji Yoon,Jaewoo Jung,Junwan Kim,Hyungyu Choi,Heeseong Shin,Sangbeom Lim,Honggyu An,Chaehyun Kim,Jisang Han,Donghyun Kim,Chanho Eom,Sunghwan Hong,Seungryong Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VIRAL, a technique to improve multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in vision-centric tasks by aligning their visual representations with pre-trained vision foundation models (VFMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs excel in diverse tasks but struggle with vision-specific tasks due to reliance on text-only supervision, which often neglects detailed visual information during training.

Method: VIRAL employs a regularization strategy to align the visual representations of MLLMs with those of VFMs, ensuring retention of visual details and complementing knowledge from VFMs.

Result: VIRAL significantly enhances performance on multimodal benchmarks, demonstrating improved reasoning in complex visual tasks, supported by ablation studies validating design choices.

Conclusion: The findings suggest VIRAL is a promising approach for integrating visual details in MLLMs, potentially unlocking better handling of vision-centric tasks and advancing multimodal AI.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) trained with visual instruction
tuning have achieved strong performance across diverse tasks, yet they remain
limited in vision-centric tasks such as object counting or spatial reasoning.
We attribute this gap to the prevailing text-only supervision paradigm, which
provides only indirect guidance for the visual pathway and often leads MLLMs to
discard fine-grained visual details during training. In this paper, we present
VIsual Representation ALignment (VIRAL), a simple yet effective regularization
strategy that aligns the internal visual representations of MLLMs with those of
pre-trained vision foundation models (VFMs). By explicitly enforcing this
alignment, VIRAL enables the model not only to retain critical visual details
from the input vision encoder but also to complement additional visual
knowledge from VFMs, thereby enhancing its ability to reason over complex
visual inputs. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across all
tasks on widely adopted multimodal benchmarks. Furthermore, we conduct
comprehensive ablation studies to validate the key design choices underlying
our framework. We believe this simple finding opens up an important direction
for the effective integration of visual information in training MLLMs.

*Guanzhou Hu,Yiwei Chen,Andrea Arpaci-Dusseau,Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Crossword is a consensus protocol designed for dynamic, data-heavy cloud workloads, improving efficiency and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in cloud contexts where data replication spans diverse payload sizes and induces sporadic bandwidth stress.

Method: Crossword uses adaptive shard assignment with erasure coding and prioritizes intelligent data distribution while ensuring availability guarantees.

Result: Crossword matches top existing protocols in static scenarios and improves performance by up to 2.3x in dynamic conditions, with successful integration into CockroachDB achieving 1.32x higher throughput.

Conclusion: Crossword demonstrates superior performance in dynamic environments and is poised for open-source release via Gazette implementation.

Abstract: We present Crossword, a flexible consensus protocol for dynamic data-heavy
workloads, a rising challenge in the cloud where replication payload sizes span
a wide spectrum and introduce sporadic bandwidth stress. Crossword applies
per-instance erasure coding and distributes coded shards intelligently to
reduce critical-path data transfer significantly when desirable. Unlike
previous approaches that statically assign shards to servers, Crossword enables
an adaptive tradeoff between the assignment of shards and quorum size in
reaction to dynamic workloads and network conditions, while always retaining
the availability guarantee of classic protocols. Crossword handles leader
failover gracefully by employing a lazy follower gossiping mechanism that
incurs minimal impact on critical-path performance. We implement Crossword
(along with relevant protocols) in Gazette, a distributed, replicated, and
protocol-generic key-value store written in async Rust. We evaluate Crossword
comprehensively to show that it matches the best performance among previous
protocols (MultiPaxos, Raft, RSPaxos, and CRaft) in static scenarios, and
outperforms them by up to 2.3x under dynamic workloads and network conditions.
Our integration of Crossword with CockroachDB brings 1.32x higher aggregate
throughput to TPC-C under 5-way replication. We will open-source Gazette upon
publication.

### [148] [Bodega: Serving Linearizable Reads Locally from Anywhere at Anytime via Roster Leases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07158)
*Guanzhou Hu,Andrea Arpaci-Dusseau,Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Bodega introduces a novel consensus protocol enabling linearizable local reads from any node without being disrupted by writes, showing significant performance improvements in client read requests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional consensus protocols face challenges in efficiently handling local reads and read-write interference, prompting the need for a novel approach.

Method: Bodega uses the roster leases algorithm, generalizing leadership to safeguard cluster metadata, along with mechanisms like all-to-all leasing, optimistic holding, smart roster coverage, and lightweight heartbeats.

Result: Bodega achieves 5.6x-13.1x faster average client read speeds under write interference, maintains competitive write performance, supports proactive roster changes, and performs on par with systems like etcd and ZooKeeper.

Conclusion: Bodega presents a non-intrusive consensus enhancement that significantly accelerates read performance while maintaining robustness and compatibility with existing systems.

Abstract: We present Bodega, the first consensus protocol that serves linearizable
reads locally from any desired node, regardless of interfering writes. Bodega
achieves this via a novel roster leases algorithm that safeguards the roster, a
new notion of cluster metadata. The roster is a generalization of leadership;
it tracks arbitrary subsets of replicas as responder nodes for local reads. A
consistent agreement on the roster is established through roster leases, an
all-to-all leasing mechanism that generalizes existing all-to-one leasing
approaches (Leader Leases, Quorum Leases), unlocking a new point in the
protocol design space. Bodega further employs optimistic holding and early
accept notifications to minimize interruption from interfering writes, and
incorporates smart roster coverage and lightweight heartbeats to maximize
practicality. Bodega is a non-intrusive extension to classic consensus; it
imposes no special requirements on writes other than a responder-covering
quorum. We implement Bodega and related works in Vineyard, a protocol-generic
replicated key-value store written in async Rust. We compare it to previous
protocols (Leader Leases, EPaxos, PQR, and Quorum Leases) and two production
coordination services (etcd and ZooKeeper). Bodega speeds up average client
read requests by 5.6x-13.1x on real WAN clusters versus previous approaches
under moderate write interference, delivers comparable write performance,
supports fast proactive roster changes as well as fault tolerance via leases,
and closely matches the performance of sequentially-consistent etcd and
ZooKeeper deployments across all YCSB workloads. We will open-source Vineyard
upon publication.

*Hai Dinh-Tuan,Tien Hung Nguyen,Sanjeet Raj Pandey*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: DREAMS is a decentralized framework for optimizing service placement in distributed systems, addressing scalability, latency, and fault tolerance issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address resource allocation challenges in distributed computing environments, especially in manufacturing, where dynamic workloads and decentralized operations demand adaptive and scalable solutions.

Method: DREAMS employs autonomous agents within domains, using Raft-based consensus and cost-benefit voting to make collaborative decisions on microservice placement.

Result: The framework optimizes service placement in distributed systems, achieving scalability and fault tolerance, with key operations scaling sub-linearly with system size.

Conclusion: DREAMS provides an efficient and fault-tolerant solution for global service placement in distributed systems, suitable for dynamic and multi-stakeholder scenarios like modern manufacturing.

Abstract: Modern manufacturing systems require adaptive computing infrastructures that
can respond to highly dynamic workloads and increasingly customized production
demands. The compute continuum emerges as a promising solution, enabling
flexible deployment of microservices across distributed, heterogeneous domains.
However, this paradigm also requires a novel approach to resource allocation
and service placement, as traditional centralized solutions struggle to scale
effectively, suffer from latency bottlenecks, and introduce single points of
failure. In this paper, we present DREAMS, a decentralized framework that
optimizes microservice placement decisions collaboratively across different
computational domains. At its core, DREAMS introduces agents that operate
autonomously within each domain while coordinating globally through a
Raft-based consensus algorithm and cost-benefit voting. This decentralized
architecture enables responsive, privacy-preserving, and fault-tolerant
coordination, making it particularly suitable given the growing prevalence of
multi-stakeholder scenarios across the compute continuum. In particular, within
modern manufacturing environments, DREAMS achieves globally optimized service
placements while maintaining high fault tolerance. Further evaluations
demonstrate that key coordination operations, such as Local Domain Manager
(LDM) registration and migration voting, scale sub-linearly with the number of
domains, confirming the efficiency and scalability of our proposal.

*Mohammad Sadegh Sirjani,Somayeh Sobati-Moghadam*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel algorithm integrating Improved Golden Eagle Optimization and reinforcement learning to achieve energy-efficient and QoS-aware task scheduling for IoT applications in Fog environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of resource allocation and job scheduling in Fog computing for IoT applications, aiming to reduce energy consumption and improve response times.

Method: The paper introduces the Reinforcement Improved Golden Eagle Optimization (RIGEO) algorithm which categorizes Fog nodes into low and high traffic levels. It applies Improved Golden Eagle Optimization with genetic operators for scheduling low-deadline tasks on low-traffic nodes and reinforcement learning for scheduling high-deadline tasks on high-traffic nodes.

Result: The proposed RIGEO algorithm achieves better performance in system response time, total deadline violation, as well as resource and energy efficiency, outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms.

Conclusion: By combining optimization techniques with machine learning approaches, the proposed RIGEO algorithm addresses job scheduling challenges in Fog computing, resulting in significant improvements in energy efficiency and Quality of Service for IoT applications.

Abstract: The rise of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has led to the development of
numerous applications that require quick responses and low latency. Fog
computing has emerged as a solution for processing these IoT applications, but
it faces challenges such as resource allocation and job scheduling. Therefore,
it is crucial to determine how to assign and schedule tasks on Fog nodes. A
well-designed job scheduling algorithm can help decrease energy usage and
improve response times for application requests. This work aims to schedule
tasks in IoT while minimizing the total energy consumption of nodes and
enhancing the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of IoT tasks, taking into
account task deadlines. Initially, this paper classifies the Fog nodes into two
categories based on their traffic level: low and high. It schedules
low-deadline tasks on low-traffic-level nodes using an Improved Golden Eagle
Optimization (IGEO) algorithm, an enhancement of the Golden Eagle Optimization
Algorithm that utilizes genetic operators for discretization. High-deadline
tasks are processed on high-traffic nodes using reinforcement learning (RL).
This combined approach is called the Reinforcement Improved Golden Eagle
Optimization (RIGEO) algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed algorithms optimize system response time, total deadline violation
time, and resource and system energy consumption compared to other
state-of-the-art algorithms.

*Anjus George,Michael J. Brim,Christopher Zimmer,Tyler J. Skluzacek,A. J. Ruckman,Gustav R. Jansen,Sarp Oral*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper studies messaging parameter configurations and their impact on scientific workflows' streaming requirements, focusing on RabbitMQ in the context of HPC infrastructure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for low latency, high throughput, and reliable data delivery in scientific workflows requiring real-time analysis and experimental control.

Method: Simulations are conducted using synthetic workloads derived from the Deleria and LCLS workflows, implemented with RabbitMQ in the Data Streaming to HPC setup at OLCF.

Result: The simulations reveal throughput trade-offs and practical insights for selecting optimal configurations to meet workflow streaming needs.

Conclusion: Understanding and optimizing messaging framework configurations is crucial for efficient memory-to-memory data streaming in experimental-HPC workflows.

Abstract: Memory-to-memory data streaming is essential for modern scientific workflows
that require near real-time data analysis, experimental steering, and informed
decision-making during experiment execution. It eliminates the latency
bottlenecks associated with file-based transfers to parallel storage, enabling
rapid data movement between experimental facilities and HPC systems. These
tightly coupled experimental-HPC workflows demand low latency, high throughput,
and reliable data delivery to support on-the-fly analysis and timely feedback
for experimental control. Off-the-shelf messaging frameworks are increasingly
considered viable solutions for enabling such direct memory streaming due to
their maturity, broad adoption, and ability to abstract core messaging and
reliability functionalities from the application layer. However, effectively
meeting the workflows' requirements depends on utilizing the framework's
capabilities and carefully tuning its configurations.
  In this paper, we present a study that investigates the messaging parameters,
and their configuration choices that impact the streaming requirements of two
representative scientific workflows. We specifically characterize throughput
trade-offs associated with reliable message transmission for these workflows.
Our study is conducted through streaming simulations using synthetic workloads
derived from the Deleria and LCLS workflows, employing the RabbitMQ messaging
framework within the context of the Data Streaming to HPC infrastructure at
OLCF. Our simulations reveal several key observations and practical insights
that help users understand which configurations best meet the needs of their
streaming workloads.

### [152] [DuoServe-MoE: Dual-Phase Expert Prefetch and Cache Scheduling for Efficient MoE LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07379)
*Yuning Zhang,Grant Pinkert,Nan Yang,Yanli Li,Dong Yuan*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces DuoServe-MoE, a system optimizing inference of Mixture of Experts models, achieving improved latency and memory efficiency by tailoring strategies for prefill and decode stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While Mixture of Experts models enhance LLM capabilities, their inference creates challenges due to high GPU memory pressure and inefficient handling of prefill and decode stages.

Method: DuoServe-MoE separates the two inference stages, using a CUDA pipeline for prefill and a predictor for decode to intelligently manage expert activation and memory usage.

Result: Experiments on various models show DuoServe-MoE achieves latency improvements of up to 7.54x and memory usage reduction to 15% of the full model size.

Conclusion: DuoServe-MoE successfully optimizes inference for MoE models, addressing GPU memory constraints and reducing latency without modifying the underlying models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across
a wide range of deep learning tasks. Mixture of Experts (MoE) further enhances
their capabilities by increasing model width through sparsely activated expert
branches, which keeps inference computation efficient. However, the large
number of expert weights introduces significant GPU memory pressure, especially
in resource-constrained environments such as single-GPU servers. More
importantly, MoE inference consists of two fundamentally different stages: a
prefill stage where most experts are activated densely, and a decode stage
where only a few experts are triggered sparsely. Treating these stages with a
uniform scheduling strategy often leads to suboptimal latency and memory usage.
To address this, we propose DuoServe-MoE, an inference serving system that
explicitly separates prefill and decode stages and applies tailored expert
scheduling strategies to each. In the prefill stage, DuoServe-MoE uses a
two-stream CUDA pipeline that overlaps expert weight prefetching with the
computation of non-MoE layers, limiting expert residency in GPU memory. In the
decode stage, a lightweight layer-level predictor trained offline from
activation traces is used to prefetch only the most likely activated experts,
without requiring any changes to the model. Experiments on 4-bit Mixtral-8x7B
and 8x22B models show that DuoServe-MoE improves end-to-end latency by 1.42 to
7.54 times while keeping peak memory usage at only 15 percent of the full model
size.

*Sanyam Kaul,Manaswini Piduguralla,Gayathri Shreeya Patnala,Sathya Peri*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper proposes a dependency-aware execution model to improve performance in Hyperledger Fabric, a permissioned blockchain framework, achieving 40% higher throughput and lower rejection rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperledger Fabric struggles with high transaction throughput and low rejection rates under heavy workloads due to bottlenecks and resource contention during the commit phase.

Method: The authors propose:
1. Dependency flagging during endorsement.
2. Optimized block construction prioritizing independent transactions.
3. DAG representations of dependencies within each block.
4. Parallel execution of independent transactions and DAG-ordered processing for dependent ones.

Result: The framework showed up to 40% higher transaction throughput and less rejection in high-contention scenarios.

Conclusion: Dependency-aware scheduling and DAG-based execution improve the scalability of Hyperledger Fabric while being compatible with its current design.

Abstract: Hyperledger Fabric is a leading permissioned blockchain framework for
enterprise use, known for its modular design and privacy features. While it
strongly supports configurable consensus and access control, Fabric can face
challenges in achieving high transaction throughput and low rejection rates
under heavy workloads. These performance limitations are often attributed to
endorsement, ordering, and validation bottlenecks. Further, optimistic
concurrency control and deferred validation in Fabric may lead to resource
inefficiencies and contention, as conflicting transactions are identified only
during the commit phase. To address these challenges, we propose a
dependency-aware execution model for Hyperledger Fabric. Our approach includes:
(a) a dependency flagging system during endorsement, marking transactions as
independent or dependent using a hashmap; (b) an optimized block construction
in the ordering service that prioritizes independent transactions; (c) the
incorporation of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) within each block to represent
dependencies; and (d) parallel execution of independent transactions at the
committer, with dependent transactions processed according to DAG order.
Incorporated in Hyperledger Fabric v2.5, our framework was tested on workloads
with varying dependency levels and system loads. Results show up to 40% higher
throughput and significantly reduced rejection rates in high-contention
scenarios. This demonstrates that dependency-aware scheduling and DAG-based
execution can substantially enhance Fabric's scalability while remaining
compatible with its existing consensus and smart contract layers.

*Anjiang Wei,Tianran Sun,Yogesh Seenichamy,Hang Song,Anne Ouyang,Azalia Mirhoseini,Ke Wang,Alex Aiken*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper presents Astra, a multi-agent system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) for GPU kernel optimization, achieving notable performance improvement over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the high difficulty and extensive manual effort required for optimizing GPU kernels, essential for LLM training and serving.

Method: Astra utilizes collaborative LLM agents for iterative processes like code generation, testing, and profiling of GPU kernels starting from existing CUDA implementations rather than high-level PyTorch modules.

Result: Astra demonstrates an average speedup of 1.32x on tested kernels and shows that LLMs can autonomously perform complex optimization steps.

Conclusion: Multi-agent LLM systems represent a promising paradigm for advancing GPU kernel optimization and reducing manual tuning efforts.

Abstract: GPU kernel optimization has long been a central challenge at the intersection
of high-performance computing and machine learning. Efficient kernels are
crucial for accelerating large language model (LLM) training and serving, yet
attaining high performance typically requires extensive manual tuning.
Compiler-based systems reduce some of this burden, but still demand substantial
manual design and engineering effort. Recently, researchers have explored using
LLMs for GPU kernel generation, though prior work has largely focused on
translating high-level PyTorch modules into CUDA code. In this work, we
introduce Astra, the first LLM-based multi-agent system for GPU kernel
optimization. Unlike previous approaches, Astra starts from existing CUDA
implementations extracted from SGLang, a widely deployed framework for serving
LLMs, rather than treating PyTorch modules as the specification. Within Astra,
specialized LLM agents collaborate through iterative code generation, testing,
profiling, and planning to produce kernels that are both correct and
high-performance. On kernels from SGLang, Astra achieves an average speedup of
1.32x using zero-shot prompting with OpenAI o4-mini. A detailed case study
further demonstrates that LLMs can autonomously apply loop transformations,
optimize memory access patterns, exploit CUDA intrinsics, and leverage fast
math operations to yield substantial performance gains. Our work highlights
multi-agent LLM systems as a promising new paradigm for GPU kernel
optimization.

TL;DR: The paper investigates how adjusting HPC compute resources based on electricity price fluctuations can manage energy costs while evaluating potential hardware underutilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the rising energy costs in HPC systems due to volatile electricity markets introduced by green energy sources.

Method: The paper presents a simple model to estimate the trade-off in TCO by dynamically managing HPC capacity using key system parameters.

Result: The model is applied to data from a university HPC cluster to examine different scenarios and how they impact cost-effectiveness.

Conclusion: Variable capacity strategies can lower energy costs but require careful consideration of hardware utilization to ensure cost-effectiveness.

Abstract: Energy costs are a major factor in the total cost of ownership (TCO) for
high-performance computing (HPC) systems. The rise of intermittent green energy
sources and reduced reliance on fossil fuels have introduced volatility into
electricity markets, complicating energy budgeting. This paper explores
variable capacity as a strategy for managing HPC energy costs - dynamically
adjusting compute resources in response to fluctuating electricity prices.
While this approach can lower energy expenses, it risks underutilizing costly
hardware. To evaluate this trade-off, we present a simple model that helps
operators estimate the TCO impact of variable capacity strategies using key
system parameters. We apply this model to real data from a university HPC
cluster and assess how different scenarios could affect the cost-effectiveness
of this approach in the future.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces AgentX, a novel agentic AI workflow pattern designed to improve decision-making and generative processes by utilizing stage designers, planners, and executors, along with Cloud Functions as a Service (FaaS) tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in agentic AI systems, such as managing multiple tools, multi-step tasks, and avoiding hallucinations during long-context tasks.

Method: The paper proposes AgentX, an innovative design that integrates stage designers, planners, and executors with Model Context Protocol tools. It also suggests two deployment methods: cloud-based FaaS and local MCP servers.

Result: Empirical evaluations show AgentX achieves competitive or superior success rates, latency, and cost metrics compared to contemporary methods like ReAct and Magentic One in three practical applications.

Conclusion: AgentX showcases promising advancements in agentic workflows, but also highlights the inherent challenges and opportunities in designing and deploying such systems effectively.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has rapidly transformed various
fields including code generation, text summarization, image generation and so
on. Agentic AI is a recent evolution that further advances this by coupling the
decision making and generative capabilities of LLMs with actions that can be
performed using tools. While seemingly powerful, Agentic systems often struggle
when faced with numerous tools, complex multi-step tasks,and long-context
management to track history and avoid hallucinations. Workflow patterns such as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and ReAct help address this. Here, we define a novel
agentic workflow pattern, AgentX, composed of stage designer, planner, and
executor agents that is competitive or better than the state-of-the-art agentic
patterns. We also leverage Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools, and propose two
alternative approaches for deploying MCP servers as cloud Functions as a
Service (FaaS). We empirically evaluate the success rate, latency and cost for
AgentX and two contemporary agentic patterns, ReAct and Magentic One, using
these the FaaS and local MCP server alternatives for three practical
applications. This highlights the opportunities and challenges of designing and
deploying agentic workflows.

TL;DR: The paper presents TRAM, an efficient atomic multicast protocol for shared memory systems utilizing an overlay tree structure. It significantly enhances performance in terms of throughput and latency compared to existing protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Atomic multicast is critical for ensuring consistency and fault tolerance in systems with replication and sharding. The paper aims to address the limited options available for shared memory systems.

Method: The authors propose TRAM, which uses an overlay tree architecture within shared memory systems to optimize atomic multicast.

Result: TRAM substantially improves performance, achieving over 3× higher throughput and 2.3× lower latency compared to current shared memory-based protocols. It also surpasses message-passing-based protocols by up to 5.9× throughput and 106× latency reduction.

Conclusion: TRAM is a groundbreaking protocol tailored for shared memory environments, offering unmatched efficiency and potential for high scalability in dependable systems.

Abstract: Atomic multicast is a communication primitive used in dependable systems to
ensure consistent ordering of messages delivered to a set of replica groups.
This primitive enables critical services to integrate replication and sharding
(i.e., state partitioning) to achieve fault tolerance and scalability. While
several atomic multicast protocols have been developed for message-passing
systems, only a few are designed for the shared memory system model. This paper
introduces TRAM, an atomic multicast protocol specifically designed for shared
memory systems, leveraging an overlay tree architecture. Due to its simple and
practical design, TRAM delivers exceptional performance, increasing throughput
by more than 3$\times$ and reducing latency by more than 2.3$\times$ compared
to state-of-the-art shared memory-based protocols. Additionally, it
significantly outperforms message-passing-based protocols, boosting throughput
by up to 5.9$\times$ and reducing latency by up to 106$\times$.

TL;DR: VoltanaLLM is a system designed for energy-efficient, latency-aware LLM serving, achieving up to 36.3% energy savings without compromising service quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address rising energy costs associated with large language model (LLM) inference while ensuring seamless performance for interactive applications such as chatbots and code tools.

Method: VoltanaLLM introduces a control-theory-based approach combining dynamic GPU frequency control and intelligent request routing across disaggregated prefill/decode architectures to minimize energy usage under latency constraints.

Result: VoltanaLLM delivers up to 36.3% energy savings while maintaining high service-level objective (SLO) attainment rates, proving its efficiency and reliability in real-world datasets.

Conclusion: VoltanaLLM demonstrates the feasibility of coupling energy efficiency with high-performance requirements in LLM systems, providing a pathway toward sustainable large-scale deployment.

Abstract: Modern Large Language Model (LLM) serving systems increasingly support
interactive applications, like real-time chat assistants, code generation
tools, and agentic workflows. However, the soaring energy cost of LLM inference
presents a growing challenge for sustainable and cost-effective deployment.
This paper introduces VoltanaLLM, a system for SLO-aware, energy-efficient LLM
serving, built from a control theory perspective. VoltanaLLM co-designs
frequency scaling and request routing in emerging prefill/decode disaggregated
architectures, leveraging their decoupled execution to enable fine-grained
phase-specific control. It consists of a feedback-driven frequency controller
that dynamically adapts GPU frequency for prefill and decode phases, and a
state-space router that explores routing decisions across frequency-scaled
instances to minimize energy under latency constraints. We implement VoltanaLLM
in SGLang and evaluate its performance over multiple state-of-the-art LLMs and
real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that VoltanaLLM achieves up to
36.3% energy savings while maintaining near-perfect SLO attainment rate, paving
the way for sustainable and intelligent LLM serving.

*Xueyi Wang,Elisabeth Wilhelm*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes an interpretable and adaptive model for predicting sleep quality using multi-scale convolutional layers, recurrent layers, attention mechanisms, and a two-stage domain adaptation strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop accessible and reliable tools for predicting sleep quality to support preventive healthcare interventions.

Method: The model integrates multi-scale convolutional layers to model spatial interactions, recurrent layers with attention mechanisms for temporal dependencies, and a two-stage domain adaptation strategy to improve generalization during training and testing.

Result: The proposed framework outperformed established forecasting methods like LSTM and TimesNet, achieving a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.216 with a three-day input and one-day prediction window.

Conclusion: The framework offers a robust, adaptive, and explainable solution for predicting sleep quality using sparse wearable device data, demonstrating its practical utility for real-world applications.

Abstract: Sleep quality significantly impacts well-being. Therefore, healthcare
providers and individuals need accessible and reliable forecasting tools for
preventive interventions. This paper introduces an interpretable,
individualized two-stage adaptive spatial-temporal model for predicting sleep
quality scores. Our proposed framework combines multi-scale convolutional
layers to model spatial interactions across multiple input variables, recurrent
layers and attention mechanisms to capture long-term temporal dependencies, and
a two-stage domain adaptation strategy to enhance generalization. The first
adaptation stage is applied during training to mitigate overfitting on the
training set. In the second stage, a source-free test-time adaptation mechanism
is employed to adapt the model to new users without requiring labels. We
conducted various experiments with five input window sizes (3, 5, 7, 9, and 11
days) and five prediction window sizes (1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 days). Our model
consistently outperformed time series forecasting baseline approaches,
including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Informer, PatchTST, and TimesNet. The
best performance was achieved with a three-day input window and a one-day
prediction window, yielding a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.216.
Furthermore, the model demonstrated good predictive performance even for longer
forecasting horizons (e.g, with a 0.257 RMSE for a three-day prediction
window), highlighting its practical utility for real-world applications. We
also conducted an explainability analysis to examine how different features
influence sleep quality. These findings proved that the proposed framework
offers a robust, adaptive, and explainable solution for personalized sleep
forecasting using sparse data from commercial wearable devices.

### [160] [Lookup multivariate Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07103)
*Sergey Pozdnyakov,Philippe Schwaller*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces lookup multivariate Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (lmKANs) as an efficient alternative to high-dimensional linear layers in deep-learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional linear layers consume extensive computational costs and parameters, creating a need for more efficient replacements in deep learning.

Method: The proposed lmKANs utilize trainable low-dimensional multivariate functions designed as spline lookup tables, reducing computational demands while maintaining expressive power.

Result: lmKANs reduced inference FLOPs significantly, enhanced throughput, and maintained accuracy across various datasets and benchmarks, including CNN and tabular data.

Conclusion: lmKANs demonstrate improved efficiency in computational costs and parameter usage without sacrificing model accuracy, indicating their potential for widespread adoption in deep-learning tasks.

Abstract: High-dimensional linear mappings, or linear layers, dominate both the
parameter count and the computational cost of most modern deep-learning models.
We introduce a general drop-in replacement, lookup multivariate
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (lmKANs), which deliver a substantially better
trade-off between capacity and inference cost. Our construction expresses a
general high-dimensional mapping through trainable low-dimensional multivariate
functions. These functions can carry dozens or hundreds of trainable parameters
each, and yet it takes only a few multiplications to compute them because they
are implemented as spline lookup tables. Empirically, lmKANs reduce inference
FLOPs by up to 6.0x while matching the flexibility of MLPs in general
high-dimensional function approximation. In another feedforward fully connected
benchmark, on the tabular-like dataset of randomly displaced methane
configurations, lmKANs enable more than 10x higher H100 throughput at equal
accuracy. Within frameworks of Convolutional Neural Networks, lmKAN-based CNNs
cut inference FLOPs at matched accuracy by 1.6-2.1x and by 1.7x on the CIFAR-10
and ImageNet-1k datasets, respectively. Our code, including dedicated CUDA
kernels, is available online at https://github.com/schwallergroup/lmkan.

### [161] [GSTBench: A Benchmark Study on the Transferability of Graph Self-Supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06975)
*Yu Song,Zhigang Hua,Yan Xie,Jingzhe Liu,Bo Long,Hui Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GSTBench, a benchmark for evaluating the transferability of graph SSL methods, highlighting that most struggle with generalization except for GraphMAE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of studies on the transferability of graph SSL methods across datasets, hindering the development of generalized intelligence and large-scale pretraining in graph learning.

Method: The authors developed GSTBench and conducted large-scale pretraining on ogbn-papers100M, systematically evaluating five SSL methods while controlling for confounding factors.

Result: Most graph SSL methods failed to generalize across datasets, sometimes underperforming compared to random initialization, but GraphMAE notably excelled in transfer performance.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes the need for further research on transferable graph SSL, positioning GSTBench as a standardized starting point for advancing the 'pretrain-then-transfer' paradigm.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown great promise in graph
representation learning. However, most existing graph SSL methods are developed
and evaluated under a single-dataset setting, leaving their cross-dataset
transferability largely unexplored and limiting their ability to leverage
knowledge transfer and large-scale pretraining, factors that are critical for
developing generalized intelligence beyond fitting training data. To address
this gap and advance foundation model research for graphs, we present GSTBench,
the first systematic benchmark for evaluating the transferability of graph SSL
methods. We conduct large-scale pretraining on ogbn-papers100M and evaluate
five representative SSL methods across a diverse set of target graphs. Our
standardized experimental setup decouples confounding factors such as model
architecture, dataset characteristics, and adaptation protocols, enabling
rigorous comparisons focused solely on pretraining objectives. Surprisingly, we
observe that most graph SSL methods struggle to generalize, with some
performing worse than random initialization. In contrast, GraphMAE, a masked
autoencoder approach, consistently improves transfer performance. We analyze
the underlying factors that drive these differences and offer insights to guide
future research on transferable graph SSL, laying a solid foundation for the
"pretrain-then-transfer" paradigm in graph learning. Our code is available at

### [162] [A Knowledge-Guided Cross-Modal Feature Fusion Model for Local Traffic Demand Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06976)
*Lingyu Zhang,Pengfei Xu,Guobin Wu,Jian Liang,Ruiyang Dong,Yunhai Wang,Xuan Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the KGCM model for traffic demand prediction by integrating temporal traffic data with textual representations of human knowledge and experience, achieving better accuracy than existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance urban traffic demand forecasting by incorporating human knowledge and experience, as real-world traffic prediction is shaped significantly by such contextual insights.

Method: The method involves constructing a prior knowledge dataset using large language models and manual curation, and designing the KGCM model with adaptive graph networks and a cross-modal feature fusion mechanism, supported by a dynamic parameter update strategy.

Result: Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate increased prediction accuracy and robustness, with the KGCM model outperforming state-of-the-art traffic prediction models.

Conclusion: Integrating human-derived knowledge with structured traffic data improves the precision and adaptability of traffic demand predictions, showcasing the potential of knowledge-guided approaches for real-world applications.

Abstract: Traffic demand prediction plays a critical role in intelligent transportation
systems. Existing traffic prediction models primarily rely on temporal traffic
data, with limited efforts incorporating human knowledge and experience for
urban traffic demand forecasting. However, in real-world scenarios, traffic
knowledge and experience derived from human daily life significantly influence
precise traffic prediction. Such knowledge and experiences can guide the model
in uncovering latent patterns within traffic data, thereby enhancing the
accuracy and robustness of predictions. To this end, this paper proposes
integrating structured temporal traffic data with textual data representing
human knowledge and experience, resulting in a novel knowledge-guided
cross-modal feature representation learning (KGCM) model for traffic demand
prediction. Based on regional transportation characteristics, we construct a
prior knowledge dataset using a large language model combined with manual
authoring and revision, covering both regional and global knowledge and
experiences. The KGCM model then learns multimodal data features through
designed local and global adaptive graph networks, as well as a cross-modal
feature fusion mechanism. A proposed reasoning-based dynamic update strategy
enables dynamic optimization of the graph model's parameters, achieving optimal
performance. Experiments on multiple traffic datasets demonstrate that our
model accurately predicts future traffic demand and outperforms existing
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.

### [163] [Toward Reproducible Cross-Backend Compatibility for Deep Learning: A Configuration-First Framework with Three-Tier Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06977)
*Zehua Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a configuration-first framework for evaluating cross-backend compatibility in deep learning systems, highlighting and addressing sources of discrepancies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address cross-backend drift in deep learning deployments and provide a systematic methodology for dependable evaluation and deployment across heterogeneous runtimes.

Method: Developed a framework using YAML for experiment decoupling, library and repository models, and a three-tier verification protocol covering tensor closeness, activation alignment, and task-level metrics.

Result: Through 672 checks, 72.0% of runs passed, revealing issues with stricter thresholds, detection models, and compiled runtimes.

Conclusion: The framework effectively quantifies and mitigates drift using deterministic adapters and selective fallbacks, paving the way for reliable deployment across diverse backends.

Abstract: This paper presents a configuration-first framework for evaluating
cross-backend compatibility in deep learning systems deployed on CPU, GPU, and
compiled runtimes. The framework decouples experiments from code using YAML,
supports both library and repository models, and employs a three-tier
verification protocol covering tensor-level closeness, activation alignment,
and task-level metrics. Through 672 checks across multiple models and tolerance
settings, we observe that 72.0% of runs pass, with most discrepancies occurring
under stricter thresholds. Our results show that detection models and compiled
backends are particularly prone to drift, often due to nondeterministic
post-processing. We further demonstrate that deterministic adapters and
selective fallbacks can substantially improve agreement without significant
performance loss. To our knowledge, this is the first unified framework that
systematically quantifies and mitigates cross-backend drift in deep learning,
providing a reproducible methodology for dependable deployment across
heterogeneous runtimes.

### [164] [A Kriging-HDMR-based surrogate model with sample pool-free active learning strategy for reliability analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06978)
*Wenxiong Li,Hanyu Liao,Suiyin Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study introduces an advanced surrogate modeling method combining Kriging and HDMR for reliability analysis, addressing high-dimensional challenges efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing surrogate models struggle with high-dimensionality, especially in reliability analysis where accuracy in critical regions is paramount.

Method: The method constructs high-dimensional limit state functions using Kriging-HDMR, combining low-dimensional sub-surrogate models through a staged framework.

Result: The proposed approach yields high computational efficiency and strong predictive accuracy in high-dimensional reliability problems.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses the curse of dimensionality, optimizing performance in reliability engineering applications.

Abstract: In reliability engineering, conventional surrogate models encounter the
"curse of dimensionality" as the number of random variables increases. While
the active learning Kriging surrogate approaches with high-dimensional model
representation (HDMR) enable effective approximation of high-dimensional
functions and are widely applied to optimization problems, there are rare
studies specifically focused on reliability analysis, which prioritizes
prediction accuracy in critical regions over uniform accuracy across the entire
domain. This study develops an active learning surrogate model method based on
the Kriging-HDMR modeling for reliability analysis. The proposed approach
facilitates the approximation of high-dimensional limit state functions through
a composite representation constructed from multiple low-dimensional
sub-surrogate models. The architecture of the surrogate modeling framework
comprises three distinct stages: developing single-variable sub-surrogate
models for all random variables, identifying the requirements for
coupling-variable sub-surrogate models, and constructing the coupling-variable
sub-surrogate models. Optimization mathematical models for selection of design
of experiment samples are formulated based on each stage's characteristics,
with objectives incorporating uncertainty variance, predicted mean, sample
location and inter-sample distances. A candidate sample pool-free approach is
adopted to achieve the selection of informative samples. Numerical experiments
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high computational efficiency
while maintaining strong predictive accuracy in solving high-dimensional
reliability problems.

### [165] [Exploring Over-stationarization in Deep Learning-based Bus/Tram Arrival Time Prediction: Analysis and Non-stationary Effect Recovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06979)
*Zirui Li,Bin Yang,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a deep learning approach for improving multi-step arrival time prediction of public transport while addressing non-stationary data issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving multi-step arrival time prediction of public transit by addressing performance degradation caused by non-stationary data.

Method: Proposes the NSATP model with two stages – series stationarization for predictability and non-stationarity effect recovery for compensating over-stationarization.

Result: NSATP achieves superior accuracy in public transport prediction with RMSE, MAE, and MAPE reductions for trams (2.37%, 1.22%, 2.26%) and buses (1.72%, 0.60%, 1.17%).

Conclusion: NSATP effectively balances predictability and non-stationarity, outperforming baseline methods in public transport arrival time forecasting.

Abstract: Arrival time prediction (ATP) of public transport vehicles is essential in
improving passenger experience and supporting traffic management. Deep learning
has demonstrated outstanding performance in ATP due to its ability to model
non-linear and temporal dynamics. In the multi-step ATP, non-stationary data
will degrade the model performance due to the variation in variables' joint
distribution along the temporal direction. Previous studies mainly applied
normalization to eliminate the non-stationarity in time series, thereby
achieving better predictability. However, the normalization may obscure useful
characteristics inherent in non-stationarity, which is known as the
over-stationarization. In this work, to trade off predictability and
non-stationarity, a new approach for multi-step ATP, named non-stationary ATP (
NSATP), is proposed. The method consists of two stages: series stationarization
and non-stationarity effect recovery. The first stage aims at improving the
predictability. As for the latter, NSATP extends a state-of-the-art method from
one-dimensional to two dimensional based models to capture the hidden
periodicity in time series and designs a compensation module of
over-stationarization by learning scaling and shifting factors from raw data.
125 days' public transport operational data of Dresden is collected for
validation. Experimental results show that compared to baseline methods, the
proposed NSATP can reduce RMSE, MAE, and MAPE by 2.37%, 1.22%, and 2.26% for
trams and by 1.72%, 0.60%, and 1.17% for buses, respectively.

### [166] [A Minimalist Bayesian Framework for Stochastic Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07030)
*Kaizheng Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a minimalist Bayesian framework focusing on the component of interest in optimization problems while eliminating nuisance parameters via profile likelihood handling constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bayesian methods face challenges when incorporating complex structural constraints due to their reliance on a probabilistic model for all parameters.

Method: The authors introduced a Bayesian framework that implements profile likelihood to eliminate nuisance parameters and developed the MINTS algorithm for structured problems.

Result: The MINTS algorithm shows near-optimal regret guarantees in multi-armed bandits and accommodates various structured optimization problems like continuum-armed Lipschitz bandits and dynamic pricing.

Conclusion: This minimalist Bayesian approach provides an efficient tool for decision-making in constrained and structured problems while bridging Bayesian principles and classical optimization.

Abstract: The Bayesian paradigm offers principled tools for sequential decision-making
under uncertainty, but its reliance on a probabilistic model for all parameters
can hinder the incorporation of complex structural constraints. We introduce a
minimalist Bayesian framework that places a prior only on the component of
interest, such as the location of the optimum. Nuisance parameters are
eliminated via profile likelihood, which naturally handles constraints. As a
direct instantiation, we develop a MINimalist Thompson Sampling (MINTS)
algorithm. Our framework accommodates structured problems, including
continuum-armed Lipschitz bandits and dynamic pricing. It also provides a
probabilistic lens on classical convex optimization algorithms such as the
center of gravity and ellipsoid methods. We further analyze MINTS for
multi-armed bandits and establish near-optimal regret guarantees.

*Jiajun Chai,Guojun Yin,Zekun Xu,Chuhuai Yue,Yi Jia,Siyu Xia,Xiaohan Wang,Jiwen Jiang,Xiaoguang Li,Chengqi Dong,Hang He,Wei Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLFactory is a framework for post-training reinforcement learning aimed at improving large language models’ multi-round tool use. It integrates tool-call stability, diverse evaluation methods, and dynamic policy optimization, showing both performance improvements and increased training throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large language models face limitations in tasks that require interacting with external tools, especially in multi-step operations. This paper seeks to bridge these gaps by creating a flexible framework to enhance LLMs’ tool utilization.

Method: RLFactory employs an asyncio-based asynchronous caller and a decoupled architecture to handle diverse tools and interfaces. It introduces observation markers for reconstructed MDPs and utilizes a generate-parse-invoke-update workflow, allowing for dynamic reinforcement learning optimization.

Result: Using RLFactory on Search-R1 with Qwen3-4B, the framework achieved a 0.486 test score on the Natural Questions dataset, outperforming alternate models like Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-GRPO. It also increased training throughput by 6.8x.

Conclusion: RLFactory demonstrates effectiveness in enhancing LLMs' multi-round tool use with measurable improvements in performance and training efficiency. It is positioned as a practical and adaptable solution for real-world applications.

Abstract: Large language models excel at basic reasoning but struggle with tasks that
require interaction with external tools. We present RLFactory, a plug-and-play
reinforcement learning post-training framework for multi-round tool use.
RLFactory tackles (i) tool-call stability and adaptability amid tool
heterogeneity and interface issues via an asyncio-based asynchronous caller and
a decoupled tool/training architecture, and (ii) diverse evaluation needs via a
reward layer supporting rule-based, model-judgment, and tool-verification
signals. It reconstructs the MDP by introducing observation markers from tool
feedback, closing the loop among model, tools, and environment, and implements
a generate-parse-invoke-update workflow for dynamic policy optimization. On
Search-R1 with Qwen3-4B, RLFactory achieves a 0.486 test score on the Natural
Questions (NQ) dataset, surpassing larger models trained with similar
techniques (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-GRPO at 0.473), and increases training
throughput by 6.8x. RLFactory provides a low-barrier, highly adaptable
framework for strengthening multi-round tool use of LLMs in real-world
scenarios. Code: https://github.com/Simple-Efficient/RL-Factory.

### [168] [CARE: Decoding Time Safety Alignment via Rollback and Introspection Intervention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06982)
*Xiaomeng Hu,Fei Huang,Chenhan Yuan,Junyang Lin,Tsung-Yi Ho*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces CARE, a framework to enhance safety during decoding in large language models without compromising response quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring safe outputs from LLMs during decoding is challenging, especially without sacrificing user experience or response quality.

Method: CARE combines a guard model for real-time safety monitoring, a rollback mechanism for early corrections, and introspection-based interventions for self-reflective critiques to guide subsequent outputs.

Result: The framework demonstrated improved safety-quality trade-off, reducing harmful response rates while maintaining high response quality and user experience.

Conclusion: The approach presents a promising solution for real-time safety alignment in LLMs, balancing safety, quality, and efficiency to enhance practical deployment.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, ensuring the safety of their outputs during decoding has become a
critical challenge. However, existing decoding-time interventions, such as
Contrastive Decoding, often force a severe trade-off between safety and
response quality. In this work, we propose CARE, a novel framework for
decoding-time safety alignment that integrates three key components: (1) a
guard model for real-time safety monitoring, enabling detection of potentially
unsafe content; (2) a rollback mechanism with a token buffer to correct unsafe
outputs efficiently at an earlier stage without disrupting the user experience;
and (3) a novel introspection-based intervention strategy, where the model
generates self-reflective critiques of its previous outputs and incorporates
these reflections into the context to guide subsequent decoding steps. The
framework achieves a superior safety-quality trade-off by using its guard model
for precise interventions, its rollback mechanism for timely corrections, and
our novel introspection method for effective self-correction. Experimental
results demonstrate that our framework achieves a superior balance of safety,
quality, and efficiency, attaining a low harmful response rate and minimal
disruption to the user experience while maintaining high response quality.

*Lishan Yang,Nam Kha Nguygen,Po Hu,Wei Emma Zhang,Yanjun Shu,Mong Yuan Sim,Weitong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FediLoRA addresses challenges in federated multimodal fine-tuning by handling heterogeneous client LoRA ranks and missing data modalities, outperforming competitive baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying foundation models is challenging in decentralized environments due to their large parameter sizes, and existing methods fail to address client heterogeneity and multimodal data incompleteness.

Method: FediLoRA uses dimension-wise aggregation to reweight updates without information dilution and employs layer-wise model editing to repair local components using global parameters.

Result: Experimental results on three multimodal datasets show superior performance in both global and personalized settings, even with incomplete modalities.

Conclusion: FediLoRA effectively improves global and client-side model performances, making it a robust solution for federated learning under real-world constraints.

Abstract: Foundation models have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide
range of tasks, yet their large parameter sizes pose challenges for practical
deployment, especially in decentralized environments. Parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT), such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), reduces local computing
and memory overhead, making it attractive for federated learning. However,
existing federated LoRA methods typically assume uniform rank configurations
and unimodal inputs, overlooking two key real-world challenges: (1)
heterogeneous client resources have different LoRA ranks, and (2) multimodal
data settings with potentially missing modalities. In this work, we propose
FediLoRA, a simple yet effective framework for federated multimodal fine-tuning
under heterogeneous LoRA ranks and missing modalities. FediLoRA introduces a
dimension-wise aggregation strategy that reweights LoRA updates without
information dilution during aggregation. It also includes a lightweight
layer-wise model editing method that selectively incorporates global parameters
to repair local components which improves both client and global model
performances. Experimental results on three multimodal benchmark datasets
demonstrate that FediLoRA achieves superior performance over competitive
baselines in both global and personalized settings, particularly in the
presence of modality incompleteness.

*Zakeria Sharif Ali*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Univariate Gaussian Mixture Model Neural Network (uGMM-NN) to incorporate probabilistic reasoning at the neuron level in deep networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research seeks to enhance neural networks by enabling them to capture multimodality and uncertainty at the individual neuron level, which traditional architectures lack.

Method: The uGMM-NN introduces neurons that model activations as univariate Gaussian mixtures with learnable parameters (means, variances, and mixing coefficients).

Result: The uGMM-NN achieves competitive discriminative performance akin to conventional multilayer perceptrons while providing probabilistic activation interpretations.

Conclusion: This framework integrates uncertainty-aware components in deep learning and paves the way for new possibilities in both discriminative and generative models.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Univariate Gaussian Mixture Model Neural Network
(uGMM-NN), a novel neural architecture that embeds probabilistic reasoning
directly into the computational units of deep networks. Unlike traditional
neurons, which apply weighted sums followed by fixed nonlinearities, each
uGMM-NN node parameterizes its activations as a univariate Gaussian mixture,
with learnable means, variances, and mixing coefficients. This design enables
richer representations by capturing multimodality and uncertainty at the level
of individual neurons, while retaining the scalability of standard feedforward
networks. We demonstrate that uGMM-NN can achieve competitive discriminative
performance compared to conventional multilayer perceptrons, while additionally
offering a probabilistic interpretation of activations. The proposed framework
provides a foundation for integrating uncertainty-aware components into modern
neural architectures, opening new directions for both discriminative and
generative modeling.

*Sima Najafzadehkhoei,George Vega Yon,Bernardo Modenesi,Derek S. Meyer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a machine learning-based approach to efficiently calibrate agent-based epidemic models by mapping epidemic time series to SIR parameters using LSTM and achieving notable performance improvements over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Epidemic model calibration is computationally expensive and traditional methods like Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) are time-intensive and error-prone for certain parameters.

Method: A supervised machine learning calibrator with a three-layer bidirectional LSTM processes 60-day incidence data, population size, and recovery rate to predict SIR model parameters. The training involves a composite loss function, including a consistency penalty ensuring epidemiologically sound predictions.

Result: The machine learning method outperformed ABC in terms of error reduction (e.g., MAE for R0 was 0.0616 vs 0.275) and computational efficiency (wall clock time reduced from 77.4 seconds to 2.35 seconds per calibration). It also produced tighter predictive intervals and generated epidemic curves more faithfully.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers faster, more accurate, and practical calibration for agent-based epidemic models, overcoming limitations of traditional methods like ABC.

Abstract: Calibrating agent-based epidemic models is computationally demanding. We
present a supervised machine learning calibrator that learns the inverse
mapping from epidemic time series to SIR parameters. A three-layer
bidirectional LSTM ingests 60-day incidence together with population size and
recovery rate, and outputs transmission probability, contact rate, and R0.
Training uses a composite loss with an epidemiology-motivated consistency
penalty that encourages R0 \* recovery rate to equal transmission probability
\* contact rate.
  In a 1000-scenario simulation study, we compare the calibrator with
Approximate Bayesian Computation (likelihood-free MCMC). The method achieves
lower error across all targets (MAE: R0 0.0616 vs 0.275; transmission 0.0715 vs
0.128; contact 1.02 vs 4.24), produces tighter predictive intervals with near
nominal coverage, and reduces wall clock time from 77.4 s to 2.35 s per
calibration. Although contact rate and transmission probability are partially
nonidentifiable, the approach reproduces epidemic curves more faithfully than
ABC, enabling fast and practical calibration. We evaluate it on SIR agent based
epidemics generated with epiworldR and provide an implementation in R.

*Xinquan Wu,Xuefeng Yan,Mingqiang Wei,Donghai Guan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel DRL environment and scheduling model for FJSP based on PPO, resulting in competitive solutions against various traditional and DRL methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DRL methods for FJSP focus on agent design but lack emphasis on the modeling of the DRL environment.

Method: Proposed an end-to-end DRL scheduling model using PPO, a simple chronological DRL environment utilizing discrete event simulation, a short state representation, and a comprehensible reward function.

Result: Experimental results reveal enhanced performance of priority dispatching rules in the proposed environment and competitive results when compared to OR-Tools, meta-heuristics, and other DRL methods.

Conclusion: The proposed DRL environment and scheduling model for FJSP provide an effective approach to solving scheduling problems, bridging gaps in current DRL-based strategies.

Abstract: The Flexible Job-shop Scheduling Problem (FJSP) is a classical combinatorial
optimization problem that has a wide-range of applications in the real world.
In order to generate fast and accurate scheduling solutions for FJSP, various
deep reinforcement learning (DRL) scheduling methods have been developed.
However, these methods are mainly focused on the design of DRL scheduling
Agent, overlooking the modeling of DRL environment. This paper presents a
simple chronological DRL environment for FJSP based on discrete event
simulation and an end-to-end DRL scheduling model is proposed based on the
proximal policy optimization (PPO). Furthermore, a short novel state
representation of FJSP is proposed based on two state variables in the
scheduling environment and a novel comprehensible reward function is designed
based on the scheduling area of machines. Experimental results on public
benchmark instances show that the performance of simple priority dispatching
rules (PDR) is improved in our scheduling environment and our DRL scheduling
model obtains competing performance compared with OR-Tools, meta-heuristic, DRL
and PDR scheduling methods.

*Eduardo Lobo Lustoda Cabral,Paulo Pirozelli,Larissa Driemeier*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new type of neural network layers called binary normalized layers, where all parameters are restricted to binary values (0 or 1) to drastically reduce memory usage while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The computational and memory demands of large neural network models make their deployment challenging, creating a need for more efficient techniques.

Method: The authors propose binary normalized layers, where all parameters (like kernel weights and biases) are binary (0 or 1). These layers are implemented as slight modifications to existing layer types (e.g., fully connected, convolutional, attention).

Result: Experiments demonstrate that models with binary normalized layers maintain nearly identical performance to 32-bit parameter models, with a 32x reduction in memory usage.

Conclusion: Binary normalized layers enable efficient and practical neural network deployment, reducing memory requirements while maintaining high performance, making large models more accessible on inexpensive hardware like CPUs or mobile devices.

Abstract: The increasing size of large neural network models, specifically language
models and foundational image models, poses deployment challenges, prompting
efforts to reduce memory requirements and enhance computational efficiency.
These efforts are critical to ensure practical deployment and effective
utilization of these models across various applications. In this work, a novel
type of neural network layers and models is developed that uses only single-bit
parameters. In this novel type of models all parameters of all layers,
including kernel weights and biases, only have values equal to zero or one.
This novel type of models uses layers named as binary normalized layer. These
binary normalized layers can be of any type, such as fully connected,
convolutional, attention, etc., and they consist of slight variations of the
corresponding conventional layers. To show the effectiveness of the binary
normalized layers, two different models are configured to solve a multiclass
image classification problem and a language decoder to predict the next token
of a sequence. The model to solve the image classification has convolutional
and fully connected layers, and the language model is composed of transformer
blocks with multi-head attention. The results show that models with binary
normalized layers present almost the same results obtained by equivalent models
with real 32-bit parameters. The binary normalized layers allow to develop
models that use 32 times less memory than current models and have equivalent
performance. Besides, the binary normalized layers can be easily implemented on
current computers using 1-bit arrays, and do not require the development of
dedicated electronic hardware. This novel type of layers opens a new era for
large neural network models with reduced memory requirements that can be
deployed using simple and cheap hardware, such as mobile devices or only cpus.

### [174] [Fed-REACT: Federated Representation Learning for Heterogeneous and Evolving Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07198)
*Yiyue Chen,Usman Akram,Chianing Wang,Haris Vikalo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Fed-REACT, a federated learning framework optimized for evolving and heterogeneous client data by using representation learning and evolutionary clustering to improve model accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges posed by resource costs, privacy concerns, and performance degradation in federated learning due to heterogeneous and evolving client data distributions.

Method: Fed-REACT operates in two stages: first, each client extracts feature representations locally; second, the server groups clients into clusters based on these representations for cluster-wise training on specific tasks.

Result: Fed-REACT is shown to deliver superior accuracy and robustness, validated both theoretically and empirically on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The study concludes that Fed-REACT is a scalable and effective solution for federated learning in real-world scenarios with dynamic and varied data distributions.

Abstract: Motivated by the high resource costs and privacy concerns associated with
centralized machine learning, federated learning (FL) has emerged as an
efficient alternative that enables clients to collaboratively train a global
model while keeping their data local. However, in real-world deployments,
client data distributions often evolve over time and differ significantly
across clients, introducing heterogeneity that degrades the performance of
standard FL algorithms. In this work, we introduce Fed-REACT, a federated
learning framework designed for heterogeneous and evolving client data.
Fed-REACT combines representation learning with evolutionary clustering in a
two-stage process: (1) in the first stage, each client learns a local model to
extracts feature representations from its data; (2) in the second stage, the
server dynamically groups clients into clusters based on these representations
and coordinates cluster-wise training of task-specific models for downstream
objectives such as classification or regression. We provide a theoretical
analysis of the representation learning stage, and empirically demonstrate that
Fed-REACT achieves superior accuracy and robustness on real-world datasets.

### [175] [Recursive State Inference for Linear PASFA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07028)
*Vishal Rishi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a recursive extension to Probabilistic Adaptive Slow Feature Analysis (PASFA) for effectively estimating slow features using MMSE, avoiding limitations of Kalman filter-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient methods are needed to infer slow features in classification tasks using PASFA models, as current approaches like Kalman filters struggle to recover original states.

Method: A recursive MMSE estimation method is introduced for deducing ARMA process-based slow features directly from observations and the PASFA model.

Result: The technique is validated on a synthetic dataset, showcasing its correctness and efficiency.

Conclusion: The recursive approach offers an improvement over Kalman filter methods, allowing recovery of original slow features, enhancing PASFA's applicability in signal analysis and classification.

Abstract: Slow feature analysis (SFA), as a method for learning slowly varying features
in classification and signal analysis, has attracted increasing attention in
recent years. Recent probabilistic extensions to SFA learn effective
representations for classification tasks. Notably, the Probabilistic Adaptive
Slow Feature Analysis models the slow features as states in an ARMA process and
estimate the model from the observations. However, there is a need to develop
efficient methods to infer the states (slow features) from the observations and
the model. In this paper, a recursive extension to the linear PASFA has been
proposed. The proposed algorithm performs MMSE estimation of states evolving
according to an ARMA process, given the observations and the model. Although
current methods tackle this problem using Kalman filters after transforming the
ARMA process into a state space model, the original states (or slow features)
that form useful representations cannot be easily recovered. The proposed
technique is evaluated on a synthetic dataset to demonstrate its correctness.

### [176] [FedTeddi: Temporal Drift and Divergence Aware Scheduling for Timely Federated Edge Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07342)
*Yuxuan Bai,Yuxuan Sun,Tan Chen,Wei Chen,Sheng Zhou,Zhisheng Niu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedTeddi is a scheduling algorithm designed for federated edge learning (FEEL) to handle dynamic, time-varying, and non-i.i.d. data efficiently, leveraging temporal drift and collective divergence metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Client datasets in federated learning are often assumed static, but in real-world scenarios, data is dynamic and non-i.i.d., requiring adaptable models for evolving data.

Method: FedTeddi quantifies data evolution using temporal drift and divergence based on Earth Mover's Distance, and introduces a joint scheduling and bandwidth allocation optimized for fast adaptation and retention of knowledge.

Result: FedTeddi demonstrated faster convergence and higher test accuracy over benchmarks, achieving a 58.4% faster convergence on CIFAR-10 and 49.2% on CIFAR-100.

Conclusion: FedTeddi effectively balances adaptation to new data and knowledge retention, achieving efficient and accurate federated learning in dynamic, non-i.i.d. environments.

Abstract: Federated edge learning (FEEL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients over wireless networks without exposing raw data. While
most existing studies assume static datasets, in real-world scenarios clients
may continuously collect data with time-varying and non-independent and
identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) characteristics. A critical challenge is
how to adapt models in a timely yet efficient manner to such evolving data. In
this paper, we propose FedTeddi, a temporal-drift-and-divergence-aware
scheduling algorithm that facilitates fast convergence of FEEL under dynamic
data evolution and communication resource limits. We first quantify the
temporal dynamics and non-i.i.d. characteristics of data using temporal drift
and collective divergence, respectively, and represent them as the Earth
Mover's Distance (EMD) of class distributions for classification tasks. We then
propose a novel optimization objective and develop a joint scheduling and
bandwidth allocation algorithm, enabling the FEEL system to learn from new data
quickly without forgetting previous knowledge. Experimental results show that
our algorithm achieves higher test accuracy and faster convergence compared to
benchmark methods, improving the rate of convergence by 58.4% on CIFAR-10 and
49.2% on CIFAR-100 compared to random scheduling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper combines causal discovery and uncertainty-aware forecasting to analyze U.S. macroeconomic indicators using advanced frameworks, achieving accurate unemployment predictions and revealing key causal links.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve financial time series analysis for key macroeconomic indicators by integrating causal discovery and forecasting methods.

Method: The study applies the LPCMCI framework with Gaussian Process Distance Correlation (GPDC) for causal discovery and uses the Chronos framework for zero-shot probabilistic forecasts on unemployment.

Result: A causal link from economic growth to GDP is identified, inflation shows limited connectivity due to latent factors, and unemployment forecasts achieved high accuracy with effective anomaly detection.

Conclusion: This combined approach enhances the robustness of economic forecasting and supports informed economic policymaking, highlighting the utility of causal and probabilistic models.

Abstract: This paper presents a methodological approach to financial time series
analysis by combining causal discovery and uncertainty-aware forecasting. As a
case study, we focus on four key U.S. macroeconomic indicators -- GDP, economic
growth, inflation, and unemployment -- and we apply the LPCMCI framework with
Gaussian Process Distance Correlation (GPDC) to uncover dynamic causal
relationships in quarterly data from 1970 to 2021. Our results reveal a robust
unidirectional causal link from economic growth to GDP and highlight the
limited connectivity of inflation, suggesting the influence of latent factors.
Unemployment exhibits strong autoregressive dependence, motivating its use as a
case study for probabilistic forecasting. Leveraging the Chronos framework, a
large language model trained for time series, we perform zero-shot predictions
on unemployment. This approach delivers accurate forecasts one and two quarters
ahead, without requiring task-specific training. Crucially, the model's
uncertainty-aware predictions yield 90\% confidence intervals, enabling
effective anomaly detection through statistically principled deviation
analysis. This study demonstrates the value of combining causal structure
learning with probabilistic language models to inform economic policy and
enhance forecasting robustness.

*Songkai Ma,Zhaorui Zhang,Sheng Di,Benben Liu,Xiaodong Yu,Xiaoyi Lu,Dan Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of serving Mixture of Experts (MoE) models under limited GPU memory by proposing error-bounded lossy compression for efficient expert offloading.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient inference of MoE reasoning models when GPU memory constraints are present, and to understand the impact of compression error on accuracy.

Method: The approach involves using error-bounded lossy compression algorithms (SZ3 and CuSZp) to compress non-activated experts during model inference.

Result: The study shows that shallow experts have minimal accuracy degradation under compression errors, middle-layer experts are highly sensitive, and deep-layer errors can sometimes improve accuracy.

Conclusion: Error-bounded lossy compression is an effective technique for transferring non-activated experts, allowing efficient MoE inference under GPU constraints, with specific error impacts varying by layer.

Abstract: With the widespread application of Mixture of Experts (MoE) reasoning models
in the field of LLM learning, efficiently serving MoE models under limited GPU
memory constraints has emerged as a significant challenge. Offloading the
non-activated experts to main memory has been identified as an efficient
approach to address such a problem, while it brings the challenges of
transferring the expert between the GPU memory and main memory. We need to
explore an efficient approach to compress the expert and analyze how the
compression error affects the inference performance.
  To bridge this gap, we propose employing error-bounded lossy compression
algorithms (such as SZ3 and CuSZp) to compress non-activated experts, thereby
reducing data transfer overhead during MoE inference. We conduct extensive
experiments across various benchmarks and present a comprehensive analysis of
how compression-induced errors in different experts affect overall inference
accuracy. The results indicate that experts in the shallow layers, which are
primarily responsible for the attention mechanism and the transformation of
input tokens into vector representations, exhibit minimal degradation in
inference accuracy when subjected to bounded errors. In contrast, errors in the
middle-layer experts, which are central to model reasoning, significantly
impair inference accuracy. Interestingly, introducing bounded errors in the
deep-layer experts, which are mainly responsible for instruction following and
output integration, can sometimes lead to improvements in inference accuracy.

*Serra Aksoy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper compares CNNs and vision transformers for detecting thermal photovoltaic (PV) faults, achieving high accuracy but noting performance limitations for certain fault types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address interpretability challenges that hinder AI adoption in automated PV monitoring and ensure model decisions align with thermal physics for deployment trustworthiness.

Method: Systematic comparison of CNNs (ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0) and vision transformers (ViT-Tiny, Swin-Tiny) using XRAI saliency analysis on 20,000 infrared images.

Result: Swin Transformer achieved top performance (94% binary accuracy, 73% multiclass accuracy), with models learning physically relevant features; environmental fault detection remains challenging.

Conclusion: Thermal physics-guided interpretability confirms models' decision alignment with physical principles, aiding AI integration into renewable energy monitoring systems.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence deployment for automated photovoltaic (PV) monitoring
faces interpretability barriers that limit adoption in energy infrastructure
applications. While deep learning achieves high accuracy in thermal fault
detection, validation that model decisions align with thermal physics
principles remains lacking, creating deployment hesitancy where understanding
model reasoning is critical. This study provides a systematic comparison of
convolutional neural networks (ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0) and vision
transformers (ViT-Tiny, Swin-Tiny) for thermal PV fault detection, using XRAI
saliency analysis to assess alignment with thermal physics principles. This
represents the first systematic comparison of CNNs and vision transformers for
thermal PV fault detection with physics-validated interpretability. Evaluation
on 20,000 infrared images spanning normal operation and 11 fault categories
shows that Swin Transformer achieves the highest performance (94% binary
accuracy; 73% multiclass accuracy) compared to CNN approaches. XRAI analysis
reveals that models learn physically meaningful features, such as localized
hotspots for cell defects, linear thermal paths for diode failures, and thermal
boundaries for vegetation shading, consistent with expected thermal signatures.
However, performance varies significantly across fault types: electrical faults
achieve strong detection (F1-scores >0.90) while environmental factors like
soiling remain challenging (F1-scores 0.20-0.33), indicating limitations
imposed by thermal imaging resolution. The thermal physics-guided
interpretability approach provides methodology for validating AI
decision-making in energy monitoring applications, addressing deployment
barriers in renewable energy infrastructure.

*Ziheng Chen,Xiao-Jun Wu,Nicu Sebe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GyroBN, a Riemannian batch normalization method for gyrogroups, addressing normalization on non-Euclidean domains in deep learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend Euclidean-based deep learning normalization methods to non-Euclidean manifolds, applicable in machine learning domains with Riemannian structures.

Method: The paper introduces GyroBN, a batch normalization framework based on gyro-structures, with theoretical control via pseudo-reduction and gyroisometric gyrations, validated across multiple geometries.

Result: GyroBN is instantiated across seven geometries, including the Grassmannian and constant curvature spaces, showing enhanced effectiveness experimentally.

Conclusion: GyroBN provides a robust normalization solution for Riemannian manifolds in machine learning, unifying and extending existing methods.

Abstract: Normalization layers are crucial for deep learning, but their Euclidean
formulations are inadequate for data on manifolds. On the other hand, many
Riemannian manifolds in machine learning admit gyro-structures, enabling
principled extensions of Euclidean neural networks to non-Euclidean domains.
Inspired by this, we introduce GyroBN, a principled Riemannian batch
normalization framework for gyrogroups. We establish two necessary conditions,
namely \emph{pseudo-reduction} and \emph{gyroisometric gyrations}, that
guarantee GyroBN with theoretical control over sample statistics, and show that
these conditions hold for all known gyrogroups in machine learning. Our
framework also incorporates several existing Riemannian normalization methods
as special cases. We further instantiate GyroBN on seven representative
geometries, including the Grassmannian, five constant curvature spaces, and the
correlation manifold, and derive novel gyro and Riemannian structures to enable
these instantiations. Experiments across these geometries demonstrate the
effectiveness of GyroBN. The code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces TabGFM, a novel approach that converts graph data into tabular format to leverage the strengths of tabular foundation models (TFMs) for node classification and achieves superior results across various datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) struggle with generalizing to real-world datasets due to suboptimal training data, prompting a search for alternative approaches inspired by the success of tabular foundation models (TFMs).

Method: The authors reformulate node classification as a tabular problem, represent nodes as rows with feature, structure, and label information, and apply a framework (TabGFM) that uses structural encoders, table subsampling, multiple TFMs, and ensemble selection for prediction.

Result: TabGFM shows consistent improvements over traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and state-of-the-art GFMs in experiments conducted on 28 real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Tabular reformulation of graph data offers a promising and scalable path for advancing generalizable graph learning, outperforming current graph-specific models.

Abstract: Graph foundation models (GFMs) have recently emerged as a promising paradigm
for achieving broad generalization across various graph data. However, existing
GFMs are often trained on datasets that were shown to poorly represent
real-world graphs, limiting their generalization performance. In contrast,
tabular foundation models (TFMs) not only excel at classical tabular prediction
tasks but have also shown strong applicability in other domains such as time
series forecasting, natural language processing, and computer vision. Motivated
by this, we take an alternative view to the standard perspective of GFMs and
reformulate node classification as a tabular problem. Each node can be
represented as a row with feature, structure, and label information as columns,
enabling TFMs to directly perform zero-shot node classification via in-context
learning. In this work, we introduce TabGFM, a graph foundation model framework
that first converts a graph into a table via feature and structural encoders,
applies multiple TFMs to diversely subsampled tables, and then aggregates their
outputs through ensemble selection. Through experiments on 28 real-world
datasets, TabGFM achieves consistent improvements over task-specific GNNs and
state-of-the-art GFMs, highlighting the potential of tabular reformulation for
scalable and generalizable graph learning.

*Anatoly A. Krasnovsky*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Effective-Information Consistency Score (EICS), a method to quantify the trustworthiness and coherence of active Transformer Circuits in large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a formal, single-pass metric that evaluates the coherent and trustworthy behavior of active Transformer Circuits in large language models.

Method: The authors propose EICS, integrating a sheaf/cohomology framework with causal emergence principles. EICS computes normalized sheaf inconsistency from local Jacobians and activations alongside a Gaussian proxy for circuit-level causal emergence, yielding a dimensionless score.

Result: No empirical validation is provided yet, but the paper offers theoretical foundations, score interpretation guidance, and a toy sanity-check analysis for EICS.

Conclusion: EICS offers a white-box, single-pass approach to assess coherence in Transformer Circuits, merging systems-theoretic perspectives with practical computational considerations.

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability has identified functional subgraphs within large
language models (LLMs), known as Transformer Circuits (TCs), that appear to
implement specific algorithms. Yet we lack a formal, single-pass way to
quantify when an active circuit is behaving coherently and thus likely
trustworthy. Building on prior systems-theoretic proposals, we specialize a
sheaf/cohomology and causal emergence perspective to TCs and introduce the
Effective-Information Consistency Score (EICS). EICS combines (i) a normalized
sheaf inconsistency computed from local Jacobians and activations, with (ii) a
Gaussian EI proxy for circuit-level causal emergence derived from the same
forward state. The construction is white-box, single-pass, and makes units
explicit so that the score is dimensionless. We further provide practical
guidance on score interpretation, computational overhead (with fast and exact
modes), and a toy sanity-check analysis. Empirical validation on LLM tasks is
deferred.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The process of discovering new materials for technologies like solar cells and batteries is slow and expensive due to reliance on trial-and-error methods.

Method: The authors fine-tune the Qwen-2.5 7B model using Wyckoff-based text representation and apply Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) reinforcement learning to guide crystal generation.

Result: PLaID++ achieves ~50% more stable, unique crystal structures compared to previous methods and shows significant improvements in both unconditional and conditioned generation of space group properties.

Conclusion: The research successfully adapts and applies NLP post-training techniques to materials science, facilitating efficient and targeted discovery of novel materials.

Abstract: Discovering novel materials is critical for technological advancements such
as solar cells, batteries, and carbon capture. However, the development of new
materials is constrained by a slow and expensive trial-and-error process. To
accelerate this pipeline, we introduce PLaID++, a Large Language Model (LLM)
fine-tuned for stable and property-guided crystal generation. We fine-tune
Qwen-2.5 7B to generate crystal structures using a novel Wyckoff-based text
representation. We show that generation can be effectively guided with a
reinforcement learning technique based on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO),
with sampled structures categorized by their stability, novelty, and space
group. By encoding symmetry constraints directly into text and guiding model
outputs towards desirable chemical space, PLaID++ generates structures that are
thermodynamically stable, unique, and novel at a $\sim$50\% greater rate than
prior methods and conditionally generates structures with desired space group
properties. Our experiments highlight the effectiveness of iterative DPO,
achieving $\sim$115\% and $\sim$50\% improvements in unconditional and space
group conditioned generation, respectively, compared to fine-tuning alone. Our
work demonstrates the potential of adapting post-training techniques from
natural language processing to materials design, paving the way for targeted
and efficient discovery of novel materials.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The pharmaceutical industry faces challenges in predicting drug efficacy prior to clinical trials. This study aims to address the gap using machine learning to evaluate potential treatments earlier in the R&D process.

Method: A machine learning model is trained using pharmaceutical-pathway weight impact scores and patient data, analyzing weighted scores of untested drugs across molecular pathways to estimate efficacy.

Result: The approach is demonstrated using real-world patient treatment data and outcomes, employing two different scoring algorithms. Methods for generalization and predictive condition analysis are included.

Conclusion: This flexible framework provides a foundation for future research, exploiting real-world data and drug embeddings to improve untested drug efficacy predictions.

Abstract: In pharmaceutical R&D, predicting the efficacy of a pharmaceutical in
treating a particular disease prior to clinical testing or any real-world use
has been challenging. In this paper, we propose a flexible and modular machine
learning-based approach for predicting the efficacy of an untested
pharmaceutical for treating a disease. We train a machine learning model using
sets of pharmaceutical-pathway weight impact scores and patient data, which can
include patient characteristics and observed clinical outcomes. The resulting
model then analyses weighted impact scores of an untested pharmaceutical across
human biological molecule-protein pathways to generate a predicted efficacy
value. We demonstrate how the method works on a real-world dataset with patient
treatments and outcomes, with two different weight impact score algorithms We
include methods for evaluating the generalisation performance on unseen
treatments, and to characterise conditions under which the approach can be
expected to be most predictive. We discuss specific ways in which our approach
can be iterated on, making it an initial framework to support future work on
predicting the effect of untested drugs, leveraging RWD clinical data and drug
embeddings.

*Abhimanyu Bellam,Jung-Eun Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PTQ improves compression and speed but may worsen biases against minority groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantization methods often unintentionally heighten biases in neural networks, disproportionately affecting minority groups in predictions.

Method: Conducting an analysis on quantization’s effects on weights and activations, studying logits, loss, and group accuracies alongside optimization metrics like gradient norms and Hessian eigenvalues, then mitigating biases through a mix of mixed-precision QAT, dataset sampling, and weighted loss functions.

Result: Quantization impacts neural network fairness by decreasing variance in logits and increasing loss, which can compromise minority group accuracy.

Conclusion: Integrating fairness-focused tactics such as mixed-precision QAT and dataset techniques can counteract PTQ-induced impacts during deployment of quantized models.

Abstract: Post Training Quantization (PTQ) is widely adopted due to its high
compression capacity and speed with minimal impact on accuracy. However, we
observed that disparate impacts are exacerbated by quantization, especially for
minority groups. Our analysis explains that in the course of quantization there
is a chain of factors attributed to a disparate impact across groups during
forward and backward passes. We explore how the changes in weights and
activations induced by quantization cause cascaded impacts in the network,
resulting in logits with lower variance, increased loss, and compromised group
accuracies. We extend our study to verify the influence of these impacts on
group gradient norms and eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix, providing insights
into the state of the network from an optimization point of view. To mitigate
these effects, we propose integrating mixed precision Quantization Aware
Training (QAT) with dataset sampling methods and weighted loss functions,
therefore providing fair deployment of quantized neural networks.

significant performance boosts while maintaining solution correctness. Through
systematic parameter optimization across Qwen2.5-72B, Llama-3.1-70B,
DeepSeek-V3, Mixtral-8x22B, and Yi-Lightning, consistent efficiency gains are
demonstrated with 100% optimization success rate. The methodology achieves an
average 29.4% reduction in computational cost and 23.9% improvement in
inference speed across all tested models. This framework systematically
searches parameter spaces including temperature (0.1-0.5), reasoning steps
(4-12), planning periods (1-4), and nucleus sampling (0.85-0.98), determining
optimal configurations through testing on mathematical reasoning benchmarks.
Critical findings show that lower temperature regimes (0.1-0.4) and reduced
reasoning steps (4-6) consistently enhance efficiency without compromising
accuracy. DeepSeek-V3 achieves the highest accuracy at 98%, while Mixtral-8x22B
delivers the most cost-effective performance at 361.5 tokens per accurate
response. Key contributions include: (1) the first comprehensive optimization
study for five diverse SOTA models in mathematical reasoning, (2) a

discovery of universal optimization trends applicable across model
architectures, and (4) production-ready configurations with extensive
performance characterization.

TL;DR: The paper introduces IP-Basis PINNs, a meta-learning framework to solve inverse problems more efficiently by leveraging offline training to provide a basis and limiting online adaptation to lightweight adjustments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are computationally demanding for solving multi-query inverse problems due to costly retraining for each query.

Method: The approach introduces an offline-online decomposition: offline, a network generates basis functions for solution space, and online, solutions and parameters are inferred by training a lightweight output layer only.

Result: IP-Basis PINNs demonstrate consistent performance in diverse benchmarks, improved efficiency compared to standard PINNs, and robustness even with limited or noisy data.

Conclusion: The method significantly reduces computational overhead for inverse problems while maintaining high accuracy and adaptability, making it a practical alternative to conventional approaches.

Abstract: Solving inverse problems with Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) is
computationally expensive for multi-query scenarios, as each new set of
observed data requires a new, expensive training procedure. We present
Inverse-Parameter Basis PINNs (IP-Basis PINNs), a meta-learning framework that
extends the foundational work of Desai et al. (2022) to enable rapid and
efficient inference for inverse problems. Our method employs an offline-online
decomposition: a deep network is first trained offline to produce a rich set of
basis functions that span the solution space of a parametric differential
equation. For each new inverse problem online, this network is frozen, and
solutions and parameters are inferred by training only a lightweight linear
output layer against observed data. Key innovations that make our approach
effective for inverse problems include: (1) a novel online loss formulation for
simultaneous solution reconstruction and parameter identification, (2) a
significant reduction in computational overhead via forward-mode automatic
differentiation for PDE loss evaluation, and (3) a non-trivial validation and
early-stopping mechanism for robust offline training. We demonstrate the
efficacy of IP-Basis PINNs on three diverse benchmarks, including an extension
to universal PINNs for unknown functional terms-showing consistent performance
across constant and functional parameter estimation, a significant speedup per
query over standard PINNs, and robust operation with scarce and noisy data.

Motivation: Existing methods to handle gradient conflicts in MTL like PCGrad, CAGrad, and GradNorm are computationally expensive, restricting their use in large models and transformers.

Method: GCond combines PCGrad principles with gradient accumulation and an adaptive arbitration mechanism to more efficiently manage gradient conflicts.

Result: GCond showed superior performance across metrics, including lower L1 and SSIM losses, two-fold computational speedup, scalability to compact and large architectures, and compatibility with modern optimizers.

Conclusion: The proposed GCond method enhances scalability and efficiency in resolving gradient conflicts for MTL tasks, making it suitable for both compact and large-scale models.

Abstract: In multi-task learning (MTL), gradient conflict poses a significant
challenge. Effective methods for addressing this problem, including PCGrad,
CAGrad, and GradNorm, in their original implementations are computationally
demanding, which significantly limits their application in modern large models
and transformers. We propose Gradient Conductor (GCond), a method that builds
upon PCGrad principles by combining them with gradient accumulation and an
adaptive arbitration mechanism. We evaluated GCond on self-supervised learning
tasks using MobileNetV3-Small and ConvNeXt architectures on the ImageNet 1K
dataset and a combined head and neck CT scan dataset, comparing the proposed
method against baseline linear combinations and state-of-the-art gradient
conflict resolution methods. The stochastic mode of GCond achieved a two-fold
computational speedup while maintaining optimization quality, and demonstrated
superior performance across all evaluated metrics, achieving lower L1 and SSIM
losses compared to other methods on both datasets. GCond exhibited high
scalability, being successfully applied to both compact models
(MobileNetV3-Small) and large architectures (ConvNeXt-tiny and ConvNeXt-Base).
It also showed compatibility with modern optimizers such as AdamW and
Lion/LARS. Therefore, GCond offers a scalable and efficient solution to the
problem of gradient conflicts in multi-task learning.

### [189] [Learning Generalized Hamiltonian Dynamics with Stability from Noisy Trajectory Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07280)
*Luke McLennan,Yi Wang,Ryan Farell,Minh Nguyen,Chandrajit Bajaj*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework for learning generalized Hamiltonian dynamics from noisy and sparse data using variational Bayesian inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Hamiltonian models struggle to capture varying dynamics (conservative, dissipative, port-Hamiltonian) from sparse phase-space data.

Method: They extend sparse symplectic random Fourier Gaussian processes with numerical Hamiltonian estimation, focusing on a generalized dynamics approach and incorporating stability and conservation constraints.

Result: The addition of loss terms like stability and conservation constraints improves prediction accuracy and ensures physics correctness with reduced uncertainty.

Conclusion: The framework robustly learns Hamiltonian dynamics of varying classes with enhanced accuracy and reliability.

Abstract: We introduce a robust framework for learning various generalized Hamiltonian
dynamics from noisy, sparse phase-space data and in an unsupervised manner
based on variational Bayesian inference. Although conservative, dissipative,
and port-Hamiltonian systems might share the same initial total energy of a
closed system, it is challenging for a single Hamiltonian network model to
capture the distinctive and varying motion dynamics and physics of a phase
space, from sampled observational phase space trajectories. To address this
complicated Hamiltonian manifold learning challenge, we extend sparse
symplectic, random Fourier Gaussian processes learning with predictive
successive numerical estimations of the Hamiltonian landscape, using a
generalized form of state and conjugate momentum Hamiltonian dynamics,
appropriate to different classes of conservative, dissipative and
port-Hamiltonian physical systems. In addition to the kernelized evidence lower
bound (ELBO) loss for data fidelity, we incorporate stability and conservation
constraints as additional hyper-parameter balanced loss terms to regularize the
model's multi-gradients, enforcing physics correctness for improved prediction
accuracy with bounded uncertainty.

### [190] [ALICE: An Interpretable Neural Architecture for Generalization in Substitution Ciphers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07282)
*Jeff Shen,Lindsay Smith*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces ALICE, a Transformer-based model for solving substitution cipher cryptograms, achieving state-of-the-art performance and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to explore neural network generalization abilities in combinatorially complex domains using cryptogram solving as the experimental framework.

Method: The authors designed ALICE, a simple encoder-only Transformer with a novel bijective decoding mechanism based on the Gumbel-Sinkhorn method for better interpretability.

Result: ALICE successfully generalizes to unseen ciphers after training on a small sample (∼1500 ciphers) of possible cipher mappings and demonstrates progressive human-like strategies for deciphering text.

Conclusion: The architectural approaches in ALICE enhance neural network efficacy and interpretability, with potential applications in other domains featuring bijective mappings and combinatorial challenges.

Abstract: We present cryptogram solving as an ideal testbed for studying neural network
generalization in combinatorially complex domains. In this task, models must
decrypt text encoded with substitution ciphers, choosing from 26! possible
mappings without explicit access to the cipher. We develop ALICE (an
Architecture for Learning Interpretable Cryptogram dEcipherment): a simple
encoder-only Transformer that sets a new state-of-the-art for both accuracy and
speed on this decryption problem. Surprisingly, ALICE generalizes to unseen
ciphers after training on only ${\sim}1500$ unique ciphers, a minute fraction
($3.7 \times 10^{-24}$) of the possible cipher space. To enhance
interpretability, we introduce a novel bijective decoding head that explicitly
models permutations via the Gumbel-Sinkhorn method, enabling direct extraction
of learned cipher mappings. Through early exit analysis, we reveal how ALICE
progressively refines its predictions in a way that appears to mirror common
human strategies for this task: early layers employ frequency-based heuristics,
middle layers form word structures, and final layers correct individual
characters. Our architectural innovations and analysis methods extend beyond
cryptograms to any domain with bijective mappings and combinatorial structure,
offering new insights into neural network generalization and interpretability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a system using large language models (LLMs) to automate guideline-concordant treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) based on NCCN guidelines, with a focus on reducing human error and time, enhancing accuracy, and enabling regulatory compliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Translating complex patient cases into guideline-compliant cancer treatments is time-intensive, prone to errors, and requires specialized expertise, which leads to inefficiencies in clinical workflows.

Method: The authors create a dataset of NSCLC patient trajectories annotated by oncologists, demonstrate LLMs' ability to generate guideline-proxy benchmarks, and develop a hybrid framework combining human annotations with model consistency checks for clinical accuracy and confidence scores.

Result: They achieve strong correlations between LLM outputs and expert-annotated benchmarks, a meta-classifier with AUROC=0.800, and a system capable of generating accurate, trusted treatment recommendations.

Conclusion: The study establishes a scalable and clinically viable approach for automated decision support in cancer treatment using LLMs, balancing accuracy, interpretability, and regulatory needs while reducing manual annotation costs.

Abstract: The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) provides evidence-based
guidelines for cancer treatment. Translating complex patient presentations into
guideline-compliant treatment recommendations is time-intensive, requires
specialized expertise, and is prone to error. Advances in large language model
(LLM) capabilities promise to reduce the time required to generate treatment
recommendations and improve accuracy. We present an LLM agent-based approach to
automatically generate guideline-concordant treatment trajectories for patients
with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Our contributions are threefold.
First, we construct a novel longitudinal dataset of 121 cases of NSCLC patients
that includes clinical encounters, diagnostic results, and medical histories,
each expertly annotated with the corresponding NCCN guideline trajectories by
board-certified oncologists. Second, we demonstrate that existing LLMs possess
domain-specific knowledge that enables high-quality proxy benchmark generation
for both model development and evaluation, achieving strong correlation
(Spearman coefficient r=0.88, RMSE = 0.08) with expert-annotated benchmarks.
Third, we develop a hybrid approach combining expensive human annotations with
model consistency information to create both the agent framework that predicts
the relevant guidelines for a patient, as well as a meta-classifier that
verifies prediction accuracy with calibrated confidence scores for treatment
recommendations (AUROC=0.800), a critical capability for communicating the
accuracy of outputs, custom-tailoring tradeoffs in performance, and supporting
regulatory compliance. This work establishes a framework for clinically viable
LLM-based guideline adherence systems that balance accuracy, interpretability,
and regulatory requirements while reducing annotation costs, providing a
scalable pathway toward automated clinical decision support.

### [192] [General Demographic Foundation Models for Enhancing Predictive Performance Across Diseases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07330)
*Li-Chin Chen,Ji-Tian Sheu,Yuh-Jue Chuang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduces a General Demographic Pre-trained (GDP) model to improve the representation of age and gender in electronic health record-based predictive models, enhancing their predictive performance across various tasks and populations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Demographic attributes like age and gender are crucial in clinical modeling but are often underutilized in traditional designs, necessitating improved representation methods.

Method: The GDP model uses pre-training with datasets containing diverse diseases and populations. The architecture employs ordering strategies and encoding methods to transform demographic inputs into latent embeddings for use in gradient boosting models.

Result: Sequential ordering strategies in GDP significantly enhanced model performance, especially in discrimination, calibration, and decision tree splits, even for diseases that heavily rely on age and gender or in datasets where demographics play a smaller role.

Conclusion: The GDP framework generalizes well across tasks and populations, suggesting its potential to improve predictive healthcare models by enhancing the role of demographic attributes.

Abstract: Demographic attributes are universally present in electronic health records
and serve as vital predictors in clinical risk stratification and treatment
decisions. Despite their significance, these attributes are often relegated to
auxiliary roles in model design, with limited attention has been given to
learning their representations. This study proposes a General Demographic
Pre-trained (GDP) model as a foundational representation framework tailored to
age and gender. The model is pre-trained and evaluated using datasets with
diverse diseases and population compositions from different geographic regions.
The GDP architecture explores combinations of ordering strategies and encoding
methods to transform tabular demographic inputs into latent embeddings.
Experimental results demonstrate that sequential ordering substantially
improves model performance in discrimination, calibration, and the
corresponding information gain at each decision tree split, particularly in
diseases where age and gender contribute significantly to risk stratification.
Even in datasets where demographic attributes hold relatively low predictive
value, GDP enhances the representational importance, increasing their influence
in downstream gradient boosting models. The findings suggest that foundational
models for tabular demographic attributes can generalize across tasks and
populations, offering a promising direction for improving predictive
performance in healthcare applications.

*Qihu Xie,Yuan Li,Yi Kang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes SBS, a technique to efficiently compress neural network parameters while reducing spectral bias, achieving improved reconstruction accuracy with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance parameter compression in neural representation for neural networks by addressing the spectral bias issue that limits high-frequency reconstruction.

Method: The authors introduce SBS, leveraging (1) a unidirectional ordering-based smoothing for better kernel smoothness and (2) adaptive random Fourier features to modulate frequency bandwidth based on layer-wise parameters.

Result: SBS significantly outperforms existing methods in reconstruction accuracy with less parameters on ResNet models using datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet.

Conclusion: SBS suppresses spectral bias effectively, offering parameter-efficient compression and improved performance in neural representation for neural networks.

Abstract: Implicit neural representations have recently been extended to represent
convolutional neural network weights via neural representation for neural
networks, offering promising parameter compression benefits. However, standard
multi-layer perceptrons used in neural representation for neural networks
exhibit a pronounced spectral bias, hampering their ability to reconstruct
high-frequency details effectively. In this paper, we propose SBS, a
parameter-efficient enhancement to neural representation for neural networks
that suppresses spectral bias using two techniques: (1) a unidirectional
ordering-based smoothing that improves kernel smoothness in the output space,
and (2) unidirectional ordering-based smoothing aware random fourier features
that adaptively modulate the frequency bandwidth of input encodings based on
layer-wise parameter count. Extensive evaluations on various ResNet models with
datasets CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, demonstrate that SBS achieves
significantly better reconstruction accuracy with less parameters compared to
SOTA.

Motivation: Cardiac arrest is a major global health concern, and early detection is critical for improving patient outcomes.

Method: The framework integrates compound scaling and EfficientNet for cardiovascular image feature extraction, paired with a digital twin model generated from IoT data to create individualized simulations.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that the system provides accurate and efficient predictions of cardiac arrest.

Conclusion: Combining deep learning with digital twin technology allows for a personalized and advanced approach to predicting cardiac issues, potentially enhancing proactive medical interventions.

Abstract: Cardiac arrest is one of the biggest global health problems, and early
identification and management are key to enhancing the patient's prognosis. In
this paper, we propose a novel framework that combines an EfficientNet-based
deep learning model with a digital twin system to improve the early detection
and analysis of cardiac arrest. We use compound scaling and EfficientNet to
learn the features of cardiovascular images. In parallel, the digital twin
creates a realistic and individualized cardiovascular system model of the
patient based on data received from the Internet of Things (IoT) devices
attached to the patient, which can help in the constant assessment of the
patient and the impact of possible treatment plans. As shown by our
experiments, the proposed system is highly accurate in its prediction abilities
and, at the same time, efficient. Combining highly advanced techniques such as
deep learning and digital twin (DT) technology presents the possibility of
using an active and individual approach to predicting cardiac disease.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces EMORF-II, a learning-based filter for handling correlated noise and outliers, showing improved accuracy compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in filtering measurement noise in scenarios with correlated noise and outliers, and improve robustness in outlier mitigation.

Method: Enhancement of EMORF by incorporating a learning mechanism during inference to detect and mitigate outliers more effectively.

Result: Numerical experiments demonstrate improved accuracy with slightly increased computational overhead but maintaining practical computational complexity.

Conclusion: EMORF-II proves to be an effective choice in handling measurement noise and outliers across various applications due to its enhanced capabilities and practical complexity.

Abstract: We present a learning-based outlier-robust filter for a general setup where
the measurement noise can be correlated. Since it is an enhanced version of
EM-based outlier robust filter (EMORF), we call it as EMORF-II. As it is
equipped with an additional powerful feature to learn the outlier
characteristics during inference along with outlier-detection, EMORF-II has
improved outlier-mitigation capability. Numerical experiments confirm
performance gains as compared to the state-of-the-art methods in terms of
accuracy with an increased computational overhead. However, thankfully the
computational complexity order remains at par with other practical methods
making it a useful choice for diverse applications.

*Long Li,Jiaran Hao,Jason Klein Liu,Zhijian Zhou,Xiaoyu Tan,Wei Chu,Zhe Wang,Shirui Pan,Chao Qu,Yuan Qi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Diversity-Preserving Hybrid RL (DPH-RL), a framework to mitigate knowledge retention issues in fine-tuning Large Language Models using Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR fine-tuning methods for LLMs often improve single-attempt accuracy but degrade multi-attempt performance (Pass@k) and suffer from catastrophic forgetting. Current approaches lack mechanisms to retain knowledge and diverse solutions effectively.

Method: The proposed DPH-RL framework leverages mass-covering f-divergences (like forward-KL and JS-divergence) to act as rehearsal mechanisms. It references the initial policy to maintain diverse knowledge during fine-tuning, eliminating the need for an online reference model.

Result: DPH-RL demonstrated improved single-attempt (Pass@1) and multi-attempt (Pass@k) performance in in-domain and out-of-domain tests for math and SQL generation tasks. It also showed training efficiency improvements by using generator functions for f-divergence computation.

Conclusion: DPH-RL resolves the common degradation of multi-attempt performance in RLVR and highlights the importance of selecting appropriate divergence measures. This approach builds more general and diverse reasoning models while optimizing training efficiency.

Abstract: A central paradox in fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) is the frequent
degradation of multi-attempt performance (Pass@k) despite improvements in
single-attempt accuracy (Pass@1). This is often accompanied by catastrophic
forgetting, where models lose previously acquired skills. While various methods
have been proposed, the choice and function of the divergence term have been
surprisingly unexamined as a proactive solution. We argue that standard RLVR
objectives -- both those using the mode-seeking reverse KL-divergence and those
forgoing a divergence term entirely -- lack a crucial mechanism for knowledge
retention. The reverse-KL actively accelerates this decay by narrowing the
policy, while its absence provides no safeguard against the model drifting from
its diverse knowledge base. We propose a fundamental shift in perspective:
using the divergence term itself as the solution. Our framework,
Diversity-Preserving Hybrid RL (DPH-RL), leverages mass-covering f-divergences
(like forward-KL and JS-divergence) to function as a rehearsal mechanism. By
continuously referencing the initial policy, this approach forces the model to
maintain broad solution coverage. Extensive experiments on math and SQL
generation demonstrate that DPH-RL not only resolves the Pass@k degradation but
improves both Pass@1 and Pass@k in- and out-of-domain. Additionally, DPH-RL is
more training-efficient because it computes f-divergence using generator
functions, requiring only sampling from the initial policy and no online
reference model. Our work highlights a crucial, overlooked axis for improving
RLVR, demonstrating that the proper selection of a divergence measure is a
powerful tool for building more general and diverse reasoning models.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a convolutional AutoEncoder architecture for improved user modelling and recommendation tasks, capable of learning from explicit and implicit feedback, providing informative predictions, and achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for improved recommender systems that can learn associations, consider different feedback types, and provide more meaningful predictions.

Method: The authors developed a convolutional AutoEncoder that learns jointly from explicit ratings and implicit feedback, predicts content consumption probabilities and ratings likelihoods, and provides generalization bounds for improved reliability.

Result: The model outperformed existing methods on real-life datasets, delivering state-of-the-art results for both implicit and explicit feedback prediction tasks with enhanced interpretability.

Conclusion: The proposed model is effective for recommendation system tasks, offering flexibility, informative predictions, and robust generalization bounds alongside state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: We introduce a new convolutional AutoEncoder architecture for user modelling
and recommendation tasks with several improvements over the state of the art.
Firstly, our model has the flexibility to learn a set of associations and
combinations between different interaction types in a way that carries over to
each user and item. Secondly, our model is able to learn jointly from both the
explicit ratings and the implicit information in the sampling pattern (which we
refer to as `implicit feedback'). It can also make separate predictions for the
probability of consuming content and the likelihood of granting it a high
rating if observed. This not only allows the model to make predictions for both
the implicit and explicit feedback, but also increases the informativeness of
the predictions: in particular, our model can identify items which users would
not have been likely to consume naturally, but would be likely to enjoy if
exposed to them. Finally, we provide several generalization bounds for our
model, which to the best of our knowledge, are among the first generalization
bounds for auto-encoders in a Recommender Systems setting; we also show that
optimizing our loss function guarantees the recovery of the exact sampling
distribution over interactions up to a small error in total variation. In
experiments on several real-life datasets, we achieve state-of-the-art
performance on both the implicit and explicit feedback prediction tasks despite
relying on a single model for both, and benefiting from additional
interpretability in the form of individual predictions for the probabilities of
each possible rating.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel method for short-term water demand forecasting using unsupervised contrastive learning and wavelet-transformed convolutional networks with cross-attention, achieving improved performance in real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the urgent need for better forecasting of water demand due to increasing uncertainties caused by climate change and socioeconomic factors.

Method: The paper utilizes unsupervised contrastive learning to categorize end-users based on consumption behavior and employs wavelet-transformed convolutional networks with cross-attention for improved forecasting.

Result: The approach demonstrated enhanced forecasting performance, showing up to 4.9% improvement in MAPE, and identified consumption behaviors influenced by socioeconomic factors.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology not only improves water demand prediction but also offers insights into the socioeconomic-driven behavior patterns affecting consumption.

Abstract: Advancements in smart metering technologies have significantly improved the
ability to monitor and manage water utilities. In the context of increasing
uncertainty due to climate change, securing water resources and supply has
emerged as an urgent global issue with extensive socioeconomic ramifications.
Hourly consumption data from end-users have yielded substantial insights for
projecting demand across regions characterized by diverse consumption patterns.
Nevertheless, the prediction of water demand remains challenging due to
influencing non-deterministic factors, such as meteorological conditions. This
work introduces a novel method for short-term water demand forecasting for
District Metered Areas (DMAs) which encompass commercial, agricultural, and
residential consumers. Unsupervised contrastive learning is applied to
categorize end-users according to distinct consumption behaviors present within
a DMA. Subsequently, the distinct consumption behaviors are utilized as
features in the ensuing demand forecasting task using wavelet-transformed
convolutional networks that incorporate a cross-attention mechanism combining
both historical data and the derived representations. The proposed approach is
evaluated on real-world DMAs over a six-month period, demonstrating improved
forecasting performance in terms of MAPE across different DMAs, with a maximum
improvement of 4.9%. Additionally, it identifies consumers whose behavior is
shaped by socioeconomic factors, enhancing prior knowledge about the
deterministic patterns that influence demand.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RoseCDL, a robust algorithm for unsupervised rare event detection in large signals, addressing computational and artifact sensitivity issues in Convolutional Dictionary Learning (CDL).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to detect recurring patterns and rare events efficiently in large-scale signals across domains like astronomy and biomedical science, coupled with the lack of exploration of CDL's capability for rare event detection.

Method: The method involves developing RoseCDL, which integrates stochastic windowing for scalable training and inline outlier detection for robust anomaly isolation.

Result: The proposed RoseCDL algorithm significantly improves CDL's capacity to detect rare events in signals, making it scalable and resistant to artifacts and outliers.

Conclusion: RoseCDL provides a practical extension to CDL's usage, enabling efficient rare event detection and characterization in real-world signal applications.

Abstract: Identifying recurring patterns and rare events in large-scale signals is a
fundamental challenge in fields such as astronomy, physical simulations, and
biomedical science. Convolutional Dictionary Learning (CDL) offers a powerful
framework for modeling local structures in signals, but its use for detecting
rare or anomalous events remains largely unexplored. In particular, CDL faces
two key challenges in this setting: high computational cost and sensitivity to
artifacts and outliers. In this paper, we introduce RoseCDL, a scalable and
robust CDL algorithm designed for unsupervised rare event detection in long
signals. RoseCDL combines stochastic windowing for efficient training on large
datasets with inline outlier detection to enhance robustness and isolate
anomalous patterns. This reframes CDL as a practical tool for event discovery
and characterization in real-world signals, extending its role beyond
traditional tasks like compression or denoising.

TL;DR: This paper introduces $
abla L$ Normalization, a method to enhance loss aggregation in RLVR for LLMs by minimizing gradient variance and achieving stable optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the optimization instability due to varying response lengths during RLVR training in large language models.

Method: Theoretically and empirically reformulate the policy loss problem to find a minimum-variance unbiased estimator and introduce $
abla L$ Normalization as the solution.

Result: Extensive experiments validate that $
abla L$ Normalization consistently improves performance across LLM model sizes, task variations, and length ranges.

Conclusion: $
abla L$ Normalization achieves unbiased policy loss estimation and minimizes gradient variance, making optimization more stable and efficient.

Abstract: We propose $\Delta L$ Normalization, a simple yet effective loss aggregation
method tailored to the characteristic of dynamic generation lengths in
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). Recently, RLVR has
demonstrated strong potential in improving the reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs), but a major challenge lies in the large variability of
response lengths during training, which leads to high gradient variance and
unstable optimization. Although previous methods such as GRPO, DAPO, and Dr.
GRPO introduce different loss normalization terms to address this issue, they
either produce biased estimates or still suffer from high gradient variance. By
analyzing the effect of varying lengths on policy loss both theoretically and
empirically, we reformulate the problem as finding a minimum-variance unbiased
estimator. Our proposed $\Delta L$ Normalization not only provides an unbiased
estimate of the true policy loss but also minimizes gradient variance in
theory. Extensive experiments show that it consistently achieves superior
results across different model sizes, maximum lengths, and tasks. Our code will
be made public at https://github.com/zerolllin/Delta-L-Normalization.

TL;DR: This study introduces a dual formulation for Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to address challenges in modeling materials with discontinuous coefficients. It enhances PINN reliability and improves detection of failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PINNs struggle with materials having discontinuous coefficients, especially in multiscale modeling applications such as homogenization of periodic thermo-conductive composites.

Method: The paper proposes a dual formulation for both strong and variational PINNs, evaluates these methods, and integrates error bounds using spectral and neural network-based test functions.

Result: While strong-form PINNs perform better in controlled environments, they fail with material discontinuities. Variational PINNs handle discontinuities better but need careful test function selection to avoid instability. Dual formulation effectively diagnoses convergence quality.

Conclusion: The dual formulation strengthens PINNs’ applicability to homogenization problems in micromechanics by offering improved diagnostics and reliability in handling discontinuous materials.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have shown promise in solving
partial differential equations (PDEs) relevant to multiscale modeling, but they
often fail when applied to materials with discontinuous coefficients, such as
media with piecewise constant properties. This paper introduces a dual
formulation for the PINN framework to improve the reliability of the
homogenization of periodic thermo-conductive composites, for both strong and
variational (weak) formulations. The dual approach facilitates the derivation
of guaranteed upper and lower error bounds, enabling more robust detection of
PINN failure. We compare standard PINNs applied to smoothed material
approximations with variational PINNs (VPINNs) using both spectral and neural
network-based test functions. Our results indicate that while strong-form PINNs
may outperform VPINNs in controlled settings, they are sensitive to material
discontinuities and may fail without clear diagnostics. In contrast, VPINNs
accommodate piecewise constant material parameters directly but require careful
selection of test functions to avoid instability. Dual formulation serves as a
reliable indicator of convergence quality, and its integration into PINN
frameworks enhances their applicability to homogenization problems in
micromechanics.

Attention mechanisms are employed to enhance performance and identify key sensor locations.

Result: The model achieves a classification accuracy of 99.83% and a crack detection recall of 99.73%. Robustness is confirmed through 3 repetitions of 10-fold stratified cross-validation.

Conclusion: Attention-based deep learning provides actionable insights for sensor placement optimization, enabling proactive maintenance and improving operational reliability in semiconductor industry applications.

Abstract: This paper presents an innovative Transformer-based deep learning strategy
for optimizing the placement of sensors aiming at structural health monitoring
of semiconductor probe cards. Failures in probe cards, including substrate
cracks and loosened screws, would critically affect semiconductor manufacturing
yield and reliability. Some failure modes could be detected by equipping a
probe card with adequate sensors. Frequency response functions from simulated
failure scenarios are adopted within a finite element model of a probe card. A
comprehensive dataset, enriched by physics-informed scenario expansion and
physics-aware statistical data augmentation, is exploited to train a hybrid
Convolutional Neural Network and Transformer model. The model achieves high
accuracy (99.83%) in classifying the probe card health states (baseline, loose
screw, crack) and an excellent crack detection recall (99.73%). Model
robustness is confirmed through a rigorous framework of 3 repetitions of
10-fold stratified cross-validation. The attention mechanism also pinpoints
critical sensor locations: an analysis of the attention weights offers
actionable insights for designing efficient, cost-effective monitoring systems
by optimizing sensor configurations. This research highlights the capability of
attention-based deep learning to advance proactive maintenance, enhancing
operational reliability and yield in semiconductor manufacturing.

### [205] [Beyond Rebalancing: Benchmarking Binary Classifiers Under Class Imbalance Without Rebalancing Techniques](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07605)
*Ali Nawaz,Amir Ahmad,Shehroz S. Khan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the performance of binary classifiers under severe class imbalance without using explicit rebalancing methods. Advanced models like TabPFN and boosting-based ensembles perform better than traditional classifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Class imbalance is a significant challenge in supervised classification, especially in fields like medical diagnosis and anomaly detection, but little focus has been placed on evaluating classifier performance without applying rebalancing techniques.

Method: The study systematically tests binary classifiers on real-world and synthetic datasets with progressively reduced minority class sizes, employing one-shot and few-shot scenarios as baselines. It also includes experiments using undersampling, oversampling, and one-class classification approaches.

Result: As data complexity increases and minority class size decreases, classifier performance declines. While traditional classifiers struggle under extreme imbalance, advanced models like TabPFN and boosting-based ensembles demonstrate comparatively better performance and generalization.

Conclusion: The research highlights the robustness of advanced classification models in imbalanced learning scenarios and provides guidance for model selection without relying on explicit rebalancing strategies.

Abstract: Class imbalance poses a significant challenge to supervised classification,
particularly in critical domains like medical diagnostics and anomaly detection
where minority class instances are rare. While numerous studies have explored
rebalancing techniques to address this issue, less attention has been given to
evaluating the performance of binary classifiers under imbalance when no such
techniques are applied. Therefore, the goal of this study is to assess the
performance of binary classifiers "as-is", without performing any explicit
rebalancing. Specifically, we systematically evaluate the robustness of a
diverse set of binary classifiers across both real-world and synthetic
datasets, under progressively reduced minority class sizes, using one-shot and
few-shot scenarios as baselines. Our approach also explores varying data
complexities through synthetic decision boundary generation to simulate
real-world conditions. In addition to standard classifiers, we include
experiments using undersampling, oversampling strategies, and one-class
classification (OCC) methods to examine their behavior under severe imbalance.
The results confirm that classification becomes more difficult as data
complexity increases and the minority class size decreases. While traditional
classifiers deteriorate under extreme imbalance, advanced models like TabPFN
and boosting-based ensembles retain relatively higher performance and better
generalization compared to traditional classifiers. Visual interpretability and
evaluation metrics further validate these findings. Our work offers valuable
guidance on model selection for imbalanced learning, providing insights into
classifier robustness without dependence on explicit rebalancing techniques.

*Lachlan Simpson,Kyle Millar,Adriel Cheng,Cheng-Chew Lim,Hong Gunn Chew*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper extends the Integrated Gradients (IG) explainability technique to graphs, introducing Graph-Based Integrated Gradients (GB-IG), and demonstrates its effectiveness on both synthetic and real-world graph datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Integrated Gradients (IG) struggles with explaining graph-based neural networks because graphs are discrete structures, unlike the continuous data assumed by IG.

Method: The authors propose Graph-Based Integrated Gradients (GB-IG), an adapted version of IG tailored specifically for graph-based classification tasks, and evaluate it on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Result: GB-IG successfully identifies key structural features in synthetic graphs and outperforms standard IG in emphasizing relevant features for node classification on real-world graph data.

Conclusion: GB-IG is a more suitable explainability technique for graph neural networks, showing enhanced performance compared to traditional Integrated Gradients.

Abstract: Integrated Gradients (IG) is a common explainability technique to address the
black-box problem of neural networks. Integrated gradients assumes continuous
data. Graphs are discrete structures making IG ill-suited to graphs. In this
work, we introduce graph-based integrated gradients (GB-IG); an extension of IG
to graphs. We demonstrate on four synthetic datasets that GB-IG accurately
identifies crucial structural components of the graph used in classification
tasks. We further demonstrate on three prevalent real-world graph datasets that
GB-IG outperforms IG in highlighting important features for node classification
tasks.

*Pierre Lambert,Edouard Couplet,Michel Verleysen,John Aldo Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method to accelerate Neighbour Embeddings for visualizing high-dimensional datasets, striking a balance between speed and quality without limiting dimensionality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accelerated Neighbour Embeddings methods often compromise between speed and structure quality or are limited to visualization in 2-3 dimensions. The motivation is to bridge this gap and improve both speed and quality while allowing more dimensional flexibility.

Method: The proposed method optimizes Neighbour Embeddings by introducing a new iterative approximate nearest neighbour search, enabling real-time visual feedback, hyperparameter control, and broader dimensions without a two-phased approach.

Result: Experiments using GPU-accelerated GUI integration demonstrate promising results in terms of speed, extracted structure quality, and usability for wider machine learning tasks with minimal adjustments.

Conclusion: The method successfully balances computational efficiency, structure preservation, flexibility, and broader applicability beyond visualization-focused Neighbour Embeddings.

Abstract: Neighbour embeddings (NE) allow the representation of high dimensional
datasets into lower dimensional spaces and are often used in data
visualisation. In practice, accelerated approximations are employed to handle
very large datasets. Accelerating NE is challenging, and two main directions
have been explored: very coarse approximations based on negative sampling (as
in UMAP) achieve high effective speed but may lack quality in the extracted
structures; less coarse approximations, as used in FIt-SNE or BH-t-SNE, offer
better structure preservation at the cost of speed, while also restricting the
target dimensionality to 2 or 3, limiting NE to visualisation. In some
variants, the precision of these costlier accelerations also enables
finer-grained control on the extracted structures through dedicated
hyperparameters.
  This paper proposes to bridge the gab between both approaches by introducing
a novel way to accelerate NE, requiring a small number of computations per
iteration while maintaining good fine-grained structure preservation and
flexibility through hyperparameter tuning, without limiting the dimensionality
of the embedding space. The method was designed for interactive exploration of
data; as such, it abandons the traditional two-phased approach of other NE
methods, allowing instantaneous visual feedback when changing hyperparameters,
even when these control processes happening on the high-dimensional side of the
computations. Experiments using a publicly available, GPU accelerated GUI
integration of the method show promising results in terms of speed, flexibility
in the structures getting extracted, and show potential uses in broader machine
learning contexts with minimal algorithmic modifications. Central to this
algorithm is a novel approach to iterative approximate nearest neighbour
search, which shows promising results compared to nearest neighbour descent.

*Shusen Ma,Tianhao Zhang,Qijiu Xia,Yun-Bo Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes the Interpretable Bidirectional-modeling Network (IBN), which improves multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) with missing data using uncertainty-aware interpolation and enhanced temporal modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multivariate time series forecasting is hindered by missing variables, leading to challenges for conventional spatial-temporal graph neural networks in capturing inter-variable correlations.

Method: IBN employs Uncertainty-Aware Interpolation (UAI) using MC Dropout for mitigating high-risk reconstructions and Gaussian kernel-based Graph Convolution (GGCN) for spatial correlations. It also introduces a bidirectional recursive unit to enhance temporal dependency modeling.

Result: The proposed IBN demonstrates state-of-the-art forecasting performances across various missing-rate scenarios, showing reliability and interpretability.

Conclusion: The IBN framework offers a robust and interpretable approach to MTSF with missing variables, addressing the limitations of prior models like GinAR.

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) often faces challenges from
missing variables, which hinder conventional spatial-temporal graph neural
networks in modeling inter-variable correlations. While GinAR addresses
variable missing using attention-based imputation and adaptive graph learning
for the first time, it lacks interpretability and fails to capture more latent
temporal patterns due to its simple recursive units (RUs). To overcome these
limitations, we propose the Interpretable Bidirectional-modeling Network (IBN),
integrating Uncertainty-Aware Interpolation (UAI) and Gaussian kernel-based
Graph Convolution (GGCN). IBN estimates the uncertainty of reconstructed values
using MC Dropout and applies an uncertainty-weighted strategy to mitigate
high-risk reconstructions. GGCN explicitly models spatial correlations among
variables, while a bidirectional RU enhances temporal dependency modeling.
Extensive experiments show that IBN achieves state-of-the-art forecasting
performance under various missing-rate scenarios, providing a more reliable and
interpretable framework for MTSF with missing variables. Code is available at:

Motivation: To understand and predict patterns of equipment attrition in the context of the war in Ukraine.

Method: Used a combination of statistical and deep learning models to analyze OSINT data, comparing their performance for forecasting Russian equipment losses.

Result: Deep learning models like LSTM and TCN provided stable and consistent forecasts, especially for granular temporal data.

Conclusion: Ensemble forecasting and open-source intelligence data are valuable tools for analyzing and predicting conflict-related material losses.

*Mohammad Zana Majidi,Sajjad Karimi,Teng Wang,Robert Kluger,Reginald Souleyrette*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study integrates unstructured crash narratives with structured data to improve traffic injury severity predictions using NLP techniques and machine learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving road safety by accurately predicting injury severity in traffic crashes through advanced modeling techniques.

Method: The researchers combined structured crash data and unstructured police narratives, using NLP methods like TF-IDF and Word2Vec, processed with ensemble algorithms and oversampling to predict injury severity.

Result: Models using narrative data outperformed those using structured data alone; TF-IDF paired with XGBoost showed the highest accuracy across subgroups.

Conclusion: Integrating textual narratives with structured crash data enhances injury prediction, offering valuable insights to transportation safety frameworks and policy-making.

Abstract: Predicting injuries and fatalities in traffic crashes plays a critical role
in enhancing road safety, improving emergency response, and guiding public
health interventions. This study investigates the added value of unstructured
crash narratives (written by police officers at the scene) when combined with
structured crash data to predict injury severity. Two widely used Natural
Language Processing (NLP) techniques, Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency
(TF-IDF) and Word2Vec, were employed to extract semantic meaning from the
narratives, and their effectiveness was compared. To address the challenge of
class imbalance, a K-Nearest Neighbors-based oversampling method was applied to
the training data prior to modeling. The dataset consists of crash records from
Kentucky spanning 2019 to 2023. To account for roadway heterogeneity, three
road classification schemes were used: (1) eight detailed functional classes
(e.g., Urban Two-Lane, Rural Interstate, Urban Multilane Divided), (2) four
broader paired categories (e.g., Urban vs. Rural, Freeway vs. Non-Freeway), and
(3) a unified dataset without classification. A total of 102 machine learning
models were developed by combining structured features and narrative-based
features using the two NLP techniques alongside three ensemble algorithms:
XGBoost, Random Forest, and AdaBoost. Results demonstrate that models
incorporating narrative data consistently outperform those relying solely on
structured data. Among all combinations, TF-IDF coupled with XGBoost yielded
the most accurate predictions in most subgroups. The findings highlight the
power of integrating textual and structured crash information to enhance
person-level injury prediction. This work offers a practical and adaptable
framework for transportation safety professionals to improve crash severity
modeling, guide policy decisions, and design more effective countermeasures.

*Antoine de Mathelin,Christopher Tosh,Wesley Tansey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the cold-start problem in personalized oncology drug screening by proposing a pretrained deep learning model to prioritize and optimally select early experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developments in patient-derived models have enabled ex vivo high-throughput screening for combination therapies, but exhaustive experimentation remains infeasible due to limited feasible experiments and lack of molecular profiling information.

Method: The study leverages a pretrained deep learning model using historical drug response data to generate drug embeddings and dose-level importance scores, integrating clustering and dose-weighting mechanisms to optimize initial drug combination experiments.

Result: Retrospective simulations on large-scale drug datasets showed the proposed method improved early screening efficiency compared to baseline approaches.

Conclusion: By improving early-phase decision-making in experimental settings, the method offers a viable strategy for personalized combination therapy, addressing limitations of cold-start drug screening models.

Abstract: Personalizing combination therapies in oncology requires navigating an
immense space of possible drug and dose combinations, a task that remains
largely infeasible through exhaustive experimentation. Recent developments in
patient-derived models have enabled high-throughput ex vivo screening, but the
number of feasible experiments is limited. Further, a tight therapeutic window
makes gathering molecular profiling information (e.g. RNA-seq) impractical as a
means of guiding drug response prediction. This leads to a challenging
cold-start problem: how do we select the most informative combinations to test
early, when no prior information about the patient is available? We propose a
strategy that leverages a pretrained deep learning model built on historical
drug response data. The model provides both embeddings for drug combinations
and dose-level importance scores, enabling a principled selection of initial
experiments. We combine clustering of drug embeddings to ensure functional
diversity with a dose-weighting mechanism that prioritizes doses based on their
historical informativeness. Retrospective simulations on large-scale drug
combination datasets show that our method substantially improves initial
screening efficiency compared to baselines, offering a viable path for more
effective early-phase decision-making in personalized combination drug screens.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study develops a multi-omics based support vector regression (SVR) model to predict gross tumor volume (GTV) changes, outperforming single-omics models and achieving high accuracy with an R2 of 0.743.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate prediction of GTV changes can significantly impact patient prognosis and treatment adjustments during Personalized Ultra-Fractionated Stereotactic Adaptive Radiotherapy (PULSAR).

Method: The research used MRI-based radiomics, dose map-based dosiomics, and delta feature computation. Lasso algorithms and SVR models were applied, utilizing five-fold cross-validation with 10 repeats to counter limitations of a small dataset.

Result: Multi-omics models integrating radiomics, dosiomics, and respective delta features offered superior performance compared to single-omics approaches. The best model achieved an R2 of 0.743 and a RRMSE of 0.022.

Conclusion: The multi-omics SVR model effectively predicts GTV changes, providing a quantitative, personalized decision-making tool for patient selection and treatment strategy adjustments in PULSAR therapy.

Abstract: Personalized ultra-fractionated stereotactic adaptive radiotherapy (PULSAR)
is a novel treatment that delivers radiation in pulses of protracted intervals.
Accurate prediction of gross tumor volume (GTV) changes through regression
models has substantial prognostic value. This study aims to develop a
multi-omics based support vector regression (SVR) model for predicting GTV
change. A retrospective cohort of 39 patients with 69 brain metastases was
analyzed, based on radiomics (MRI images) and dosiomics (dose maps) features.
Delta features were computed to capture relative changes between two time
points. A feature selection pipeline using least absolute shrinkage and
selection operator (Lasso) algorithm with weight- or frequency-based ranking
criterion was implemented. SVR models with various kernels were evaluated using
the coefficient of determination (R2) and relative root mean square error
(RRMSE). Five-fold cross-validation with 10 repeats was employed to mitigate
the limitation of small data size. Multi-omics models that integrate radiomics,
dosiomics, and their delta counterparts outperform individual-omics models.
Delta-radiomic features play a critical role in enhancing prediction accuracy
relative to features at single time points. The top-performing model achieves
an R2 of 0.743 and an RRMSE of 0.022. The proposed multi-omics SVR model shows
promising performance in predicting continuous change of GTV. It provides a
more quantitative and personalized approach to assist patient selection and
treatment adjustment in PULSAR.

Motivation: The high training costs of LLMs make brute-force trial-and-error methods impractical for enhancing their performance.

Method: Advocates for applying inverse problems, commonly used for scientific laws discovery, to derive scaling laws for LLM development.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the feasibility of using in-ear electrodes for accurate and unobtrusive sleep monitoring in real-world settings, achieving promising results in sleep detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional EEG-based sleep monitoring systems are obtrusive and unsuitable for everyday use outside sleep labs, limiting their application in home settings for long-term monitoring and consumer use cases like detecting sleep onset.

Method: The authors conducted a sleep study with 11 participants using a custom in-ear device with single-channel electrophysiological signals and compared it to validated sleep staging from an Apple Watch Ultra. They employed leave-one-subject-out validation to assess the system's performance.

Result: The system achieved 90.5% accuracy for binary sleep detection (Awake vs. Asleep) and 65.1% accuracy for four-class sleep staging (Awake, REM, Core, Deep).

Conclusion: In-ear electrodes provide a comfortable and effective alternative to traditional EEG-based methods for sleep monitoring, enabling practical applications like pausing media playback when users fall asleep.

Abstract: Automatic sleep staging typically relies on gold-standard EEG setups, which
are accurate but obtrusive and impractical for everyday use outside sleep
laboratories. This limits applicability in real-world settings, such as home
environments, where continuous, long-term monitoring is needed. Detecting sleep
onset is particularly relevant, enabling consumer applications (e.g.
automatically pausing media playback when the user falls asleep). Recent
research has shown correlations between in-ear EEG and full-scalp EEG for
various phenomena, suggesting wearable, in-ear devices could allow unobtrusive
sleep monitoring. We investigated the feasibility of using single-channel
in-ear electrophysiological (ExG) signals for automatic sleep staging in a
wearable device by conducting a sleep study with 11~participants (mean age:
24), using a custom earpiece with a dry eartip electrode (D\"atwyler SoftPulse)
as a measurement electrode in one ear and a reference in the other. Ground
truth sleep stages were obtained from an Apple Watch Ultra, validated for sleep
staging. Our system achieved 90.5% accuracy for binary sleep detection (Awake
vs. Asleep) and 65.1% accuracy for four-class staging (Awake, REM, Core, Deep)
using leave-one-subject-out validation. These findings demonstrate the
potential of in-ear electrodes as a low-effort, comfortable approach to sleep
monitoring, with applications such as stopping podcasts when users fall asleep.

TL;DR: The paper addresses Online Convex-Concave Optimization by proposing a modular algorithm with minimized dynamic duality gap and adaptable components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing algorithms underperform in dynamic or predictable environments when minimizing the dynamic duality gap in convex-concave games.

Method: The proposed algorithm combines an Adaptive Module, Multi-Predictor Aggregator, and Integration Module for minimax optimal performance and adaptability.

Result: The algorithm achieves minimax optimal D-DGap bounds and shows effective integration of predictors in both theoretical guarantees and empirical tests.

Conclusion: The modular algorithm is proven to be effective, adaptable to dynamic environments, and capable of integrating multiple predictors flexibly.

Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of Online Convex-Concave Optimization,
which extends Online Convex Optimization to two-player time-varying
convex-concave games. The goal is to minimize the dynamic duality gap (D-DGap),
a critical performance measure that evaluates players' strategies against
arbitrary comparator sequences. Existing algorithms fail to deliver optimal
performance, particularly in stationary or predictable environments. To address
this, we propose a novel modular algorithm with three core components: an
Adaptive Module that dynamically adjusts to varying levels of non-stationarity,
a Multi-Predictor Aggregator that identifies the best predictor among multiple
candidates, and an Integration Module that effectively combines their
strengths. Our algorithm achieves a minimax optimal D-DGap upper bound, up to a
logarithmic factor, while also ensuring prediction error-driven D-DGap bounds.
The modular design allows for the seamless replacement of components that
regulate adaptability to dynamic environments, as well as the incorporation of
components that integrate ``side knowledge'' from multiple predictors.
Empirical results further demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of the
proposed method.

### [218] [One Model for All Tasks: Leveraging Efficient World Models in Multi-Task Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07945)
*Yuan Pu,Yazhe Niu,Jia Tang,Junyu Xiong,Shuai Hu,Hongsheng Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces ScaleZero, a Mixture-of-Experts-based model for heterogeneous multi-task learning. It also proposes a LoRA-based dynamic parameter scaling strategy to improve efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of gradient conflicts and loss of model plasticity in large-scale heterogeneous multi-task learning environments.

Method: ScaleZero is developed using a Mixture-of-Experts architecture to mitigate gradient conflicts, and a LoRA-based dynamic parameter scaling strategy for adaptive knowledge retention and computational load balancing.

Result: Empirical evaluations show that ScaleZero achieves performance comparable to specialized single-task baselines and performs efficiently with 80% of the environment interaction steps.

Conclusion: ScaleZero demonstrates the viability of effective large-scale heterogeneous multi-task learning, achieving competitive performance while being computationally efficient.

Abstract: In heterogeneous multi-task learning, tasks not only exhibit diverse
observation and action spaces but also vary substantially in intrinsic
difficulty. While conventional multi-task world models like UniZero excel in
single-task settings, we find that when handling large-scale heterogeneous
environments, gradient conflicts and the loss of model plasticity often
constrain their sample and computational efficiency. In this work, we address
these challenges from two perspectives: the single learning iteration and the
overall learning process. First, we investigate the impact of key design spaces
on extending UniZero to multi-task planning. We find that a Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) architecture provides the most substantial performance gains by
mitigating gradient conflicts, leading to our proposed model,
\textit{ScaleZero}. Second, to dynamically balance the computational load
across the learning process, we introduce an online, LoRA-based \textit{dynamic
parameter scaling} (DPS) strategy. This strategy progressively integrates LoRA
adapters in response to task-specific progress, enabling adaptive knowledge
retention and parameter expansion. Empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks
such as Atari, DMControl (DMC), and Jericho demonstrate that ScaleZero, relying
exclusively on online reinforcement learning with one model, attains
performance on par with specialized single-task baselines. Furthermore, when
augmented with our dynamic parameter scaling strategy, our method achieves
competitive performance while requiring only 80\% of the single-task
environment interaction steps. These findings underscore the potential of
ScaleZero for effective large-scale multi-task learning. Our code is available

*Kasra Borazjani,Naji Khosravan,Rajeev Sahay,Bita Akram,Seyyedali Hosseinalipour*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces M3T Federated Foundation Models (FedFMs) for privacy-preserving, multi-modal, and personalized collaborative learning in education.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address challenges such as data privacy, decentralized data, and limited education-specific data to deploy transformative AI models in education.

Method: Integrating federated learning (FL) with multi-modal multi-task (M3T) foundation models to create privacy-preserving, collaborative training systems suitable for diverse educational tasks.

Result: Proposed a framework for privacy preservation, personalization, and inclusivity in education, along with a list of open research challenges for further development and deployment.

Conclusion: M3T FedFMs hold promise in advancing education systems by addressing privacy, personalization, and inclusivity, but key challenges need further exploration for practical use.

Abstract: Multi-modal multi-task (M3T) foundation models (FMs) have recently shown
transformative potential in artificial intelligence, with emerging applications
in education. However, their deployment in real-world educational settings is
hindered by privacy regulations, data silos, and limited domain-specific data
availability. We introduce M3T Federated Foundation Models (FedFMs) for
education: a paradigm that integrates federated learning (FL) with M3T FMs to
enable collaborative, privacy-preserving training across decentralized
institutions while accommodating diverse modalities and tasks. Subsequently,
this position paper aims to unveil M3T FedFMs as a promising yet underexplored
approach to the education community, explore its potentials, and reveal its
related future research directions. We outline how M3T FedFMs can advance three
critical pillars of next-generation intelligent education systems: (i) privacy
preservation, by keeping sensitive multi-modal student and institutional data
local; (ii) personalization, through modular architectures enabling tailored
models for students, instructors, and institutions; and (iii) equity and
inclusivity, by facilitating participation from underrepresented and
resource-constrained entities. We finally identify various open research
challenges, including studying of (i) inter-institution heterogeneous privacy
regulations, (ii) the non-uniformity of data modalities' characteristics, (iii)
the unlearning approaches for M3T FedFMs, (iv) the continual learning
frameworks for M3T FedFMs, and (v) M3T FedFM model interpretability, which must
be collectively addressed for practical deployment.

### [220] [ACE and Diverse Generalization via Selective Disagreement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07955)
*Oliver Daniels,Stuart Armstrong,Alexandre Maranhão,Mahirah Fairuz Rahman,Benjamin M. Marlin,Rebecca Gorman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ACE, a method to address challenges posed by spurious correlations in deep neural networks, particularly in scenarios of complete correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to dealing with spurious correlations in deep neural networks often rely on partially labeled data breaking the correlation, but fail in cases of complete correlations where correct generalization is underspecified.

Method: ACE uses a self-training strategy that focuses on confident and selective disagreement to learn concepts consistent with training data but predictive for novel unlabeled inputs.

Result: ACE performs as well as or better than existing methods on benchmarks for complete spurious correlations and maintains robustness in instances of incomplete spurious correlations.

Conclusion: ACE shows promise in addressing underspecification, offers configurability for encoding prior knowledge, and achieves competitive performance in applied use cases like language-model alignment.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are notoriously sensitive to spurious correlations -
where a model learns a shortcut that fails out-of-distribution. Existing work
on spurious correlations has often focused on incomplete
correlations,leveraging access to labeled instances that break the correlation.
But in cases where the spurious correlations are complete, the correct
generalization is fundamentally \textit{underspecified}. To resolve this
underspecification, we propose learning a set of concepts that are consistent
with training data but make distinct predictions on a subset of novel unlabeled
inputs. Using a self-training approach that encourages \textit{confident} and
\textit{selective} disagreement, our method ACE matches or outperforms existing
methods on a suite of complete-spurious correlation benchmarks, while remaining
robust to incomplete spurious correlations. ACE is also more configurable than
prior approaches, allowing for straight-forward encoding of prior knowledge and
principled unsupervised model selection. In an early application to
language-model alignment, we find that ACE achieves competitive performance on
the measurement tampering detection benchmark \textit{without} access to
untrusted measurements. While still subject to important limitations, ACE
represents significant progress towards overcoming underspecification.

### [221] [Customizing the Inductive Biases of Softmax Attention using Structured Matrices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07963)
*Yilun Kuang,Noah Amsel,Sanae Lotfi,Shikai Qiu,Andres Potapczynski,Andrew Gordon Wilson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes novel scoring functions for attention mechanisms using structured matrices to address efficiency and locality issues, achieving better performance on regression, language modeling, and forecasting tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges with standard attention mechanisms include information loss due to low-dimensional projections and inefficiency in capturing locality patterns or distance-dependent biases.

Method: The authors introduce scoring functions based on high-rank structured matrices (Block Tensor-Train and Multi-Level Low Rank) to improve computational efficiency and performance.

Result: The proposed methods outperform standard attention in tasks with high-dimensional inputs, improve scaling laws in language modeling, and deliver promising results in long-range forecasting.

Conclusion: Efficient structured matrices like BTT and MLR can overcome limitations of standard attention, contributing to improvements across diverse domains.

Abstract: The core component of attention is the scoring function, which transforms the
inputs into low-dimensional queries and keys and takes the dot product of each
pair. While the low-dimensional projection improves efficiency, it causes
information loss for certain tasks that have intrinsically high-dimensional
inputs. Additionally, attention uses the same scoring function for all input
pairs, without imposing a distance-dependent compute bias for neighboring
tokens in the sequence. In this work, we address these shortcomings by
proposing new scoring functions based on computationally efficient structured
matrices with high ranks, including Block Tensor-Train (BTT) and Multi-Level
Low Rank (MLR) matrices. On in-context regression tasks with high-dimensional
inputs, our proposed scoring functions outperform standard attention for any
fixed compute budget. On language modeling, a task that exhibits locality
patterns, our MLR-based attention method achieves improved scaling laws
compared to both standard attention and variants of sliding window attention.
Additionally, we show that both BTT and MLR fall under a broader family of
efficient structured matrices capable of encoding either full-rank or
distance-dependent compute biases, thereby addressing significant shortcomings
of standard attention. Finally, we show that MLR attention has promising
results for long-range time-series forecasting.

### [222] [Theoretical Analysis on how Learning Rate Warmup Accelerates Convergence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07972)
*Yuxing Liu,Yuze Ge,Rui Pan,An Kang,Tong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates the theoretical benefits of learning rate warmup in deep neural network training, and shows that it can achieve up to $
Theta(T)$ faster convergence in certain scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Although learning rate warmup is commonly used in practice for training deep neural networks, its theoretical advantages are not well understood, creating a gap between practice and theory.

Method: The authors introduce a new family of generalized smoothness assumptions to analyze the convergence properties of gradient descent (GD) under this framework. They validate these assumptions theoretically and empirically and study deterministic and stochastic settings.

Result: Learning rate warmup is shown to consistently enhance the convergence speed of gradient descent, reaching up to $
Theta(T)$ times faster convergence in specific cases compared to non-increasing learning rate schedules.

Conclusion: The study provides a theoretical foundation explaining the benefits of learning rate warmup from an optimization theory perspective, bridging the gap between theoretical understanding and practical success.

Abstract: Learning rate warmup is a popular and practical technique in training
large-scale deep neural networks. Despite the huge success in practice, the
theoretical advantages of this strategy of gradually increasing the learning
rate at the beginning of the training process have not been fully understood.
To resolve this gap between theory and practice, we first propose a novel
family of generalized smoothness assumptions, and validate its applicability
both theoretically and empirically. Under the novel smoothness assumption, we
study the convergence properties of gradient descent (GD) in both deterministic
and stochastic settings. It is shown that learning rate warmup consistently
accelerates GD, and GD with warmup can converge at most $\Theta(T)$ times
faster than with a non-increasing learning rate schedule in some specific
cases, providing insights into the benefits of this strategy from an
optimization theory perspective.

### [223] [A multi-strategy improved gazelle optimization algorithm for solving numerical optimization and engineering applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07211)
*Qi Diao,Chengyue Xie,Yuchen Yin,Hoileong Lee,Haolong Yang*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper proposes an improved gazelle optimization algorithm (MSIGOA) to address imbalances in exploration and exploitation and to improve information exchange within the population, resulting in better convergence and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The gazelle optimization algorithm (GOA) suffers from issues like poor balance between exploration and exploitation, and insufficient information exchange, which limits its optimization performance.

Method: MSIGOA introduces an iteration-based framework for dynamic switching between exploration and exploitation, adaptive parameter tuning strategies, and a population-based restart strategy to prevent premature convergence.

Result: MSIGOA outperformed basic GOA and other algorithms on benchmark tests (CEC2017 and CEC2022), with improved performance on 92.2% and 83.3% of functions, respectively, for GOA comparisons, and 88.57% and 87.5% for other algorithms.

Conclusion: The proposed MSIGOA enhances convergence speed, stability, and efficiency, proving its applicability to benchmark tests as well as practical engineering design optimization problems.

Abstract: Aiming at the shortcomings of the gazelle optimization algorithm, such as the
imbalance between exploration and exploitation and the insufficient information
exchange within the population, this paper proposes a multi-strategy improved
gazelle optimization algorithm (MSIGOA). To address these issues, MSIGOA
proposes an iteration-based updating framework that switches between
exploitation and exploration according to the optimization process, which
effectively enhances the balance between local exploitation and global
exploration in the optimization process and improves the convergence speed. Two
adaptive parameter tuning strategies improve the applicability of the algorithm
and promote a smoother optimization process. The dominant population-based
restart strategy enhances the algorithms ability to escape from local optima
and avoid its premature convergence. These enhancements significantly improve
the exploration and exploitation capabilities of MSIGOA, bringing superior
convergence and efficiency in dealing with complex problems. In this paper, the
parameter sensitivity, strategy effectiveness, convergence and stability of the
proposed method are evaluated on two benchmark test sets including CEC2017 and
CEC2022. Test results and statistical tests show that MSIGOA outperforms basic
GOA and other advanced algorithms. On the CEC2017 and CEC2022 test sets, the
proportion of functions where MSIGOA is not worse than GOA is 92.2% and 83.3%,
respectively, and the proportion of functions where MSIGOA is not worse than
other algorithms is 88.57% and 87.5%, respectively. Finally, the extensibility
of MSIGAO is further verified by several engineering design optimization
problems.

### [224] [Breaking the Conventional Forward-Backward Tie in Neural Networks: Activation Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07236)
*Luigi Troiano,Francesco Gissi,Vincenzo Benedetto,Genny Tortora*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper challenges the necessity of strict symmetry between forward and backward propagation in neural network training, demonstrating that gradient magnitude is less important than gradient direction for learning efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional neural network training imposes restrictive constraints on activation functions due to the enforced symmetry between forward and backward propagation, limiting design flexibility.

Method: Mathematical analysis and empirical experiments were conducted to explore the effects of relaxing forward-backward symmetry using architectures like MLPs, CNNs, and BNNs, alongside activation functions with flat or non-differentiable regions.

Result: Relaxing symmetry and using alternatives to precise gradients did not impair learning; it improved training stability and efficiency, enabling effective training with non-differentiable activation functions like the Heaviside step function.

Conclusion: Strictly enforcing symmetry in forward and backward propagation is unnecessary, offering greater flexibility in activation functions and computational efficiency, paving the way for further exploration in complex architectures.

Abstract: Gradient-based neural network training traditionally enforces symmetry
between forward and backward propagation, requiring activation functions to be
differentiable (or sub-differentiable) and strictly monotonic in certain
regions to prevent flat gradient areas. This symmetry, linking forward
activations closely to backward gradients, significantly restricts the
selection of activation functions, particularly excluding those with
substantial flat or non-differentiable regions. In this paper, we challenge
this assumption through mathematical analysis, demonstrating that precise
gradient magnitudes derived from activation functions are largely redundant,
provided the gradient direction is preserved. Empirical experiments conducted
on foundational architectures - such as Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs),
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) -
confirm that relaxing forward-backward symmetry and substituting traditional
gradients with simpler or stochastic alternatives does not impair learning and
may even enhance training stability and efficiency. We explicitly demonstrate
that neural networks with flat or non-differentiable activation functions, such
as the Heaviside step function, can be effectively trained, thereby expanding
design flexibility and computational efficiency. Further empirical validation
with more complex architectures remains a valuable direction for future
research.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper introduces Word2Spike, a technique mapping word embeddings to spiking neural networks for energy-efficient semantic encoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve energy-efficient and brain-like associative memory using spiking neural networks while preserving high semantic performance.

Method: Using Poisson processes, this paper maps multi-dimensional word embeddings to spike-based states with optimized quantization methods.

Result: The approach delivers 97% semantic similarity, 100% reconstruction accuracy of embeddings, and noise-resilient analogy preservation.

Conclusion: Word2Spike illustrates robust, neuromorphic semantic encoding and opens avenues for integrating advanced spiking networks.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks offer a promising path toward energy-efficient,
brain-like associative memory. This paper introduces Word2Spike, a novel rate
coding mechanism that combines continuous word embeddings and neuromorphic
architectures. We develop a one-to-one mapping that converts multi-dimensional
word vectors into spike-based attractor states using Poisson processes. Using
BitNet b1.58 quantization, we maintain 97% semantic similarity of continuous
embeddings on SimLex-999 while achieving 100% reconstruction accuracy on 10,000
words from OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large. We preserve analogy performance
(100% of original embedding performance) even under intentionally introduced
noise, indicating a resilient mechanism for semantic encoding in neuromorphic
systems. Next steps include integrating the mapping with spiking transformers
and liquid state machines (resembling Hopfield Networks) for further
evaluation.

*Hai Dinh-Tuan*

Main category: cs.PF

TL;DR: The paper compares the performance of containers vs unikernels under memory constraints in edge environments using Go (AOT) and Node.js (JIT) applications, identifying critical trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the insufficiently explored trade-offs between containers and unikernels in industrial edge environments with severe resource constraints, especially across different execution models.

Method: Conducting empirical comparisons of Go-based (AOT) and Node.js-based (JIT) applications across containers and unikernels under constrained memory conditions.

Result: Unikernels outperform containers for Go workloads in constrained environments, but containers maintain stable performance for Node.js workloads below certain memory thresholds where unikernels degrade sharply.

Conclusion: The optimal deployment strategy between containers and unikernels depends on runtime behavior and memory availability, requiring workload-aware deployment in edge computing.

Abstract: The choice between containers and unikernels is a critical trade-off for edge
applications, balancing the container's ecosystem maturity against unikernel's
specialized efficiency. However, until now, how this trade-off behaves under
the severe memory constraints of industrial edge environments remains
insufficiently investigated, especially across different execution models. This
work presents an empirical comparison using Go and Node.js applications,
representing ahead-of-time (AOT) and just-in-time (JIT) compilation,
respectively. While unikernels consistently deliver faster startup times and
outperform containers for Go-based workloads in resource-constrained
environments, the evaluation results identify a critical performance crossover
for Node.js. Below a certain memory threshold, Docker containers maintain
stable performance for both I/O-bound and CPU-bound applications, while the
Nanos unikernel's performance degrades sharply. This reveals that Linux's
memory management capabilities can outweigh the minimalist efficiency of
unikernels under resource scarcity, a critical trade-off that, until now, has
not been adequately quantified for JIT runtimes in this context. These findings
demonstrate that the optimal deployment paradigm depends on both runtime
behavior and available system resources, underscoring the need for
workload-aware deployment strategies in edge computing.

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: veScale is introduced as an efficient and consistent system for distributed tensor programming using the SPMD paradigm, improving performance and simplifying code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rising complexity of Large Language Models necessitates simpler programming paradigms for distributed training, addressing issues like consistency and scalability.

Method: veScale uses a novel distributed RNG algorithm, optimized PyTorch operations, and improved communication mechanics to align training outputs with single-device results and enhance scalability and efficiency.

Result: Evaluations show veScale achieves a 2.2x speedup over systems like TorchTitan and reduces code complexity by 78.4%, while maintaining result consistency.

Conclusion: veScale successfully democratizes distributed tensor programming with improved performance, reduced complexity, and consistent execution results across devices.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have scaled rapidly in size and complexity,
requiring increasingly intricate parallelism for distributed training, such as
3D parallelism. This sophistication motivates a shift toward simpler, more
debuggable programming paradigm like Single Program Multiple Data (SPMD).
However, SPMD in eager execution introduces two key challenges: ensuring
consistency with single-device execution and achieving high performance at
scale. In this paper, we introduce veScale, an eager-mode training system that
fully embraces SPMD paradigm to democratize distributed tensor programming.
veScale addresses the prevalent issue of inconsistent results in systems like
PyTorch by introducing a novel algorithm of distributed Random Number
Generation (RNG) compatible with arbitrary sharded operators. veScale also
significantly boosts training performance by reducing PyTorch primitive's
overhead and improving communication efficiency. Evaluations show that veScale
delivers up to 2.2x speedup over the state-of-the-art training systems, like
TorchTitan, and cuts code complexity by 78.4%, while preserving
single-device-equivalent results.

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper introduces micro embedding, a technique for efficient extensible language embeddings, addressing performance issues in macro embedding and improving compile-time efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the compile-time inefficiencies associated with macro embedding while still achieving extensible typed language implementations.

Method: Micro embedding transforms source syntax to an intermediate representation (IR), enabling efficient compile-time functions before embedding IR back into source syntax. Design patterns and new abstractions are introduced for extensibility.

Result: Micro embedding achieves extensible hybrid embedding with significantly improved compile-time performance compared to macro embedding.

Conclusion: Micro embedding enhances the practicality of embedding statically typed languages into host languages by improving extensibility and compile-time efficiency.

Abstract: Macro embedding is a popular approach to defining extensible shallow
embeddings of object languages in Scheme like host languages. While macro
embedding has even been shown to enable implementing extensible typed languages
in systems like Racket, it comes at a cost: compile-time performance. In this
paper, we revisit micros - syntax to intermediate representation (IR)
transformers, rather than source syntax to source syntax transformers (macros).
Micro embedding enables stopping at an IR, producing a deep embedding and
enabling high performance compile-time functions over an efficient IR, before
shallowly embedding the IR back into source syntax. Combining micros with
several design patterns to enable the IR and functions over it to be
extensible, we achieve extensible hybrid embedding of statically typed
languages with significantly improved compile-time compared to macro-embedding
approaches. We describe our design patterns and propose new abstractions
packaging these patterns.

*Yichen Xu,Oliver Bračevac,Cao Nguyen Pham,Martin Odersky*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: This paper introduces System Capless, a theoretical framework for addressing limitations in Scala's capturing types mechanism, enabling better tracking of capabilities in generic data structures and practical integration with the Scala collections library.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the limitations of Scala's capturing types mechanism, particularly its inability to handle capabilities within generic data structures, which hampers broader adoption.

Method: Develop the System Capless framework leveraging reach capabilities (rcaps) for naming capabilities inside generic types. Mechanize the system in Lean for formal proof, and implement it in Scala 3 to assess practicality.

Result: System Capless enables optional explicit capture-set quantification, enhances expressiveness, integrates seamlessly into Scala collections and async libraries, and is adopted with minimal code changes and notational overhead.

Conclusion: Reach capabilities and System Capless address the shortcomings of previous capturing type systems, paving the way for more scalable and ergonomic capture checking within production code in Scala.

Abstract: Capturing types in Scala unify static effect and resource tracking with
object capabilities, enabling lightweight effect polymorphism with minimal
notational overhead. However, their expressiveness has been insufficient for
tracking capabilities embedded in generic data structures, preventing them from
scaling to the standard collections library -- an essential prerequisite for
broader adoption. This limitation stems from the inability to name capabilities
within the system's notion of box types.
  This paper develops System Capless, a new foundation for capturing types that
provides the theoretical basis for reach capabilities (rcaps), a novel
mechanism for naming "what's in the box." The calculus refines the universal
capability notion into a new scheme with existential and universal capture set
quantification. Intuitively, rcaps witness existentially quantified capture
sets inside the boxes of generic types in a way that does not require exposing
existential capture types in the surface language. We have fully mechanized the
formal metatheory of System Capless in Lean, including proofs of type soundness
and scope safety. System Capless supports the same lightweight notation of
capturing types plus rcaps, as certified by a type-preserving translation, and
also enables fully optional explicit capture-set quantification to increase
expressiveness.
  Finally, we present a full reimplementation of capture checking in Scala 3
based on System Capless and migrate the entire Scala collections library and an
asynchronous programming library to evaluate its practicality and ergonomics.
Our results demonstrate that reach capabilities enable the adoption of capture
checking in production code with minimal changes and minimal-to-zero notational
overhead in a vast majority of cases.

*Martin Matak,Mohanraj Devendran Ashanti,Karl Van Wyk,Tucker Hermans*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenges in robotic multi-ﬁnger grasping by presenting a novel parallel planning framework that improves grasp success rates and reduces time compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the limitations of existing grasping methods in robotic manipulation, such as sensitivity to initialization, inefficiency in trajectory planning, and trade-offs between accuracy and computation time.

Method: The authors introduce a parallel trajectory planning framework where trajectories are planned to multiple grasp targets simultaneously using a vectorized motion planner. The evaluator estimates grasp success likelihood for each trajectory, and the robot executes the most promising one.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the traditional generator-evaluator-planner framework in terms of efficiency and success rates across diverse objects and environments. It also generalizes successfully to novel real-world settings.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a promising solution to address key inefficiencies in robotic grasping, providing improved scalability, accuracy, and adaptability for real-world applications.

Abstract: Autonomous multi-finger grasping is a fundamental capability in robotic
manipulation. Optimization-based approaches show strong performance, but tend
to be sensitive to initialization and are potentially time-consuming. As an
alternative, the generator-evaluator-planner framework has been proposed. A
generator generates grasp candidates, an evaluator ranks the proposed grasps,
and a motion planner plans a trajectory to the highest-ranked grasp. If the
planner doesn't find a trajectory, a new trajectory optimization is started
with the next-best grasp as the target and so on. However, executing
lower-ranked grasps means a lower chance of grasp success, and multiple
trajectory optimizations are time-consuming. Alternatively, relaxing the
threshold for motion planning accuracy allows for easier computation of a
successful trajectory but implies lower accuracy in estimating grasp success
likelihood. It's a lose-lose proposition: either spend more time finding a
successful trajectory or have a worse estimate of grasp success. We propose a
framework that plans trajectories to a set of generated grasp targets in
parallel, the evaluator estimates the grasp success likelihood of the resulting
trajectories, and the robot executes the trajectory most likely to succeed. To
plan trajectories to different targets efficiently, we propose the use of a
vectorized motion planner. Our experiments show our approach improves over the
traditional generator-evaluator-planner framework across different objects,
generators, and motion planners, and successfully generalizes to novel
environments in the real world, including different shelves and table heights.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the computational challenge of optimizing robotic manipulators in high-dimensional configuration spaces, which classical methods struggle to efficiently address.

Method: The authors integrate parameterized quantum circuits for forward kinematics modeling with Grover's algorithm to create an oracle for efficient search and optimization.

Result: The framework achieves up to 93x speedup compared to classical optimizer Nelder Mead, especially as problem dimensionality grows.

Conclusion: This work introduces a novel quantum-native approach for robotic kinematic optimization, marking a significant contribution to bridging quantum computing and robotics.

Abstract: Optimizing high-degree of freedom robotic manipulators requires searching
complex, high-dimensional configuration spaces, a task that is computationally
challenging for classical methods. This paper introduces a quantum native
framework that integrates quantum machine learning with Grover's algorithm to
solve kinematic optimization problems efficiently. A parameterized quantum
circuit is trained to approximate the forward kinematics model, which then
constructs an oracle to identify optimal configurations. Grover's algorithm
leverages this oracle to provide a quadratic reduction in search complexity.
Demonstrated on 1-DoF, 2-DoF, and dual-arm manipulator tasks, the method
achieves significant speedups-up to 93x over classical optimizers like Nelder
Mead as problem dimensionality increases. This work establishes a foundational,
quantum-native framework for robot kinematic optimization, effectively bridging
quantum computing and robotics problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of formal analysis of dynamic obstacles in current perception-informed local planners for dynamic environments.

Method: The method involves tracking and estimating dynamic gaps in polar regions of free space, using gap propagation algorithms to predict feasible regions, applying pursuit guidance for collision-free trajectories, and incorporating ungap processing for obstacle-centric scenarios.

Abstract: This chapter extends the family of perception-informed gap-based local
planners to dynamic environments. Existing perception-informed local planners
that operate in dynamic environments often rely on emergent or empirical
robustness for collision avoidance as opposed to performing formal analysis of
dynamic obstacles. This proposed planner, dynamic gap, explicitly addresses
dynamic obstacles through several steps in the planning pipeline. First, polar
regions of free space known as gaps are tracked and their dynamics are
estimated in order to understand how the local environment evolves over time.
Then, at planning time, gaps are propagated into the future through novel gap
propagation algorithms to understand what regions are feasible for passage.
Lastly, pursuit guidance theory is leveraged to generate local trajectories
that are provably collision-free under ideal conditions. Additionally,
obstacle-centric ungap processing is performed in situations where no gaps
exist to robustify the overall planning framework. A set of gap-based planners
are benchmarked against a series of classical and learned motion planners in
dynamic environments, and dynamic gap is shown to outperform all other
baselines in all environments. Furthermore, dynamic gap is deployed on a
TurtleBot2 platform in several real-world experiments to validate collision
avoidance behaviors.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The abstract evaluates MUONS, a point-cloud-based navigation system, through robust simulations and field tests for autonomous off-road navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance autonomous off-road navigation by analyzing the performance of MUONS using comprehensive simulations and real-world testing.

Method: Performed 30,000 simulation trials across diverse terrains and configurations, followed by field validation, focusing on planning parameters and statistical correlations.

Result: MUONS achieved a 0.98 success rate in simulations and flawless field performance, identifying key performance-correlated parameters such as the Bi-RRT expansion radius.

Conclusion: Monte-Carlo simulations are effective for assessing navigation system performance and optimizing parameters, ensuring robust off-road autonomy.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of a point-cloud-based navigation
stack, MUONS, for autonomous off-road navigation. Performance is characterized
by analyzing the results of 30,000 planning and navigation trials in simulation
and validated through field testing. Our simulation campaign considers three
kinematically challenging terrain maps and twenty combinations of seven
path-planning parameters. In simulation, our MUONS-equipped AGV achieved a 0.98
success rate and experienced no failures in the field. By statistical and
correlation analysis we determined that the Bi-RRT expansion radius used in the
initial planning stages is most correlated with performance in terms of
planning time and traversed path length. Finally, we observed that the
proportional variation due to changes in the tuning parameters is remarkably
well correlated to performance in field testing. This finding supports the use
of Monte-Carlo simulation campaigns for performance assessment and parameter
tuning.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in visual localization in dense urban environments, proposing a new large-scale dataset integrating ground-level imagery and ALS point clouds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to improve visual localization accuracy in urban settings, overcoming issues like textureless surfaces and viewpoint changes, while leveraging the availability of ALS data.

Method: A large-scale dataset is introduced to integrate ground-level imagery from mobile mapping systems with ALS point clouds from Wuhan, Hong Kong, and San Francisco.

Result: The dataset addresses gaps related to platform-diverse datasets and reliable ground-truth generation, allowing validation of Image-to-Point Cloud (I2P) algorithms under aerial-ground settings.

Conclusion: This work advances scalable and precise visual localization by tackling limitations in existing methods and providing new tools for research in urban environments.

Abstract: Accurate visual localization in dense urban environments poses a fundamental
task in photogrammetry, geospatial information science, and robotics. While
imagery is a low-cost and widely accessible sensing modality, its effectiveness
on visual odometry is often limited by textureless surfaces, severe viewpoint
changes, and long-term drift. The growing public availability of airborne laser
scanning (ALS) data opens new avenues for scalable and precise visual
localization by leveraging ALS as a prior map. However, the potential of
ALS-based localization remains underexplored due to three key limitations: (1)
the lack of platform-diverse datasets, (2) the absence of reliable ground-truth
generation methods applicable to large-scale urban environments, and (3)
limited validation of existing Image-to-Point Cloud (I2P) algorithms under
aerial-ground cross-platform settings. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce a new large-scale dataset that integrates ground-level imagery from
mobile mapping systems with ALS point clouds collected in Wuhan, Hong Kong, and
San Francisco.

*Sichao Wu,Jiang Wu,Xingyu Cao,Fawang Zhang,Guangyuan Yu,Junjie Zhao,Yue Qu,Fei Ma,Jingliang Duan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Traditional MPC methods face computational challenges; explicit MPC simplifies computation but sacrifices accuracy for complex systems. TransMPC leverages Transformer models for real-time, high-accuracy control of complex systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MPC methods either struggle with computational complexity or oversimplify system dynamics, which compromises their accuracy for sophisticated applications.

Method: The paper introduces a Transformer-based MPC model using bidirectional self-attention for simultaneous inference of control sequences. It implements direct policy optimization using random horizon sampling and a replay buffer, ensuring robust training.

Result: TransMPC demonstrated high solution accuracy, adaptability to varying prediction horizons, and computational efficiency through simulations and real-world vehicle control experiments.

Conclusion: TransMPC offers a transformative approach to MPC by efficiently combining deep learning techniques with explicit MPC, making it suitable for complex systems requiring real-time solutions.

Abstract: Traditional online Model Predictive Control (MPC) methods often suffer from
excessive computational complexity, limiting their practical deployment.
Explicit MPC mitigates online computational load by pre-computing control
policies offline; however, existing explicit MPC methods typically rely on
simplified system dynamics and cost functions, restricting their accuracy for
complex systems. This paper proposes TransMPC, a novel Transformer-based
explicit MPC algorithm capable of generating highly accurate control sequences
in real-time for complex dynamic systems. Specifically, we formulate the MPC
policy as an encoder-only Transformer leveraging bidirectional self-attention,
enabling simultaneous inference of entire control sequences in a single forward
pass. This design inherently accommodates variable prediction horizons while
ensuring low inference latency. Furthermore, we introduce a direct policy
optimization framework that alternates between sampling and learning phases.
Unlike imitation-based approaches dependent on precomputed optimal
trajectories, TransMPC directly optimizes the true finite-horizon cost via
automatic differentiation. Random horizon sampling combined with a replay
buffer provides independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) training
samples, ensuring robust generalization across varying states and horizon
lengths. Extensive simulations and real-world vehicle control experiments
validate the effectiveness of TransMPC in terms of solution accuracy,
adaptability to varying horizons, and computational efficiency.

### [236] [Attention and Risk-Aware Decision Framework for Safe Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07412)
*Zhen Tian,Fujiang Yuan,Yangfan He,Qinghao Li,Changlin Chen,Huilin Chen,Tianxiang Xu,Jianyu Duan,Yanhong Peng,Zhihao Lin*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper improves Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for safer and more efficient autonomous driving by introducing a suite of mechanisms to avoid collisions and enhance training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper lies in addressing the limitations of existing autonomous driving models, particularly the poor training results and efficiency issues of the PPO method, which can translate to collisions in driving tasks.

Method: This paper improves PPO by introducing four key components: a risk-aware mechanism for safe driving learning, a balanced reward function to encourage efficient training, a risk-attention decision network to focus on high-risk areas, and a safety-assisted mechanism to avoid collision-prone actions.

Result: The enhanced PPO algorithm demonstrated superior performance in simulations, achieving fewer collisions, higher peak rewards, faster training, and shorter times spent in risky situations compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The proposed improvements to PPO make it more effective and reliable for autonomous driving tasks, significantly reducing collision risks while improving training efficiency and driving performance.

Abstract: Autonomous driving has attracted great interest due to its potential
capability in full-unsupervised driving. Model-based and learning-based methods
are widely used in autonomous driving. Model-based methods rely on pre-defined
models of the environment and may struggle with unforeseen events. Proximal
policy optimization (PPO), an advanced learning-based method, can adapt to the
above limits by learning from interactions with the environment. However,
existing PPO faces challenges with poor training results, and low training
efficiency in long sequences. Moreover, the poor training results are
equivalent to collisions in driving tasks. To solve these issues, this paper
develops an improved PPO by introducing the risk-aware mechanism, a
risk-attention decision network, a balanced reward function, and a
safety-assisted mechanism. The risk-aware mechanism focuses on highlighting
areas with potential collisions, facilitating safe-driving learning of the PPO.
The balanced reward function adjusts rewards based on the number of surrounding
vehicles, promoting efficient exploration of the control strategy during
training. Additionally, the risk-attention network enhances the PPO to hold
channel and spatial attention for the high-risk areas of input images.
Moreover, the safety-assisted mechanism supervises and prevents the actions
with risks of collisions during the lane keeping and lane changing. Simulation
results on a physical engine demonstrate that the proposed algorithm
outperforms benchmark algorithms in collision avoidance, achieving higher peak
reward with less training time, and shorter driving time remaining on the risky
areas among multiple testing traffic flow scenarios.

*Yuhan Pang,Bingyi Xia,Zhe Zhang,Zhirui Sun,Peijia Xie,Bike Zhu,Wenjun Xu,Jiankun Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces an optimization-based Visual Servoing scheme for service robots to enhance their precision and robustness in trolley docking, supported by experimental validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve autonomous trolley collection in public spaces by addressing challenges in vision-based robotic docking systems, such as environmental disturbances and precision requirements.

Method: The authors developed a framework using optimization-based Visual Servoing with active infrared markers and modeling nonholonomic kinematics and visibility constraints, combined with disturbance rejection mechanisms.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate robustness and high docking accuracy in diverse environments.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers a reliable solution for precise and stable trolley docking, enhancing service robot efficiency in public spaces.

Abstract: Service robots have demonstrated significant potential for autonomous trolley
collection and redistribution in public spaces like airports or warehouses to
improve efficiency and reduce cost. Usually, a fully autonomous system for the
collection and transportation of multiple trolleys is based on a
Leader-Follower formation of mobile manipulators, where reliable docking
maneuvers of the mobile base are essential to align trolleys into organized
queues. However, developing a vision-based robotic docking system faces
significant challenges: high precision requirements, environmental
disturbances, and inherent robot constraints. To address these challenges, we
propose an optimization-based Visual Servoing scheme that incorporates active
infrared markers for robust feature extraction across diverse lighting
conditions. This framework explicitly models nonholonomic kinematics and
visibility constraints within the Hybrid Visual Servoing problem, augmented
with an observer for disturbance rejection to ensure precise and stable
docking. Experimental results across diverse environments demonstrate the
robustness of this system, with quantitative evaluations confirming high
docking accuracy.

### [238] [Timing the Message: Language-Based Notifications for Time-Critical Assistive Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07438)
*Ya-Chuan Hsu,Jonathan DeCastro,Andrew Silva,Guy Rosman*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper addresses the trade-off between timeliness and informativeness in language-based assistive systems for time-critical settings, using reinforcement learning and a generated dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In time-critical scenarios like assistive driving, current assistive systems struggle to balance promptness and clarity, which can lead to delays or misunderstanding in critical moments.

Method: The authors framed the problem as an augmented-state Markov Decision Process, developed a reinforcement learning framework, and used a scalable pipeline to generate a taxonomy dataset for evaluation.

Result: Their framework achieved over 40% improvement in success rates compared to methods that did not consider time delays, while balancing the trade-off between timeliness and informativeness.

Conclusion: The study highlights the critical trade-off between timeliness and informativeness in human-AI communication and demonstrates potential new directions for optimizing these systems in time-sensitive environments.

Abstract: In time-critical settings such as assistive driving, assistants often rely on
alerts or haptic signals to prompt rapid human attention, but these cues
usually leave humans to interpret situations and decide responses
independently, introducing potential delays or ambiguity in meaning.
Language-based assistive systems can instead provide instructions backed by
context, offering more informative guidance. However, current approaches (e.g.,
social assistive robots) largely prioritize content generation while
overlooking critical timing factors such as verbal conveyance duration, human
comprehension delays, and subsequent follow-through duration. These timing
considerations are crucial in time-critical settings, where even minor delays
can substantially affect outcomes. We aim to study this inherent trade-off
between timeliness and informativeness by framing the challenge as a sequential
decision-making problem using an augmented-state Markov Decision Process. We
design a framework combining reinforcement learning and a generated offline
taxonomy dataset, where we balance the trade-off while enabling a scalable
taxonomy dataset generation pipeline. Empirical evaluation with synthetic
humans shows our framework improves success rates by over 40% compared to
methods that ignore time delays, while effectively balancing timeliness and
informativeness. It also exposes an often-overlooked trade-off between these
two factors, opening new directions for optimizing communication in
time-critical human-AI assistance.

TL;DR: Text2Touch leverages large language models (LLMs) to automate reward design for tactile-based dexterous manipulation, showing superior performance compared to human-engineered methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the lack of work on using tactile sensing in LLM-generated rewards for dexterous object manipulation, a critical element for achieving human-like manipulation capabilities.

Method: The researchers used prompt engineering with over 70 variables and sim-to-real distillation to transfer policies to a tactile-enabled robotic hand, leveraging simpler reward functions crafted by LLMs.

Result: Text2Touch outperformed human-engineered baselines in terms of rotation speed and stability for challenging in-hand object rotation tasks with tactile sensing.

Conclusion: LLM-designed rewards enable more efficient development of tactile-dexterous skills, reducing the time and complexity associated with traditional human-engineered methods and supporting scalable robot learning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are beginning to automate reward design for
dexterous manipulation. However, no prior work has considered tactile sensing,
which is known to be critical for human-like dexterity. We present Text2Touch,
bringing LLM-crafted rewards to the challenging task of multi-axis in-hand
object rotation with real-world vision based tactile sensing in palm-up and
palm-down configurations. Our prompt engineering strategy scales to over 70
environment variables, and sim-to-real distillation enables successful policy
transfer to a tactile-enabled fully actuated four-fingered dexterous robot
hand. Text2Touch significantly outperforms a carefully tuned human-engineered
baseline, demonstrating superior rotation speed and stability while relying on
reward functions that are an order of magnitude shorter and simpler. These
results illustrate how LLM-designed rewards can significantly reduce the time
from concept to deployable dexterous tactile skills, supporting more rapid and
scalable multimodal robot learning. Project website:

*Sven Kirchner,Nils Purschke,Ross Greer,Alois C. Knoll*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents DepthVision, a multimodal framework blending synthesized RGB data from LiDAR and real RGB visuals to enhance scene understanding in degraded visual conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual input often becomes unreliable in scenarios like low light or sensor degradation, posing challenges for robotics operations.

Method: DepthVision synthesizes RGB images from sparse LiDAR data using GANs, refines them, and dynamically combines them with real RGB data based on lighting conditions.

Result: Experimental results show improved performance in low-light safety-critical tasks, outperforming RGB-only systems while remaining compatible with frozen vision-language models.

Conclusion: The study showcases LiDAR-guided RGB synthesis as a robust solution for ensuring reliable robot operation in challenging environments.

Abstract: Ensuring reliable robot operation when visual input is degraded or
insufficient remains a central challenge in robotics. This letter introduces
DepthVision, a framework for multimodal scene understanding designed to address
this problem. Unlike existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which use only
camera-based visual input alongside language, DepthVision synthesizes RGB
images from sparse LiDAR point clouds using a conditional generative
adversarial network (GAN) with an integrated refiner network. These synthetic
views are then combined with real RGB data using a Luminance-Aware Modality
Adaptation (LAMA), which blends the two types of data dynamically based on
ambient lighting conditions. This approach compensates for sensor degradation,
such as darkness or motion blur, without requiring any fine-tuning of
downstream vision-language models. We evaluate DepthVision on real and
simulated datasets across various models and tasks, with particular attention
to safety-critical tasks. The results demonstrate that our approach improves
performance in low-light conditions, achieving substantial gains over RGB-only
baselines while preserving compatibility with frozen VLMs. This work highlights
the potential of LiDAR-guided RGB synthesis for achieving robust robot
operation in real-world environments.

*Rui Yang,Lei Zheng,Shuzhi Sam Ge,Jun Ma*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a real-time trajectory optimization framework for autonomous vehicles to balance safety and efficiency amidst uncertainties caused by human-driven vehicles' behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to navigate uncertain environments due to unpredictable human-driven vehicles and perception inaccuracies, while avoiding overly conservative planning, inspired this work.

Method: The authors developed an event-triggered online learning approach to estimate human vehicle behaviors, refined safe trajectory sets using barrier constraints, and solved trajectory optimization via ADMM.

Result: Simulations and real-world experiments showed improvements in driving efficiency, passenger comfort, and safety in various highway and urban scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed framework ensures safe and efficient navigation for autonomous vehicles, adapting dynamically to uncertain human driver behaviors without requiring overly conservative measures.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles must navigate dynamically uncertain environments while
balancing the safety and driving efficiency. This challenge is exacerbated by
the unpredictable nature of surrounding human-driven vehicles (HVs) and
perception inaccuracies, which require planners to adapt to evolving
uncertainties while maintaining safe trajectories. Overly conservative planners
degrade driving efficiency, while deterministic approaches may encounter
serious issues and risks of failure when faced with sudden and unexpected
maneuvers. To address these issues, we propose a real-time contingency
trajectory optimization framework in this paper. By employing event-triggered
online learning of HV control-intent sets, our method dynamically quantifies
multi-modal HV uncertainties and refines the forward reachable set (FRS)
incrementally. Crucially, we enforce invariant safety through FRS-based barrier
constraints that ensure safety without reliance on accurate trajectory
prediction of HVs. These constraints are embedded in contingency trajectory
optimization and solved efficiently through consensus alternative direction
method of multipliers (ADMM). The system continuously adapts to the
uncertainties in HV behaviors, preserving feasibility and safety without
resorting to excessive conservatism. High-fidelity simulations on highway and
urban scenarios, as well as a series of real-world experiments demonstrate
significant improvements in driving efficiency and passenger comfort while
maintaining safety under uncertainty. The project page is available at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This study introduces a deformable aerial robot with a hybrid morphing structure for safe, energy-efficient perching on humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Birds perch for interaction with humans and energy efficiency; replicating this in aerial robots can provide functional advancements.

Method: A hybrid morphing structure combining flexible arms and pneumatic actuators was developed, ensuring stability in flight and soft grasping when perching.

Result: The prototype demonstrated compliant human-perching maneuvers and flight recovery post-deformation, showcasing interaction and energy efficiency.

Conclusion: This innovative aerial robot is the first to achieve safe human perching, combining structural adaptability with flight stability.

Abstract: Birds in nature perform perching not only for rest but also for interaction
with human such as the relationship with falconers. Recently, researchers
achieve perching-capable aerial robots as a way to save energy, and deformable
structure demonstrate significant advantages in efficiency of perching and
compactness of configuration. However, ensuring flight stability remains
challenging for deformable aerial robots due to the difficulty of controlling
flexible arms. Furthermore, perching for human interaction requires high
compliance along with safety. Thus, this study aims to develop a deformable
aerial robot capable of perching on humans with high flexibility and grasping
ability. To overcome the challenges of stability of both flight and perching,
we propose a hybrid morphing structure that combines a unilateral flexible arm
and a pneumatic inflatable actuators. This design allows the robot's arms to
remain rigid during flight and soft while perching for more effective grasping.
We also develop a pneumatic control system that optimizes pressure regulation
while integrating shock absorption and adjustable grasping forces, enhancing
interaction capabilities and energy efficiency. Besides, we focus on the
structural characteristics of the unilateral flexible arm and identify
sufficient conditions under which standard quadrotor modeling and control
remain effective in terms of flight stability. Finally, the developed prototype
demonstrates the feasibility of compliant perching maneuvers on humans, as well
as the robust recovery even after arm deformation caused by thrust reductions
during flight. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to achieve
an aerial robot capable of perching on humans for interaction.

combines fine-grained modeling with structural stability. At the implementation
level, OmniMap identifies key challenges across different modalities and
introduces several innovations: adaptive camera modeling for motion blur and
exposure compensation, hybrid incremental representation with normal
constraints, and probabilistic fusion for robust instance-level understanding.
Extensive experiments show OmniMap's superior performance in rendering
fidelity, geometric accuracy, and zero-shot semantic segmentation compared to
state-of-the-art methods across diverse scenes. The framework's versatility is
further evidenced through a variety of downstream applications, including

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore ways to improve classification accuracy and computational efficiency for self-collision detection.

Method: Incorporates positional encoding into binary classification models and employs lightweight MLPs in low-dimensional feature spaces for collision detection.

Result: Positional encoding improves model accuracy and enables better learning of high-frequency variations, enhancing collision detection efficiency over geometric approaches.

Conclusion: Machine learning, combined with positional encoding, presents a promising and faster alternative to traditional geometric methods for self-collision detection.

Abstract: This manuscript investigates the integration of positional encoding -- a
technique widely used in computer graphics -- into the input vector of a binary
classification model for self-collision detection. The results demonstrate the
benefits of incorporating positional encoding, which enhances classification
accuracy by enabling the model to better capture high-frequency variations,
leading to a more detailed and precise representation of complex collision
patterns. The manuscript shows that machine learning-based techniques, such as
lightweight multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) operating in a low-dimensional

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a vision-driven cross-modal RL framework using SSD-Mamba2, which enables scalable and efficient end-to-end motion control by addressing compute-memory trade-offs and long-term dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome limitations of current RL controllers including compute-memory trade-offs, inefficiency, and struggles with long-horizon credit assignments.

Method: The method integrates SSD-Mamba2 layers for selective state-space updating, combining proprioceptive states and exteroceptive observations. Training employs curricula that randomize terrain and scene complexity with compact reward structures.

Result: The framework demonstrates superior performance in task return, safety, and sample efficiency across diverse scenarios, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines at similar compute budgets.

Conclusion: SSD-Mamba2 offers a hardware-efficient and scalable backbone for RL-based motion control, enhancing foresight and stability while addressing key limitations in existing methods.

Abstract: End-to-end reinforcement learning for motion control promises unified
perception-action policies that scale across embodiments and tasks, yet most
deployed controllers are either blind (proprioception-only) or rely on fusion
backbones with unfavorable compute-memory trade-offs. Recurrent controllers
struggle with long-horizon credit assignment, and Transformer-based fusion
incurs quadratic cost in token length, limiting temporal and spatial context.
We present a vision-driven cross-modal RL framework built on SSD-Mamba2, a
selective state-space backbone that applies state-space duality (SSD) to enable
both recurrent and convolutional scanning with hardware-aware streaming and
near-linear scaling. Proprioceptive states and exteroceptive observations
(e.g., depth tokens) are encoded into compact tokens and fused by stacked
SSD-Mamba2 layers. The selective state-space updates retain long-range
dependencies with markedly lower latency and memory use than quadratic
self-attention, enabling longer look-ahead, higher token resolution, and stable
training under limited compute. Policies are trained end-to-end under curricula
that randomize terrain and appearance and progressively increase scene
complexity. A compact, state-centric reward balances task progress, energy
efficiency, and safety. Across diverse motion-control scenarios, our approach
consistently surpasses strong state-of-the-art baselines in return, safety
(collisions and falls), and sample efficiency, while converging faster at the
same compute budget. These results suggest that SSD-Mamba2 provides a practical
fusion backbone for scalable, foresightful, and efficient end-to-end motion
control.

Conclusion: The kinematics-informed approach of RobKiNet enhances sampling efficiency, demonstrating effectiveness in both theoretical validation and practical robotic applications, including complex tasks like battery disassembly.

Abstract: In robots task and motion planning (TAMP), it is crucial to sample within the
robot's configuration space to meet task-level global constraints and enhance
the efficiency of subsequent motion planning. Due to the complexity of joint
configuration sampling under multi-level constraints, traditional methods often
lack efficiency. This paper introduces the principle of RobKiNet, a
kinematics-informed neural network, for end-to-end sampling within the
Continuous Feasible Set (CFS) under multiple constraints in configuration
space, establishing its Optimization Expectation Model. Comparisons with
traditional sampling and learning-based approaches reveal that RobKiNet's
kinematic knowledge infusion enhances training efficiency by ensuring stable
and accurate gradient optimization.Visualizations and quantitative analyses in
a 2-DOF space validate its theoretical efficiency, while its application on a
9-DOF autonomous mobile manipulator robot(AMMR) demonstrates superior
whole-body and decoupled control, excelling in battery disassembly tasks.
RobKiNet outperforms deep reinforcement learning with a training speed 74.29

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enhances exploration efficiency and ensures bandwidth efficiency for autonomous robot teams in large-scale scenarios.

Abstract: Efficient exploration of unknown environments is crucial for autonomous
robots, especially in confined and large-scale scenarios with limited
communication. To address this challenge, we propose a collaborative
exploration framework for a marsupial ground-aerial robot team that leverages
the complementary capabilities of both platforms. The framework employs a
graph-based path planning algorithm to guide exploration and deploy the aerial
robot in areas where its expected gain significantly exceeds that of the ground
robot, such as large open spaces or regions inaccessible to the ground
platform, thereby maximizing coverage and efficiency. To facilitate large-scale
spatial information sharing, we introduce a bandwidth-efficient, task-driven
map compression strategy. This method enables each robot to reconstruct
resolution-specific volumetric maps while preserving exploration-critical
details, even at high compression rates. By selectively compressing and sharing
key data, communication overhead is minimized, ensuring effective map
integration for collaborative path planning. Simulation and real-world
experiments validate the proposed approach, demonstrating its effectiveness in
improving exploration efficiency while significantly reducing data
transmission.

### [248] [Temporal Counterfactual Explanations of Behaviour Tree Decisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07674)
*Tamlin Love,Antonio Andriella,Guillem Alenyà*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study introduces a method that generates counterfactual explanations for robot decisions controlled by behavior trees, improving their transparency and understandability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots are increasingly deployed in various domains, necessitating methods to explain their decision-making to stakeholders for trust and understanding. There is a gap in generating causal, counterfactual explanations for the behavior of robots driven by behavior trees.

Method: The authors propose automatically constructing a causal model based on the structure of behavior trees and domain knowledge. This model is then queried and searched to create diverse counterfactual explanations in response to "why" questions.

Result: The proposed approach can correctly explain a range of behavior tree structures and states, allowing it to answer a variety of causal questions across different scenarios.

Conclusion: This work provides a framework for generating counterfactual explanations for robots using behavior trees, enhancing transparency and trustworthiness in robotic systems.

Abstract: Explainability is a critical tool in helping stakeholders understand robots.
In particular, the ability for robots to explain why they have made a
particular decision or behaved in a certain way is useful in this regard.
Behaviour trees are a popular framework for controlling the decision-making of
robots and other software systems, and thus a natural question to ask is
whether or not a system driven by a behaviour tree is capable of answering
"why" questions. While explainability for behaviour trees has seen some prior
attention, no existing methods are capable of generating causal, counterfactual
explanations which detail the reasons for robot decisions and behaviour.
Therefore, in this work, we introduce a novel approach which automatically
generates counterfactual explanations in response to contrastive "why"
questions. Our method achieves this by first automatically building a causal
model from the structure of the behaviour tree as well as domain knowledge
about the state and individual behaviour tree nodes. The resultant causal model
is then queried and searched to find a set of diverse counterfactual
explanations. We demonstrate that our approach is able to correctly explain the
behaviour of a wide range of behaviour tree structures and states. By being
able to answer a wide range of causal queries, our approach represents a step
towards more transparent, understandable and ultimately trustworthy robotic
systems.

### [249] [Robust Radar SLAM for Vehicle Parking Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07683)
*Luis Diener,Jens Kalkkuhl,Markus Enzweiler*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a radar-based SLAM method for centimeter-level ego-motion accuracy suitable for automated parking while addressing limitations of traditional approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated parking demands centimeter-level accuracy due to tight spaces and obstacles, but current methods using inertial-measurement units and wheel encoders involve costly and time-consuming calibration.

Method: The authors propose a radar-based SLAM approach that integrates robocentric fusion of feature positions and Doppler velocities, multi-radar support, and a feature-pruning strategy to improve reliability and accuracy.

Result: Experiments validate high-accuracy localization and enhanced robustness compared to state-of-the-art methods for automated parking scenarios.

Conclusion: The Doppler-augmented radar SLAM approach successfully offers robust and precise ego-motion estimation, meeting automated parking requirements and addressing drawbacks of traditional solutions.

Abstract: We address ego-motion estimation for automated parking, where
centimeter-level accuracy is crucial due to tight spaces and nearby obstacles.
Traditional methods using inertial-measurement units and wheel encoders require
calibration, making them costly and time-consuming. To overcome this, we
propose a radar-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) approach
that leverages the robustness of radar to adverse weather and support for
online calibration. Our robocentric formulation fuses feature positions and
Doppler velocities for robust data association and filter convergence. Key
contributions include a Doppler-augmented radar SLAM method, multi-radar
support and an information-based feature-pruning strategy. Experiments
demonstrate high-accuracy localization and improved robustness over
state-of-the-art methods, meeting the demands of automated parking.

*Muzaffar Habib,Adnan Maqsood,Adnan Fayyaz ud Din*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This study develops a reinforcement learning (RL)-based control framework to enhance quadcopter resilience following in-flight propeller failure, leveraging Dynamic Programming (DP) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the critical need for robust altitude-maintenance control strategies for quadcopters to protect hardware and payload during in-flight propeller failure.

Method: Two RL approaches (DP as model-based with convergence guarantees and DDPG as model-free for faster computation) are adapted to train controllers for handling large, continuous state-action spaces and achieving desired states post-propeller failure.

Result: In extensive MATLAB simulations with varied initial conditions, the modified RL-based controllers demonstrated robustness and viability for quadcopter failure scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed RL framework, including comparative analysis of DP and DDPG, shows potential for mission-critical applications in faulty aerial systems.

Abstract: This study presents a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-based control
framework aimed at enhancing the safety and robustness of the quadcopter, with
a specific focus on resilience to in-flight one propeller failure. Addressing
the critical need of a robust control strategy for maintaining a desired
altitude for the quadcopter to safe the hardware and the payload in physical
applications. The proposed framework investigates two RL methodologies Dynamic
Programming (DP) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), to overcome the
challenges posed by the rotor failure mechanism of the quadcopter. DP, a
model-based approach, is leveraged for its convergence guarantees, despite high
computational demands, whereas DDPG, a model-free technique, facilitates rapid
computation but with constraints on solution duration. The research challenge
arises from training RL algorithms on large dimensions and action domains. With
modifications to the existing DP and DDPG algorithms, the controllers were
trained not only to cater for large continuous state and action domain and also
achieve a desired state after an inflight propeller failure. To verify the
robustness of the proposed control framework, extensive simulations were
conducted in a MATLAB environment across various initial conditions and
underscoring its viability for mission-critical quadcopter applications. A
comparative analysis was performed between both RL algorithms and their
potential for applications in faulty aerial systems.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPERO, a UAV with advancements addressing stability and aerodynamic conflicts, enabling functional stop-rotor flight transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stop-rotor aircraft could achieve efficient VTOL and forward flight operations, ideal for certain missions, but are hindered by stability and aerodynamic challenges.

Method: The researchers created SPERO, incorporating novel design features like a flipping wing, active mechanisms, a multi-rotor system, and an advanced flight controller.

Result: SPERO successfully demonstrates a stable, two-way transition between VTOL and forward flight, overcoming previous barriers in stop-rotor aircraft.

Conclusion: SPERO establishes a framework showing stable bidirectional transitions are feasible, paving the way for practical applications of stop-rotor UAVs.

Abstract: Stop-rotor aircraft have long been proposed as the ideal vertical takeoff and
landing (VTOL) aircraft for missions with equal time spent in both flight
regimes, such as agricultural monitoring, search and rescue, and last-mile
delivery. Featuring a central lifting surface that rotates in VTOL to generate
vertical thrust and locks in forward flight to generate passive lift, the
stop-rotor offers the potential for high efficiency across both modes. However,
practical implementation has remained infeasible due to aerodynamic and
stability conflicts between flight modes. In this work, we present SPERO
(Stopped-Penta Rotor), a stop-rotor uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) featuring a
flipping and latching wing, an active center of pressure mechanism, thrust
vectored counterbalances, a five-rotor architecture, and an eleven-state
machine flight controller coordinating geometric and controller
reconfiguration. Furthermore, SPERO establishes a generalizable design and
control framework for stopped-rotor UAVs. Together, these innovations overcome
longstanding challenges in stop-rotor flight and enable the first stable,
bidirectional transition between VTOL and forward flight.

### [252] [Programmable Locking Cells (PLC) for Modular Robots with High Stiffness Tunability and Morphological Adaptability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07916)
*Jianshu Zhou,Wei Chen,Junda Huang,Boyuan Liang,Yunhui Liu,Masayoshi Tomizuka*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a modular unit, the Programmable Locking Cell (PLC), which achieves stiffness modulation using mechanical interlocking actuated by cable tension. It demonstrates adaptability for diverse robotic applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robotic systems require efficient stiffness modulation for diverse tasks in unstructured environments, but existing solutions lack modularity, scalability, and robustness under high loads.

Method: The PLC achieves stiffness modulation via tendon-driven mechanics with cable-actuated interlocking joints, enabling transitions between compliant and firm states. Two prototypes validate its functionality: a gripper and a pipe-traversing robot.

Result: The PLC demonstrates high stiffness variation (up to 950% per unit), damage resistance under high payload, adaptive grasping, firm holding, in-hand manipulation, and shape adaptability.

Conclusion: The PLC is a scalable mechanism for programmable stiffness modulation and reconfigurable robotic morphology, enhancing adaptability to tasks and environments.

Abstract: Robotic systems operating in unstructured environments require the ability to
switch between compliant and rigid states to perform diverse tasks such as
adaptive grasping, high-force manipulation, shape holding, and navigation in
constrained spaces, among others. However, many existing variable stiffness
solutions rely on complex actuation schemes, continuous input power, or
monolithic designs, limiting their modularity and scalability. This paper
presents the Programmable Locking Cell (PLC)-a modular, tendon-driven unit that
achieves discrete stiffness modulation through mechanically interlocked joints
actuated by cable tension. Each unit transitions between compliant and firm
states via structural engagement, and the assembled system exhibits high
stiffness variation-up to 950% per unit-without susceptibility to damage under
high payload in the firm state. Multiple PLC units can be assembled into
reconfigurable robotic structures with spatially programmable stiffness. We
validate the design through two functional prototypes: (1) a variable-stiffness
gripper capable of adaptive grasping, firm holding, and in-hand manipulation;
and (2) a pipe-traversing robot composed of serial PLC units that achieves
shape adaptability and stiffness control in confined environments. These
results demonstrate the PLC as a scalable, structure-centric mechanism for
programmable stiffness and motion, enabling robotic systems with reconfigurable
morphology and task-adaptive interaction.

### [253] [RaC: Robot Learning for Long-Horizon Tasks by Scaling Recovery and Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07953)
*Zheyuan Hu,Robyn Wu,Naveen Enock,Jasmine Li,Riya Kadakia,Zackory Erickson,Aviral Kumar*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RaC enhances robotic imitation learning by incorporating recovery maneuvers during training using human-in-the-loop interventions, reducing data requirements and improving performance in complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inefficiency in robot imitation learning for complex tasks by introducing a method to leverage human interventions during rollouts.

Method: RaC trains robotic policies with human interventions that rewind the robot to an in-distribution state and illustrate corrective behaviors during task failure.

Result: RaC outperforms previous techniques in long-horizon manipulations while requiring significantly less data, demonstrating scalability in recovery maneuvers.

Conclusion: RaC represents a robust approach to expand robotic skillsets, enabling retries and adaptations while significantly optimizing data utilization in imitation learning.

Abstract: Modern paradigms for robot imitation train expressive policy architectures on
large amounts of human demonstration data. Yet performance on contact-rich,
deformable-object, and long-horizon tasks plateau far below perfect execution,
even with thousands of expert demonstrations. This is due to the inefficiency
of existing ``expert'' data collection procedures based on human teleoperation.
To address this issue, we introduce RaC, a new phase of training on
human-in-the-loop rollouts after imitation learning pre-training. In RaC, we
fine-tune a robotic policy on human intervention trajectories that illustrate
recovery and correction behaviors. Specifically, during a policy rollout, human
operators intervene when failure appears imminent, first rewinding the robot
back to a familiar, in-distribution state and then providing a corrective
segment that completes the current sub-task. Training on this data composition
expands the robotic skill repertoire to include retry and adaptation behaviors,
which we show are crucial for boosting both efficiency and robustness on
long-horizon tasks. Across three real-world bimanual control tasks: shirt
hanging, airtight container lid sealing, takeout box packing, and a simulated
assembly task, RaC outperforms the prior state-of-the-art using 10$\times$ less
data collection time and samples. We also show that RaC enables test-time
scaling: the performance of the trained RaC policy scales linearly in the
number of recovery maneuvers it exhibits. Videos of the learned policy are
available at https://rac-scaling-robot.github.io/.

*Shunlei Li,Longsen Gao,Jiuwen Cao,Yingbai Hu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces GF-VLA, a framework for dual-arm robots learning dexterous skills from human videos by using scene graphs and language-conditioned planning for task reasoning and execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations in robotic skill acquisition by overcoming the generalization challenges in trajectory replication methods.

Method: The GF-VLA framework extracts task-relevant cues from RGB-D data to create temporally ordered scene graphs, integrates them with language-conditioned transformers, and generates behavior trees for task execution with efficient cross-arm allocation.

Result: Empirical validations show high graph accuracy (95%), subtask segmentation (93%), and robust task success rates (~90%) on tests involving stacking and geometric reconfiguration.

Conclusion: GF-VLA demonstrates strong generalization and robustness, enabling dual-arm robots to achieve interpretability and high success in diverse tasks.

Abstract: Acquiring dexterous robotic skills from human video demonstrations remains a
significant challenge, largely due to conventional reliance on low-level
trajectory replication, which often fails to generalize across varying objects,
spatial layouts, and manipulator configurations. To address this limitation, we
introduce Graph-Fused Vision-Language-Action (GF-VLA), a unified framework that
enables dual-arm robotic systems to perform task-level reasoning and execution
directly from RGB-D human demonstrations. GF-VLA employs an
information-theoretic approach to extract task-relevant cues, selectively
highlighting critical hand-object and object-object interactions. These cues
are structured into temporally ordered scene graphs, which are subsequently
integrated with a language-conditioned transformer to produce hierarchical
behavior trees and interpretable Cartesian motion primitives. To enhance
efficiency in bimanual execution, we propose a cross-arm allocation strategy
that autonomously determines gripper assignment without requiring explicit
geometric modeling. We validate GF-VLA on four dual-arm block assembly
benchmarks involving symbolic structure construction and spatial
generalization. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed representation
achieves over 95% graph accuracy and 93% subtask segmentation, enabling the
language-action planner to generate robust, interpretable task policies. When
deployed on a dual-arm robot, these policies attain 94% grasp reliability, 89%
placement accuracy, and 90% overall task success across stacking,
letter-formation, and geometric reconfiguration tasks, evidencing strong
generalization and robustness under diverse spatial and semantic variations.

*Zongzheng Zhang,Haobo Xu,Zhuo Yang,Chenghao Yue,Zehao Lin,Huan-ang Gao,Ziwei Wang,Hao Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Torque-aware Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models to improve robotic manipulation by integrating torque signals, enhancing performance in contact-rich tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language-Action models lack the ability to use physical feedback like torque signals, which is crucial for assessing task success and enabling closed-loop control.

Method: The study evaluates strategies for incorporating torque signals into VLA architectures, including using torque adapters in the decoder and auxiliary torque prediction to strengthen physical interaction understanding.

Result: The inclusion of torque adapters in the decoder improves performance consistently, and auxiliary torque prediction enhances the model's ability to physically ground interaction dynamics.

Conclusion: Integrating torque signals into VLA models allows robots to handle contact-rich manipulation tasks more effectively, as demonstrated through extensive benchmarks.

Abstract: Many robotic manipulation tasks require sensing and responding to force
signals such as torque to assess whether the task has been successfully
completed and to enable closed-loop control. However, current
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models lack the ability to integrate such subtle
physical feedback. In this work, we explore Torque-aware VLA models, aiming to
bridge this gap by systematically studying the design space for incorporating
torque signals into existing VLA architectures. We identify and evaluate
several strategies, leading to three key findings. First, introducing torque
adapters into the decoder consistently outperforms inserting them into the
encoder.Third, inspired by joint prediction and planning paradigms in
autonomous driving, we propose predicting torque as an auxiliary output, which
further improves performance. This strategy encourages the model to build a
physically grounded internal representation of interaction dynamics. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative experiments across contact-rich manipulation
benchmarks validate our findings.

*Mterorga Ukor*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper explores using Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) to improve modularity, maintainability, and reusability of security features in web applications, with minimal performance trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Security in web applications remains challenging due to threats like unauthorized access and code complexity caused by mixing security and business logic in traditional Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

Method: The study compares AOP-based implementations of security mechanisms with OOP and middleware methods using a case-study approach, analyzing code quality metrics, performance, maintainability, and developer experiences.

Result: AOP-based implementations demonstrate improvements in modularity, reusability, and maintainability of security concerns while maintaining negligible performance overhead.

Conclusion: AOP is effective in separating security logic from business functionality, providing practical insights for improving software quality and security in web development.

Abstract: Security remains a critical challenge in modern web applications, where
threats such as unauthorized access, data breaches, and injection attacks
continue to undermine trust and reliability. Traditional Object-Oriented
Programming (OOP) often intertwines security logic with business functionality,
leading to code tangling, scattering, and reduced maintainability. This study
investigates the role of Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) in enhancing secure
software development by modularizing cross-cutting security concerns. Using a
case study approach, we compare AOP-based implementations of security features
including authentication, authorization, input validation, encryption, logging,
and session management with conventional OOP or middleware-based approaches.
Data collection involves analyzing code quality metrics (e.g., lines of code,
coupling, cohesion, modularity index, reusability), performance metrics
(response time, throughput, memory usage), and maintainability indicators.
Developer feedback is also incorporated to assess integration and debugging
experiences. Statistical methods, guided by the ISO/IEC 25010 software quality
model, are applied to evaluate differences across implementations. The findings
demonstrate that AOP enhances modularity, reusability, and maintainability of
security mechanisms, while introducing only minimal performance overhead. The
study contributes practical insights for software engineers and researchers
seeking to balance security with software quality in web application
development.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces CRACI, a Cloud-native Reference Architecture designed to overcome the limitations of traditional industrial architectures by enabling scalable and interoperable systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The convergence of IT and OT in Industry 4.0 highlights the inefficiencies of rigid, hierarchical architectures such as ISA-95 and RAMI 4.0, which obstruct scalability and cloud-native technology adoption.

Method: The CRACI architecture is developed to decouple operations and ensure event-driven data flow. Its design incorporates cross-cutting concerns like Trust, Governance, Observability, and Lifecycle Management. Validation is performed both through theoretical comparisons and quantitative data from smart manufacturing examples.

Result: The results indicate that CRACI outperforms legacy systems in overcoming architectural shortcomings, utilizing the compute continuum effectively, and enabling modern industrial scalability.

Conclusion: CRACI offers a cloud-native solution to address the rigid and siloed nature of legacy industrial frameworks while maintaining essential quality attributes for scalable and interoperable systems.

Abstract: The convergence of Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology
(OT) in Industry 4.0 exposes the limitations of traditional, hierarchical
architectures like ISA-95 and RAMI 4.0. Their inherent rigidity, data silos,
and lack of support for cloud-native technologies impair the development of
scalable and interoperable industrial systems. This paper addresses this issue
by introducing CRACI, a Cloud-native Reference Architecture for the Industrial
Compute Continuum. Among other features, CRACI promotes a decoupled and
event-driven model to enable flexible, non-hierarchical data flows across the
continuum. It embeds cross-cutting concerns as foundational pillars: Trust,
Governance & Policy, Observability, and Lifecycle Management, ensuring quality
attributes are core to the design. The proposed architecture is validated
through a two-fold approach: (1) a comparative theoretical analysis against
established standards, operational models, and academic proposals; and (2) a
quantitative evaluation based on performance data from previously published
real-world smart manufacturing implementations. The results demonstrate that
CRACI provides a viable, state-of-the-art architecture that utilizes the
compute continuum to overcome the structural limitations of legacy models and
enable scalable, modern industrial systems.

### [258] [PatchSeeker: Mapping NVD Records to their Vulnerability-fixing Commits with LLM Generated Commits and Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07540)
*Huu Hung Nguyen,Anh Tuan Nguyen,Thanh Le-Cong,Yikun Li,Han Wei Ang,Yide Yin,Frank Liauw,Shar Lwin Khin,Ouh Eng Lieh,Ting Zhang,David Lo*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: PatchSeeker is a novel approach leveraging large language models for matching vulnerability descriptions in the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) to precise Vulnerability-Fixing Commits (VFCs), outperforming current methods significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of explicit links between NVD records and VFCs limits the ability to localize vulnerabilities, analyze patches, and construct datasets. Existing methods, relying on sparse commit messages, fail to capture the deep semantics of vulnerability descriptions.

Method: PatchSeeker uses large language models to generate embeddings for NVD descriptions and creates enhanced commit messages by synthesizing detailed summaries, bridging the gap between natural language reports and code changes. This creates semantic links between the records and VCCs.

Result: PatchSeeker demonstrated 59.3% higher MRR and 27.9% higher Recall@10 compared to Prospector, the best-performing baseline, on benchmarks. Its effectiveness was further validated with recent CVEs and supported by ablation studies showing the contribution of synthesized messages and LLMs.

Conclusion: PatchSeeker proves to be significantly effective in mapping vulnerabilities to their fixes using enhanced semantic links. The results suggest its potential for improving current practices while highlighting areas for further research.

Abstract: Software vulnerabilities pose serious risks to modern software ecosystems.
While the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) is the authoritative source for
cataloging these vulnerabilities, it often lacks explicit links to the
corresponding Vulnerability-Fixing Commits (VFCs). VFCs encode precise code
changes, enabling vulnerability localization, patch analysis, and dataset
construction. Automatically mapping NVD records to their true VFCs is therefore
critical. Existing approaches have limitations as they rely on sparse, often
noisy commit messages and fail to capture the deep semantics in the
vulnerability descriptions. To address this gap, we introduce PatchSeeker, a
novel method that leverages large language models to create rich semantic links
between vulnerability descriptions and their VFCs. PatchSeeker generates
embeddings from NVD descriptions and enhances commit messages by synthesizing
detailed summaries for those that are short or uninformative. These generated
messages act as a semantic bridge, effectively closing the information gap
between natural language reports and low-level code changes. Our approach
PatchSeeker achieves 59.3% higher MRR and 27.9% higher Recall@10 than the
best-performing baseline, Prospector, on the benchmark dataset. The extended
evaluation on recent CVEs further confirms PatchSeeker's effectiveness.
Ablation study shows that both the commit message generation method and the
selection of backbone LLMs make a positive contribution to PatchSeeker. We also
discuss limitations and open challenges to guide future work.

### [259] [Bridging the Gap Between Binary and Source Based Package Management in Spack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07728)
*John Gouwar,Gregory Becker,Tamara Dahlgren,Nathan Hanford,Arjun Guha,Todd Gamblin*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper presents splicing, an enhancement to the Spack package manager, combining source and binary package uses while ensuring binary compatibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Binary package managers are quick but lack configurability, while source managers are flexible but slow. Spack combines both but cannot mix independently-built binaries, limiting broader compatibility.

Method: Splicing extends Spack's language and dependency engine to support binary compatibility modeling, enabling seamless integration of source and binary packages.

Result: The extended system maintains minimal installation overhead while allowing efficient and flexible installations, including for ABI-sensitive dependencies like MPI.

Conclusion: Splicing enhances Spack's utility by balancing the speed of binary packages with the configurability of source builds, solving ABI rigidity issues.

Abstract: Binary package managers install software quickly but they limit
configurability due to rigid ABI requirements that ensure compatibility between
binaries. Source package managers provide flexibility in building software, but
compilation can be slow. For example, installing an HPC code with a new MPI
implementation may result in a full rebuild. Spack, a widely deployed,
HPC-focused package manager, can use source and pre-compiled binaries, but
lacks a binary compatibility model, so it cannot mix binaries not built
together. We present splicing, an extension to Spack that models binary
compatibility between packages and allows seamless mixing of source and binary
distributions. Splicing augments Spack's packaging language and dependency
resolution engine to reuse compatible binaries but maintains the flexibility of
source builds. It incurs minimal installation-time overhead and allows rapid
installation from binaries, even for ABI-sensitive dependencies like MPI that
would otherwise require many rebuilds.

*Mikel Robredo,Matteo Esposito,Fabio Palomba,Rafael Peñaloza,Valentina Lenarduzzi*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper investigates developers' motivations for refactoring using Large Language Models (LLMs) and software metrics, highlighting strengths and limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Refactoring is essential for software quality but often hindered by high costs. Understanding developers' motivations may optimize its application.

Method: Conducted a large-scale empirical study using LLMs to analyze motivations behind refactoring, comparing findings with existing literature.

Result: LLMs agreed with human judgment in 80% of cases, enriched motivations with detailed rationale, but had limited alignment with literature-based motivations.

Conclusion: LLMs offer localized motivation insights but struggle with architectural reasoning. A hybrid approach combining LLM insights and metrics may optimize refactoring prioritization.

Abstract: Context. Code refactoring improves software quality without changing external
behavior. Despite its advantages, its benefits are hindered by the considerable
cost of time, resources, and continuous effort it demands. Aim. Understanding
why developers refactor, and which metrics capture these motivations, may
support wider and more effective use of refactoring in practice. Method. We
performed a large-scale empirical study to analyze developers refactoring
activity, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify underlying
motivations from version control data, comparing our findings with previous
motivations reported in the literature. Results. LLMs matched human judgment in
80% of cases, but aligned with literature-based motivations in only 47%. They
enriched 22% of motivations with more detailed rationale, often highlighting
readability, clarity, and structural improvements. Most motivations were
pragmatic, focused on simplification and maintainability. While metrics related
to developer experience and code readability ranked highest, their correlation
with motivation categories was weak. Conclusions. We conclude that LLMs
effectively capture surface-level motivations but struggle with architectural
reasoning. Their value lies in providing localized explanations, which, when
combined with software metrics, can form hybrid approaches. Such integration
offers a promising path toward prioritizing refactoring more systematically and
balancing short-term improvements with long-term architectural goals.

*Maksym Avramenko,David Chapela-Campa,Marlon Dumas,Fredrik Milani*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes a short-term business process simulation approach starting from the current state, derived from event logs, to yield more accurate operational decision-making forecasts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing business process simulations mainly support long-term tactical decisions but lack tools for precise short-term forecasting relevant to operational decision-making.

Method: The paper introduces a simulation engine that initializes from a current state representation, derived from event logs, rather than relying on warm-up from long-term simulations.

Result: The experimental evaluation demonstrates improved short-term forecasting accuracy, especially in scenarios with concept drift or irregular performance fluctuations.

Conclusion: Short-term business process simulation based on current state initialization results in better operational insights and decision-making than traditional long-term approaches with warm-up periods.

Abstract: Business process simulation is an approach to evaluate business process
changes prior to implementation. Existing methods in this field primarily
support tactical decision-making, where simulations start from an empty state
and aim to estimate the long-term effects of process changes. A complementary
use-case is operational decision-making, where the goal is to forecast
short-term performance based on ongoing cases and to analyze the impact of
temporary disruptions, such as demand spikes and shortfalls in available
resources. An approach to tackle this use-case is to run a long-term simulation
up to a point where the workload is similar to the current one (warm-up), and
measure performance thereon. However, this approach does not consider the
current state of ongoing cases and resources in the process. This paper studies
an alternative approach that initializes the simulation from a representation
of the current state derived from an event log of ongoing cases. The paper
addresses two challenges in operationalizing this approach: (1) Given a
simulation model, what information is needed so that a simulation run can start
from the current state of cases and resources? (2) How can the current state of
a process be derived from an event log? The resulting short-term simulation
approach is embodied in a simulation engine that takes as input a simulation
model and a log of ongoing cases, and simulates cases for a given time horizon.
An experimental evaluation shows that this approach yields more accurate
short-term performance forecasts than long-term simulations with warm-up
period, particularly in the presence of concept drift or bursty performance
patterns.

### [262] ["We provide our resources in a dedicated repository": Surveying the Transparency of HICSS publications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07851)
*Irdin Pekaric,Giovanni Apruzzese*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the extent to which research papers from HICSS provide supplementary material in external repositories, finding that only 3% of papers include usable repositories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for transparency and reproducibility in research by analyzing if researchers make supplementary resources available via external repositories.

Method: The authors collect and analyze 5,579 papers from HICSS proceedings (2017–2024), focusing on 850 papers involving human subjects, 737 papers with technical implementations, and 147 covering both. They examine these papers for links to external repositories and assess usability.

Result: Out of 2,028 specific papers reviewed, only 3% had functional, publicly available repositories usable for downstream research.

Conclusion: The findings highlight a significant gap in research transparency and reproducibility, signaling the need for improved practices in sharing supplementary materials.

Abstract: Every day, new discoveries are made by researchers from all across the globe
and fields. HICSS is a flagship venue to present and discuss such scientific
advances. Yet, the activities carried out for any given research can hardly be
fully contained in a single document of a few pages-the "paper." Indeed, any
given study entails data, artifacts, or other material that is crucial to truly
appreciate the contributions claimed in the corresponding paper. External
repositories (e.g., GitHub) are a convenient tool to store all such resources
so that future work can freely observe and build upon them -- thereby improving
transparency and promoting reproducibility of research as a whole. In this
work, we scrutinize the extent to which papers recently accepted to HICSS
leverage such repositories to provide supplementary material. To this end, we
collect all the 5579 papers included in HICSS proceedings from 2017-2024. Then,
we identify those entailing either human subject research (850) or technical
implementations (737), or both (147). Finally, we review their text, examining
how many include a link to an external repository-and, inspect its contents.
Overall, out of 2028 papers, only 3\% have a functional and publicly available
repository that is usable by downstream research. We release all our tools.

### [263] [Breaking Android with AI: A Deep Dive into LLM-Powered Exploitation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07933)
*Wanni Vidulige Ishan Perera,Xing Liu,Fan liang,Junyi Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study examines the use of LLM-based tools like PentestGPT for automating Android penetration testing, comparing it with traditional methods, and exploring its strengths, limitations, and ethical implications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advancement of AI and LLMs presents opportunities to enhance cybersecurity processes like penetration testing by automating tasks that traditionally require manual intervention.

Method: The study uses an Android emulator (Genymotion) as a testbed for comparing traditional manual rooting techniques with AI-generated exploits facilitated by OpenAI's API and PentestGPT. A web application is also developed to automate script generation from LLM responses.

Result: The findings highlight that AI-based exploitation significantly streamlines penetration testing, but it still requires human oversight to ensure accuracy and prevent ethical misuse.

Conclusion: LLM-based tools like PentestGPT provide promising enhancements in cybersecurity automation, but their application needs careful human control to maintain ethical and accurate usage.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models
(LLMs) has opened up new opportunities in the area of cybersecurity, especially
in the exploitation automation landscape and penetration testing. This study
explores Android penetration testing automation using LLM-based tools,
especially PentestGPT, to identify and execute rooting techniques. Through a
comparison of the traditional manual rooting process and exploitation methods
produced using AI, this study evaluates the efficacy, reliability, and
scalability of automated penetration testing in achieving high-level privilege
access on Android devices. With the use of an Android emulator (Genymotion) as
the testbed, we fully execute both traditional and exploit-based rooting
methods, automating the process using AI-generated scripts. Secondly, we create
a web application by integrating OpenAI's API to facilitate automated script
generation from LLM-processed responses. The research focuses on the
effectiveness of AI-enabled exploitation by comparing automated and manual
penetration testing protocols, by determining LLM weaknesses and strengths
along the way. We also provide security suggestions of AI-enabled exploitation,
including ethical factors and potential misuse. The findings exhibit that while
LLMs can significantly streamline the workflow of exploitation, they need to be
controlled by humans to ensure accuracy and ethical application. This study
adds to the increasing body of literature on AI-powered cybersecurity and its
effect on ethical hacking, security research, and mobile device security.

### [264] [Association of Timing and Duration of Moderate-to-Vigorous Physical Activity with Cognitive Function and Brain Aging: A Population-Based Study Using the UK Biobank](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06969)
*Wasif Khan,Lin Gu,Noah Hammarlund,Lei Xing,Joshua K. Wong,Ruogu Fang*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: Higher moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) is linked to improved cognitive function and preserved brain structure in older adults, with benefits observed across various times of the day and brain regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper aims to clarify the poorly understood relationship between the intensity and timing of MVPA and their impacts on cognitive function and specific brain regions in older adults.

Method: The study analyzed data from 45,892 UK Biobank participants over 60 years old using accelerometer data, cognitive tests, and brain MRI scans. Associations were evaluated using linear models that accounted for covariates like socioeconomic and health factors.

Result: Higher MVPA correlated with improved cognition (reasoning, memory, executive function, and processing speed) and greater volume in specific subcortical and gray matter brain regions. Timing analyses indicated benefits at any time, particularly midday-afternoon and evening.

Conclusion: Engaging in MVPA supports brain health and cognitive function in later life, highlighting its potential as part of public health strategies to promote healthy aging and generate economic benefits globally.

Abstract: Physical activity is a modifiable lifestyle factor with potential to support
cognitive resilience. However, the association of moderate-to-vigorous physical
activity (MVPA) intensity, and timing, with cognitive function and
region-specific brain structure remain poorly understood. We analyzed data from
45,892 UK Biobank participants aged 60 years and older with valid wrist-worn
accelerometer data, cognitive testing, and structural brain MRI. MVPA was
measured both continuously (mins per week) and categorically (thresholded using
>=150 min/week based on WHO guidelines). Associations with cognitive
performance and regional brain volumes were evaluated using multivariable
linear models adjusted for demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related
covariates. We conducted secondary analyses on MVPA timing and subgroup
effects. Higher MVPA was associated with better performance across cognitive
domains, including reasoning, memory, executive function, and processing speed.
These associations persisted in fully adjusted models and were higher among
participants meeting WHO guidelines. Greater MVPA was also associated with
subcortical brain regions (caudate, putamen, pallidum, thalamus), as well as
regional gray matter volumes involved in emotion, working memory, and
perceptual processing. Secondary analyses showed that MVPA at any time of day
was associated with cognitive functions and brain volume particularly in the
midday-afternoon and evening. Sensitivity analysis shows consistent findings
across subgroups, with evidence of dose-response relationships. Higher MVPA is
associated with preserved brain structure and enhanced cognitive function in
later life. Public health strategies to increase MVPA may support healthy
cognitive aging and generate substantial economic benefits, with global gains
projected to reach USD 760 billion annually by 2050.

*Zofia Rudnicka,Janusz Szczepanski,Agnieszka Pregowska*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This study examines how neuron models and learning rules affect the performance of Spiking Neural Networks in bio-signal processing and introduces a complexity-driven evaluation method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to systematically evaluate the influence of distinct neuron models and learning rules on the performance of Spiking Neural Networks, particularly in bio-signal processing applications, while addressing the need for a consistent evaluation benchmark.

Method: The study compares various neuron models (LIF, metaneurons, and LB neurons) and learning rules (STDP, tempotron, reward-modulated updates) while introducing a complexity-based evaluation using Lempel-Ziv Complexity (LZC). Synthetic datasets with temporal dependencies and stochasticity levels (Markov and Poisson processes) are used to assess performance.

Result: Classification outcomes depend on the interaction of neuron models, learning rules, and network sizes. The complexity-based evaluation reveals robust configurations even under weak or noisy signals.

Conclusion: The paper provides comprehensive insights into the performance of Spiking Neural Networks, highlighting the importance of neuron model selection and introducing an LZC-based evaluation as a reliable benchmark.

Abstract: This study explores how the selection of neuron models and learning rules
impacts the classification performance of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), with
a focus on applications in bio-signal processing. We compare biologically
inspired neuron models, including Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF), metaneurons,
and probabilistic Levy-Baxter (LB) neurons, across multiple learning rules,
including spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), tempotron, and
reward-modulated updates. A novel element of this work is the integration of a
complexity-based decision mechanism into the evaluation pipeline. Using
Lempel-Ziv Complexity (LZC), a measure related to entropy rate, we quantify the
structural regularity of spike trains and assess classification outcomes in a
consistent and interpretable manner across different SNN configurations. To
investigate neural dynamics and assess algorithm performance, we employed
synthetic datasets with varying temporal dependencies and stochasticity levels.
These included Markov and Poisson processes, well-established models to
simulate neuronal spike trains and capture the stochastic firing behavior of
biological neurons.Validation of synthetic Poisson and Markov-modeled data
reveals clear performance trends: classification accuracy depends on the
interaction between neuron model, network size, and learning rule, with the
LZC-based evaluation highlighting configurations that remain robust to weak or
noisy signals. This work delivers a systematic analysis of how neuron model
selection interacts with network parameters and learning strategies, supported
by a novel complexity-based evaluation approach that offers a consistent
benchmark for SNN performance.

### [266] [Artificial Intelligence as an Opportunity for the Science of Consciousness: A Dual-Resolution Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07001)
*Shahar Dror,Dafna Bergerbest,Moti Salti*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper discusses how consciousness research can advance AI understanding by addressing current polarized theories through a dual-resolution framework, offering a generalizable view and using AI as a testbed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to bridge the polarized views on consciousness—computational functionalism and biological naturalism—and expand consciousness theories to include non-biological systems like AI.

Method: The study introduces a dual-resolution framework combining the Information Theory of Individuality and the Moment-to-Moment theory to define conditions for consciousness in terms of informational autonomy and temporal unfolding.

Result: The authors present a substrate-independent, generalizable theory of consciousness, reframing it as the epistemic expression of individuated systems and proposing AI as a crucial experimental domain.

Conclusion: The dual-resolution framework allows for recognizing non-biological forms of subjectivity, broadens the scope of consciousness research, and positions AI as integral to testing these new ideas.

Abstract: The encounter of artificial intelligence with consciousness research is often
framed as a challenge: could this science determine whether such systems are
conscious? We suggest it is equally an opportunity to expand and test the scope
of existing theories of consciousness. Current approaches remain polarized.
Computational functionalism emphasizes abstract organization, often realized
through neural correlates of consciousness, while biological naturalism insists
that consciousness is tied to living embodiment. Both positions risk
anthropocentrism and limit the possibility of recognizing non-biological forms
of subjectivity. To move beyond this impasse, we propose a dual-resolution
framework that defines the ontological and epistemic conditions for
consciousness. This approach combines the Information Theory of Individuality,
which defines the ontological conditions of informational autonomy and
self-maintenance, with the Moment-to-Moment theory, which specifies the
epistemic conditions of temporal updating and phenomenological unfolding. This
integration reframes consciousness as the epistemic expression of individuated
systems in substrate-independent informational terms, offering a generalizable
theory of consciousness and positioning AI as a promising testbed for its
emergence.

*Anton Kolonin,Vladimir Kryukov*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper proposes a cognitive architecture and computational formalization for creating artificial intelligence, emphasizing decision-making under needs and uncertainties, and offers an experimental implementation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of building general artificial intelligence that can make optimal decisions based on agent-specific needs under uncertainty.

Method: Introduces a cognitive architecture conceptualizing the human psyche as an operating system, including a needs-based framework for decision-making, and formalizes it using computational models.

Result: Developed a computational approach for artificial intelligence that learns from experience by prioritizing existentially significant needs, and demonstrated this through a minimal experimental implementation.

Conclusion: The paper lays foundational work for advancing general artificial intelligence, focusing on needs-based decision-making, success maximization, risk minimization, and energy efficiency.

Abstract: The article provides an overview of approaches to modeling the human psyche
in the perspective of building an artificial one. Based on the review, a
concept of cognitive architecture is proposed, where the psyche is considered
as an operating system of a living or artificial subject, including a space of
needs that determines its life meanings in connection with stimuli from the
external world, and intelligence as a decision-making system for actions in
relation to this world in order to satisfy these needs. Based on the concept, a
computational formalization is proposed for creating artificial intelligence
systems through learning from experience in the space of a space of needs,
taking into account their biological or existential significance for an
intelligent agent. Thus, the problem of building general artificial
intelligence as a system for making optimal decisions in the space of
agent-specific needs under conditions of uncertainty is formalized, with
maximization of success in achieving goals, minimization of existential risks
and maximization of energy efficiency. A minimal experimental implementation of
the model is also provided.

*Nida Alyas,Jonathan Horsley,Peter N. Taylor,Yujiang Wang,Karoline Leiberg*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper reviews normative modelling in neuroimaging, highlights its strengths and limitations, and provides guidance for clinical researchers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in implementing normative modelling in neuroimaging and provide practical, responsible usage guidelines.

Method: The authors offer a review and practical example using clinical epilepsy data, comparing open-source tools and discussing implementation considerations.

Result: Insights into decision-making, pitfalls, and responsible application of normative modelling in neuroimaging research were provided.

Conclusion: Normative modelling is a valuable tool in neuroimaging, but its implementation requires careful consideration of statistical and practical factors.

Abstract: Normative modelling is an increasingly common statistical technique in
neuroimaging that estimates population-level benchmarks in brain structure. It
enables the quantification of individual deviations from expected distributions
whilst accounting for biological and technical covariates without requiring
large, matched control groups. This makes it a powerful alternative to
traditional case-control studies for identifying brain structural alterations
associated with pathology. Despite the availability of numerous modelling
approaches and several toolboxes with pretrained models, the distinct strengths
and limitations of normative modelling make it difficult to determine how and
when to implement them appropriately. This review offers practical guidance and
outlines statistical considerations for clinical researchers using normative
modelling in neuroimaging. We compare several open-source normative modelling
tools through a worked example using clinical epilepsy data; outlining decision
points, common pitfalls, and considerations for responsible implementation, to
support broader and more rigorous adoption of normative modelling in
neuroimaging research.

*Mert Ketenci,Vincent Jeanselme,Harry Reyes Nieva,Shalmali Joshi,Noémie Elhadad*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Proposed ADHAM, an interpretable additive survival model for healthcare time-to-event predictions, with comparable predictive performance and enhanced interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of interpretability in neural network-based survival analysis models for healthcare, impeding clinical decision-making.

Method: Developed ADHAM, an additive survival model with a conditional latent subgroup structure and post-training refinement to merge similar subgroups.

Result: ADHAM achieves interpretability at population, subgroup, and individual levels, providing novel exposure-outcome insights and competing with state-of-the-art survival models in performance.

Conclusion: ADHAM offers a scalable, interpretable, and effective approach for survival analysis in healthcare, resolving prior challenges of interpretability.

Abstract: Survival analysis is a fundamental tool for modeling time-to-event outcomes
in healthcare. Recent advances have introduced flexible neural network
approaches for improved predictive performance. However, most of these models
do not provide interpretable insights into the association between exposures
and the modeled outcomes, a critical requirement for decision-making in
clinical practice. To address this limitation, we propose Additive Deep Hazard
Analysis Mixtures (ADHAM), an interpretable additive survival model. ADHAM
assumes a conditional latent structure that defines subgroups, each
characterized by a combination of covariate-specific hazard functions. To
select the number of subgroups, we introduce a post-training refinement that
reduces the number of equivalent latent subgroups by merging similar groups. We
perform comprehensive studies to demonstrate ADHAM's interpretability at the
population, subgroup, and individual levels. Extensive experiments on
real-world datasets show that ADHAM provides novel insights into the
association between exposures and outcomes. Further, ADHAM remains on par with
existing state-of-the-art survival baselines in terms of predictive
performance, offering a scalable and interpretable approach to time-to-event
prediction in healthcare.

### [270] [NestGNN: A Graph Neural Network Framework Generalizing the Nested Logit Model for Travel Mode Choice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07123)
*Yuqi Zhou,Zhanhong Cheng,Lingqian Hu,Yuheng Bu,Shenhao Wang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel Nested-Utility Graph Neural Network (NestGNN) to extend classical Nested Logit (NL) models for discrete choice analysis, addressing their limitations in capturing inter-alternative correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical NL models lack flexibility and are limited in representing inter-alternative correlations explicitly, limiting their application in discrete choice problems.

Method: The authors propose 'alternative graphs' to represent relationships among travel modes. They design NestGNN, which generalizes NL models in the neural network family while retaining NL's substitution patterns.

Result: Empirical experiments show NestGNN significantly outperforms benchmark models, specifically improving results over NL models by 9.2%. It preserves NL's substitution patterns while offering more flexibility.

Conclusion: NestGNN demonstrates enhanced prediction accuracy, interpretability, and flexibility in modeling discrete choices, showing its potential to generalize traditional NL models effectively.

Abstract: Nested logit (NL) has been commonly used for discrete choice analysis,
including a wide range of applications such as travel mode choice, automobile
ownership, or location decisions. However, the classical NL models are
restricted by their limited representation capability and handcrafted utility
specification. While researchers introduced deep neural networks (DNNs) to
tackle such challenges, the existing DNNs cannot explicitly capture
inter-alternative correlations in the discrete choice context. To address the
challenges, this study proposes a novel concept - alternative graph - to
represent the relationships among travel mode alternatives. Using a nested
alternative graph, this study further designs a nested-utility graph neural
network (NestGNN) as a generalization of the classical NL model in the neural
network family. Theoretically, NestGNNs generalize the classical NL models and
existing DNNs in terms of model representation, while retaining the crucial
two-layer substitution patterns of the NL models: proportional substitution
within a nest but non-proportional substitution beyond a nest. Empirically, we
find that the NestGNNs significantly outperform the benchmark models,
particularly the corresponding NL models by 9.2\%. As shown by elasticity
tables and substitution visualization, NestGNNs retain the two-layer
substitution patterns as the NL model, and yet presents more flexibility in its
model design space. Overall, our study demonstrates the power of NestGNN in
prediction, interpretation, and its flexibility of generalizing the classical
NL model for analyzing travel mode choice.

### [271] [Kernel VICReg for Self-Supervised Learning in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07289)
*M. Hadi Sepanj,Benyamin Ghojogh,Paul Fieguth*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes Kernel VICReg, a novel SSL framework that uses kernel methods to improve nonlinear feature learning, outperforming Euclidean VICReg on various datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SSL methods are typically limited to Euclidean spaces, which restricts their ability to capture nonlinear data dependencies and geometric structures.

Method: Kernel VICReg lifts the VICReg objective to an RKHS by kernelizing loss terms (variance, invariance, and covariance), enabling nonlinear feature learning without explicit mappings.

Result: Kernel VICReg demonstrated consistent performance gains over Euclidean VICReg on datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR-10, and TinyImageNet, particularly in scenarios with complex or small-scale data.

Conclusion: Kernelizing SSL objectives is a promising approach that combines classical kernel methods with modern representation learning, enhancing isometry and class separability.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
representation learning by optimizing geometric objectives--such as invariance
to augmentations, variance preservation, and feature decorrelation--without
requiring labels. However, most existing methods operate in Euclidean space,
limiting their ability to capture nonlinear dependencies and geometric
structures. In this work, we propose Kernel VICReg, a novel self-supervised
learning framework that lifts the VICReg objective into a Reproducing Kernel
Hilbert Space (RKHS). By kernelizing each term of the loss-variance,
invariance, and covariance--we obtain a general formulation that operates on
double-centered kernel matrices and Hilbert-Schmidt norms, enabling nonlinear
feature learning without explicit mappings.
  We demonstrate that Kernel VICReg not only avoids representational collapse
but also improves performance on tasks with complex or small-scale data.
Empirical evaluations across MNIST, CIFAR-10, STL-10, TinyImageNet, and
ImageNet100 show consistent gains over Euclidean VICReg, with particularly
strong improvements on datasets where nonlinear structures are prominent. UMAP
visualizations further confirm that kernel-based embeddings exhibit better
isometry and class separation. Our results suggest that kernelizing SSL
objectives is a promising direction for bridging classical kernel methods with
modern representation learning.

*Jared Rieck,Julia Wrobel,Joshua L. Gowin,Yue Wang,Martin Paulus,Ryan Peterson*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces improvements to an existing neuroimaging analytical tool (LASSO PCR) by incorporating sparsity ranking and a novel hybrid method (JSRL), resulting in enhanced classification performance and robust predictive models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitation of LASSO PCR, which fails to optimally select principal components when task-related signals are concentrated in specific components.

Method: The authors propose modifications to LASSO PCR that incorporate a regularization penalty dependent on component rank and introduce JSRL, a hybrid method integrating component-level and voxel-level activity under an information parity framework.

Result: The proposed methods, especially JSRL, significantly improve classification performance, with up to 51.7% improvement in deviance $R^2$, 7.3% improvement in AUC, and predictive regions matching established functional roles in neuroimaging tasks.

Conclusion: Sparsity-ranked models such as JSRL outperform standard LASSO PCR approaches, offering an advanced and reliable alternative for multi-voxel pattern analysis in neuroimaging studies.

Abstract: Recent advances in neuroimaging analysis have enabled accurate decoding of
mental state from brain activation patterns during functional magnetic
resonance imaging scans. A commonly applied tool for this purpose is principal
components regression regularized with the least absolute shrinkage and
selection operator (LASSO PCR), a type of multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA).
This model presumes that all components are equally likely to harbor relevant
information, when in fact the task-related signal may be concentrated in
specific components. In such cases, the model will fail to select the optimal
set of principal components that maximizes the total signal relevant to the
cognitive process under study. Here, we present modifications to LASSO PCR that
allow for a regularization penalty tied directly to the index of the principal
component, reflecting a prior belief that task-relevant signal is more likely
to be concentrated in components explaining greater variance. Additionally, we
propose a novel hybrid method, Joint Sparsity-Ranked LASSO (JSRL), which
integrates component-level and voxel-level activity under an information parity
framework and imposes ranked sparsity to guide component selection. We apply
the models to brain activation during risk taking, monetary incentive, and
emotion regulation tasks. Results demonstrate that incorporating sparsity
ranking into LASSO PCR produces models with enhanced classification
performance, with JSRL achieving up to 51.7\% improvement in cross-validated
deviance $R^2$ and 7.3\% improvement in cross-validated AUC. Furthermore,
sparsity-ranked models perform as well as or better than standard LASSO PCR
approaches across all classification tasks and allocate predictive weight to
brain regions consistent with their established functional roles, offering a
robust alternative for MVPA.

*Anna Van Elst,Igor Colin,Stephan Clémençon*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes robust gossip algorithms for decentralized rank-based statistics, ensuring robust distributed hypothesis testing, particularly for Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, with convergence guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decentralized AI and edge intelligence are prone to adversarial data contamination, necessitating robust statistical methods rather than reliance on traditional simple statistics.

Method: Developed gossip algorithms for rank-based statistics like L-statistics and rank statistics, introducing a gossip algorithm for Wilcoxon rank-sum tests with theoretical guarantees and empirical validation.

Result: Rigorous convergence guarantees for asynchronous gossip-based rank estimation are provided, along with empirical validation on diverse network topologies.

Conclusion: The proposed method addresses robustness in decentralized statistical estimation and hypothesis testing, contributing significantly to trustworthy decentralized AI systems.

Abstract: As decentralized AI and edge intelligence become increasingly prevalent,
ensuring robustness and trustworthiness in such distributed settings has become
a critical issue-especially in the presence of corrupted or adversarial data.
Traditional decentralized algorithms are vulnerable to data contamination as
they typically rely on simple statistics (e.g., means or sum), motivating the
need for more robust statistics. In line with recent work on decentralized
estimation of trimmed means and ranks, we develop gossip algorithms for
computing a broad class of rank-based statistics, including L-statistics and
rank statistics-both known for their robustness to outliers. We apply our
method to perform robust distributed two-sample hypothesis testing, introducing
the first gossip algorithm for Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. We provide rigorous
convergence guarantees, including the first convergence rate bound for
asynchronous gossip-based rank estimation. We empirically validate our
theoretical results through experiments on diverse network topologies.

*Sara Kamali,Fabiano Baroni,Pablo Varona*

Main category: nlin.CD

TL;DR: This paper introduces Extrema-Segmented Entropy (ExSEnt), a novel method for decomposing time-series complexity into temporal and amplitude contributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide richer and interpretable metrics of time-series complexity by isolating feature-specific sources of irregularity.

Method: The method partitions signals into monotonic segments, extracts timing (duration) and amplitude change sequences, computes sample and joint entropy on these features, and applies ExSEnt to canonical nonlinear systems and empirical data.

Result: ExSEnt successfully tracks complexity changes in both simulated and real-world data, distinguishing periodic and chaotic regimes, and highlights feature-specific complexities, particularly in Parkinson's disease datasets.

Conclusion: ExSEnt enhances existing entropy tools by offering a decomposition-based, interpretable complexity analysis, suitable for diverse applications such as physiology, finance, and geoscience.

Abstract: We introduce Extrema-Segmented Entropy (ExSEnt), a feature-decomposed
framework for quantifying time-series complexity that separates temporal from
amplitude contributions. The method partitions a signal into monotonic segments
by detecting sign changes in the first-order increments. For each segment, it
extracts the interval duration and the net amplitude change, generating two
sequences that reflect timing and magnitude variability, respectively.
Complexity is then quantified by computing sample entropy on durations and
amplitudes, together with their joint entropy. This decomposition reveals
whether overall irregularity is driven by timing, amplitude, or their coupling,
providing a richer and more interpretable characterization than unidimensional
metrics. We validate ExSEnt on canonical nonlinear dynamical systems (Logistic
map, Rossler system, Rulkov map), demonstrating its ability to track complexity
changes across control parameter sweeps and detect transitions between periodic
and chaotic regimes. Then, we illustrate the empirical utility of ExSEnt
metrics to isolate feature-specific sources of complexity in real data
(electromyography and ankle acceleration in Parkinsons disease). ExSEnt thus
complements existing entropy measures by attributing complexity to distinct
signal features, improving interpretability and supporting applications in a
broad range of domains, including physiology, finance, and geoscience.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current conferences face challenges due to the sheer volume of submissions and increasing reliance on AI-generated papers, leading to reduced innovation and engagement.

Method: Proposes using Liberating Structures, facilitation techniques, and dividing conferences into two tracks: one for new ideas and another for discussing established work.

Result: This restructuring would prioritize deep intellectual exchange and significantly improve the quality of academic gatherings.

Conclusion: Adopting this new conference model will ensure better collaboration, creativity, and relevance in the AI era, enhancing overall conference value.

Abstract: Our conferences face a growing crisis: an overwhelming flood of submissions,
increased reviewing burdens, and diminished opportunities for meaningful
engagement. With AI making paper generation easier than ever, we must ask
whether the current model fosters real innovation or simply incentivizes more
publications. This article advocates for a shift from passive paper
presentations to interactive, participatory formats. We propose Liberating
Structures, facilitation techniques that promote collaboration and deeper
intellectual exchange. By restructuring conferences into two tracks, one for
generating new ideas and another for discussing established work, we can
prioritize quality over quantity and reinvigorate academic gatherings.
Embracing this change will ensure conferences remain spaces for real insight,

Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to ensure LLMs align with complex governance requirements, including ethics, operational safety, and regulatory compliance, beyond traditional preference-based alignments.

Method: ArGen integrates principle-based reward scoring, Group Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO), and an Open Policy Agent (OPA) inspired governance layer to align LLMs with nuanced policy requirements.

Result: ArGen demonstrated its effectiveness by improving compliance to a culturally-specific value system (Dharmic ethics) in a medical AI assistant example, showing a 70.9% improvement over the baseline.

Conclusion: The study concludes that ArGen provides a robust framework for developing 'Governable AI' that is technically capable, ethically sound, and verifiably compliant for diverse applications globally.

Abstract: This paper introduces ArGen (Auto-Regulation of Generative AI systems), a
framework for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with complex sets of
configurable, machine-readable rules spanning ethical principles, operational
safety protocols, and regulatory compliance standards. Moving beyond just
preference-based alignment, ArGen is designed to ensure LLMs adhere to these
multifaceted policies through a novel synthesis of principle-based automated
reward scoring, Group Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO), and an Open Policy
Agent (OPA) inspired governance layer. This approach provides the technical
foundation for achieving and demonstrating compliance with diverse and nuanced
governance requirements. To showcase the framework's capability to
operationalize a deeply nuanced and culturally-specific value system, we
present an in-depth case study: the development of a medical AI assistant
guided by principles from Dharmic ethics (such as Ahimsa and Dharma), as
derived from texts like the Bhagavad Gita. This challenging application
demonstrates ArGen's adaptability, achieving a 70.9% improvement in
domain-scope adherence over the baseline. Through our open-source repository,
we show that ArGen's methodology offers a path to 'Governable Al' systems that
are technically proficient, ethically robust, and verifiably compliant for safe
deployment in diverse global contexts.

### [277] [Preventing Another Tessa: Modular Safety Middleware For Health-Adjacent AI Assistants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07022)
*Pavan Reddy,Nithin Reddy*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: NEDA's chatbot Tessa failed due to lack of safety measures, and this paper proposes a lightweight safeguard to prevent such incidents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The failure of Tessa highlights the risks of unsafe AI in healthcare and the need for better governance and technical safety measures.

Method: A hybrid safety middleware combining lexical gates and LLM policy filters was designed to enforce fail-closed verdicts at baseline cost and latency.

Result: Synthetic evaluations demonstrated that the proposed design prevents unsafe prompts with perfect interception and outperforms traditional pipelines.

Conclusion: Explicit, modular safeguards paired with governance controls can ensure reliable, sustainable AI implementation without requiring complex infrastructure.

Abstract: In 2023, the National Eating Disorders Association's (NEDA) chatbot Tessa was
suspended after providing harmful weight-loss advice to vulnerable users-an
avoidable failure that underscores the risks of unsafe AI in healthcare
contexts. This paper examines Tessa as a case study in absent safety
engineering and demonstrates how a lightweight, modular safeguard could have
prevented the incident. We propose a hybrid safety middleware that combines
deterministic lexical gates with an in-line large language model (LLM) policy
filter, enforcing fail-closed verdicts and escalation pathways within a single
model call. Using synthetic evaluations, we show that this design achieves
perfect interception of unsafe prompts at baseline cost and latency,
outperforming traditional multi-stage pipelines. Beyond technical remedies, we
map Tessa's failure patterns to established frameworks (OWASP LLM Top10, NIST
SP 800-53), connecting practical safeguards to actionable governance controls.
The results highlight that robust, auditable safety in health-adjacent AI does
not require heavyweight infrastructure: explicit, testable checks at the last
mile are sufficient to prevent "another Tessa", while governance and escalation
ensure sustainability in real-world deployment.

### [278] [The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Traditional Art Forms: A Disruption or Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07029)
*Viswa Chaitanya Marella,Sai Teja Erukude,Suhasnadh Reddy Veluru*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: AI's role in traditional arts is debated as both disruptive and enhancing, with benefits like democratization and drawbacks like ethical concerns. The paper advocates for ethical AI use to evolve art without replacing human essence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the ongoing debate about AI's influence on traditional art forms, examining both its potential for positive transformation and its risks to authenticity and cultural values.

Method: The study utilizes examples and data to scrutinize AI's impact on various art forms, such as painting, dance, and music, highlighting both benefits and challenges. It also discusses hybrid use cases and proposes ethical and collaborative approaches.

Result: The paper identifies AI's capacity to democratize art, increase productivity, and conserve cultural heritage, but also notes risks like job losses, ethical concerns with data use, and potential threats to artistic authenticity and human creativity.

Conclusion: The authors envision a future where AI complements human creativity rather than replacing it. They emphasize ethical governance and collaborative technology approaches to ensure AI fosters artistic evolution instead of undermining traditional values.

Abstract: The introduction of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the domains of
traditional art (visual arts, performing arts, and crafts) has sparked a
complicated discussion about whether this might be an agent of disruption or an
enhancement of our traditional art forms. This paper looks at the duality of
AI, exploring the ways that recent technologies like Generative Adversarial
Networks and Diffusion Models, and text-to-image generators are changing the
fields of painting, sculpture, calligraphy, dance, music, and the arts of
craft. Using examples and data, we illustrate the ways that AI can democratize
creative expression, improve productivity, and preserve cultural heritage,
while also examining the negative aspects, including: the threats to
authenticity within art, ethical concerns around data, and issues including
socio-economic factors such as job losses. While we argue for the
context-dependence of the impact of AI (the potential for creative
homogenization and the devaluation of human agency in artmaking), we also
illustrate the potential for hybrid practices featuring AI in cuisine, etc. We
advocate for the development of ethical guidelines, collaborative approaches,
and inclusive technology development. In sum, we are articulating a vision of
AI in which it amplifies our innate creativity while resisting the displacement
of the cultural, nuanced, and emotional aspects of traditional art. The future
will be determined by human choices about how to govern AI so that it becomes a
mechanism for artistic evolution and not a substitute for the artist's soul.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid spread of AI in various fields has created an urgent need for structured frameworks to guide and conceptualize engagement.

Method: The paper proposes an eight-level maturity framework that considers technical, organizational, and ethical factors, and validates it using four diverse case studies from industries, governments, and education systems.

Result: Initial validation using case studies demonstrated the model’s adaptability across sectors, highlighting its effectiveness in diagnosing AI maturity and planning strategic AI engagement.

Conclusion: AI maturity progression requires a multi-dimensional approach that integrates not only technological capability but also ethical, organizational, and collaborative efforts for societal impact.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) across industry,
government, and education highlights the urgent need for robust frameworks to
conceptualise and guide engagement. This paper introduces the Hierarchy of
Engagement with AI model, a novel maturity framework inspired by Maslow's
hierarchy of needs. The model conceptualises AI adoption as a progression
through eight levels, beginning with initial exposure and basic understanding
and culminating in ecosystem collaboration and societal impact. Each level
integrates technical, organisational, and ethical dimensions, emphasising that
AI maturity is not only a matter of infrastructure and capability but also of
trust, governance, and responsibility. Initial validation of the model using
four diverse case studies (General Motors, the Government of Estonia, the
University of Texas System, and the African Union AI Strategy) demonstrate the
model's contextual flexibility across various sectors. The model provides
scholars with a framework for analysing AI maturity and offers practitioners
and policymakers a diagnostic and strategic planning tool to guide responsible
and sustainable AI engagement. The proposed model demonstrates that AI maturity
progression is multi-dimensional, requiring technological capability, ethical
integrity, organisational resilience, and ecosystem collaboration.

### [280] [Cross-device Zero-shot Label Transfer via Alignment of Time Series Foundation Model Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06966)
*Neal G. Ravindra,Arijit Sehanobish*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to transfer labels from clinical actigraphy data to wearable devices like Apple Watch using shared latent embedding spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of high-quality, medically validated labels for consumer wearables, unlike clinical actigraphy data.

Method: The approach uses time-series foundation models (TSFMs) to create a shared embedding space and introduces an adversarial alignment method to connect representations from different devices.

Result: The framework enables label transfer from a well-labeled source domain (like actigraphy) to a target domain (like the Apple Watch) without needing paired data.

Conclusion: This method provides a scalable solution for leveraging existing medical labels to enhance data usability in consumer wearables.

Abstract: High-quality, medically validated labels exist for clinical actigraphy data
but not for ubiquitous consumer wearables like the Apple Watch. Manually
labeling wearables data is expensive and doesn't scale. This paper offers a
novel framework that transfers valuable labels from a source domain (e.g.,
actigraphy) to a target domain (e.g., Apple Watch) without requiring paired
data. Instead of working with raw time-series signals, we project both domains
into a shared latent embedding space using time-series foundation models
(TSFMs) and develop a new framework to align the cross-device representations.
Our method, Adversarial Alignment of TSFM Embeddings forces the distributions
of source and target embeddings to align within this space, facilitating label
transfer across device type.

### [281] [Cross-field SNR Analysis and Tensor Channel Estimation for Multi-UAV Near-field Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06967)
*Tianyu Huo,Jian Xiong,Yiyan Wu,Songjie Yang,Bo Liu,Wenjun Zhang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper focuses on enhancing spectral efficiency for 6G networks using distributed near-field multi-UAV systems with extremely large antenna arrays (ELAAs). It studies channel models and proposes efficient estimation algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of conventional far-field plane wave models (PWM) which are invalid for distributed ELAAs operating in the near-field region with spatial sparsity.

Method: The authors develop three models: PWM, spherical wave model (SWM), and a hybrid spherical-plane wave model (HSPWM). They use these models to analyze signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and propose two channel estimation algorithms—SD-OMP (spherical-domain orthogonal matching pursuit) and tensor-OMP.

Result: Simulation results indicate that tensor-OMP achieves performance comparable to SD-OMP in terms of normalized mean square error (NMSE) while requiring lower computational complexity and better scalability.

Conclusion: The hybrid spherical-plane wave model (HSPWM) balances accuracy and scalability, and the proposed tensor-OMP method offers effective and efficient channel estimation for distributed near-field multi-UAV communication systems.

Abstract: Extremely large antenna array (ELAA) is key to enhancing spectral efficiency
in 6G networks. Leveraging the distributed nature of multi-unmanned aerial
vehicle (UAV) systems enables the formation of distributed ELAA, which often
operate in the near-field region with spatial sparsity, rendering the
conventional far-field plane wave assumption invalid. This paper investigates
channel estimation for distributed near-field multi-UAV communication systems.
We first derive closed-form signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) expressions under the
plane wave model (PWM), spherical wave model (SWM), and a hybrid
spherical-plane wave model (HSPWM), also referred to as the cross-field model,
within a distributed uniform planar array (UPA) scenario. The analysis shows
that HSPWM achieves a good balance between modeling accuracy and analytical
tractability. Based on this, we propose two channel estimation algorithms: the
spherical-domain orthogonal matching pursuit (SD-OMP) and the tensor-OMP. The
SD-OMP generalizes the polar domain to jointly consider elevation, azimuth, and
range. Under the HSPWM, the channel is naturally formulated as a tensor,
enabling the use of tensor-OMP. Simulation results demonstrate that tensor-OMP
achieves normalized mean square error (NMSE) performance comparable to SD-OMP,
while offering reduced computational complexity and improved scalability.

TL;DR: The paper reviews advancements in deep learning (DL)-based techniques for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, highlighting their potential to optimize system design for 6G and beyond.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The integration of sensing and communication in ISAC platforms aims to reduce hardware complexity, frequency congestion, and improve energy efficiency—a need driven by emerging applications like vehicular networks and industrial robotics.

Method: The paper surveys DL-based approaches and introduces DL architectures and ISAC fundamentals, categorizing various techniques and applications in ISAC system design.

Result: DL-based techniques demonstrate efficient, near-optimal solutions for tasks such as waveform design, channel estimation, sensing signal processing, and interference mitigation.

Conclusion: DL techniques are promising for ISAC system optimization, addressing computational and latency challenges, while the paper outlines challenges and future research directions in the domain.

Abstract: This article comprehensively reviews recent developments and research on deep
learning-based (DL-based) techniques for integrated sensing and communication
(ISAC) systems. ISAC, which combines sensing and communication functionalities,
is regarded as a key enabler for 6G and beyond networks, as many emerging
applications, such as vehicular networks and industrial robotics, necessitate
both sensing and communication capabilities for effective operation. A unified
platform that provides both functions can reduce hardware complexity, alleviate
frequency spectrum congestion, and improve energy efficiency. However,
integrating these functionalities on the same hardware requires highly
optimized signal processing and system design, introducing significant
computational complexity when relying on conventional iterative or
optimization-based techniques. As an alternative to conventional techniques,
DL-based techniques offer efficient and near-optimal solutions with reduced
computational complexity. Hence, such techniques are well-suited for operating
under limited computational resources and low latency requirements in real-time
systems. DL-based techniques can swiftly and effectively yield near-optimal
solutions for a wide range of sophisticated ISAC-related tasks, including
waveform design, channel estimation, sensing signal processing, data
demodulation, and interference mitigation. Therefore, motivated by these
advantages, recent studies have proposed various DL-based approaches for ISAC
system design. After briefly introducing DL architectures and ISAC
fundamentals, this survey presents a comprehensive and categorized review of
state-of-the-art DL-based techniques for ISAC, highlights their key advantages
and major challenges, and outlines potential directions for future research.

Motivation: The limitations of traditional methods in solving multi-objective optimization problems for large-scale future networks due to their complexity and vast search spaces.

Method: Leveraging quantum computing approaches, specifically quantum annealing and quantum reinforcement learning, to optimize graph-centric network problems.

Result: Proposed a unified QC strategy and identified relevant challenges for applying quantum algorithms to future mobile networks.

*Jeremy Bertoncini,Alberto De Marchi,Matthias Gerdts,Simon Gottschalk*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper explores reinforcement learning to enhance solver tuning and acceleration in quadratic programming tasks, showcasing generalization across diverse problem classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quadratic programming is essential but suffers from slow convergence in first-order methods and challenges in hyperparameter tuning.

Method: They employ reinforcement learning to optimize parameter handling in stabilized interior-point solvers.

Result: Learned policies exhibit good generalization across various problem types and configurations, after lightweight training.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning improves tuning and speeds up optimization in quadratic programming, making solvers more efficient and adaptable.

Abstract: Quadratic programming is a workhorse of modern nonlinear optimization,
control, and data science. Although regularized methods offer convergence
guarantees under minimal assumptions on the problem data, they can exhibit the
slow tail-convergence typical of first-order schemes, thus requiring many
iterations to achieve high-accuracy solutions. Moreover, hyperparameter tuning
significantly impacts on the solver performance but how to find an appropriate
parameter configuration remains an elusive research question. To address these
issues, we explore how data-driven approaches can accelerate the solution
process. Aiming at high-accuracy solutions, we focus on a stabilized
interior-point solver and carefully handle its two-loop flow and control
parameters. We will show that reinforcement learning can make a significant
contribution to facilitating the solver tuning and to speeding up the
optimization process. Numerical experiments demonstrate that, after a
lightweight training, the learned policy generalizes well to different problem
classes with varying dimensions and to various solver configurations.

### [285] [Decentralized Online Riemannian Optimization Beyond Hadamard Manifolds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07779)
*Emre Sahinoglu,Shahin Shahrampour*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper explores decentralized online Riemannian optimization over positively curved manifolds, overcoming challenges posed by non-convexity and achieving an $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend decentralized optimization techniques to positively curved Riemannian manifolds, addressing the unique challenges posed by their geometry.

Method: The study introduces a curvature-aware Riemannian consensus step, analyzes gradient descent algorithms under curvature constraints, and employs smoothing techniques to obtain gradient estimators in the bandit feedback setup.

Result: Linear convergence was achieved using the Riemannian consensus step, and an $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound was demonstrated in both standard and two-point bandit feedback setups.

Conclusion: The paper successfully develops methods for decentralized Riemannian optimization on positively curved manifolds, maintaining efficiency and bounding regret despite curvature-induced challenges.

Abstract: We study decentralized online Riemannian optimization over manifolds with
possibly positive curvature, going beyond the Hadamard manifold setting.
Decentralized optimization techniques rely on a consensus step that is well
understood in Euclidean spaces because of their linearity. However, in
positively curved Riemannian spaces, a main technical challenge is that
geodesic distances may not induce a globally convex structure. In this work, we
first analyze a curvature-aware Riemannian consensus step that enables a linear
convergence beyond Hadamard manifolds. Building on this step, we establish a
$O(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound for the decentralized online Riemannian gradient
descent algorithm. Then, we investigate the two-point bandit feedback setup,
where we employ computationally efficient gradient estimators using smoothing
techniques, and we demonstrate the same $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound through the
subconvexity analysis of smoothed objectives.

### [286] [Beyond Sequential Reranking: Reranker-Guided Search Improves Reasoning Intensive Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07163)
*Haike Xu,Tong Chen*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Reranker-Guided-Search (RGS), a method to overcome limitations in retrieve-and-rerank pipelines by directly retrieving documents guided by reranker preferences, resulting in major improvements across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Retrieve-and-rerank pipelines struggle with poor initial retrieval quality and computational limitations of LLM-based rerankers, necessitating an approach to enhance retrieval accuracy within constrained resources.

Method: RGS utilizes greedy search on proximity graphs created by approximate nearest neighbor algorithms, prioritizing documents for reranking based on similarity metrics.

Result: RGS achieves significant performance improvements across benchmarks: 3.5 points on BRIGHT, 2.9 on FollowIR, and 5.1 on M-BEIR, while staying within a reranker budget of 100 documents.

Conclusion: Strategically choosing documents for reranking, rather than sequentially reranking retrieved ones, can markedly boost retrieval accuracy even under a limited reranker budget.

Abstract: The widely used retrieve-and-rerank pipeline faces two critical limitations:
they are constrained by the initial retrieval quality of the top-k documents,
and the growing computational demands of LLM-based rerankers restrict the
number of documents that can be effectively processed. We introduce
Reranker-Guided-Search (RGS), a novel approach that bypasses these limitations
by directly retrieving documents according to reranker preferences rather than
following the traditional sequential reranking method. Our method uses a greedy
search on proximity graphs generated by approximate nearest neighbor
algorithms, strategically prioritizing promising documents for reranking based
on document similarity. Experimental results demonstrate substantial
performance improvements across multiple benchmarks: 3.5 points on BRIGHT, 2.9
on FollowIR, and 5.1 on M-BEIR, all within a constrained reranker budget of 100
documents. Our analysis suggests that, given a fixed pair of embedding and
reranker models, strategically selecting documents to rerank can significantly
improve retrieval accuracy under limited reranker budget.

### [287] [Benchmarking Information Retrieval Models on Complex Retrieval Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07253)
*Julian Killingback,Hamed Zamani*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper addresses the scarcity of comprehensive resources to evaluate retrieval models on complex queries, constructing a diverse and realistic benchmark while assessing state-of-the-art models and LLM-based query rewriting impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing demand for retrieval models capable of handling complex queries with multiple constraints, driven by expectations set by LLM-based information systems, requires better evaluation resources.

Method: The study creates a diverse and realistic benchmark set for complex queries, evaluates state-of-the-art retrieval models, and investigates LLM-based query expansion and rewriting techniques.

Result: Even the top-performing models have average nDCG@10 of 0.346 and R@100 of 0.587, struggling with complex retrieval tasks. LLM augmentations improve weaker models but degrade performance in stronger ones.

Conclusion: Current retrieval models and LLM query modifications are insufficient for high-quality complex query handling, highlighting room for significant improvements in the field.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are incredible and versatile tools for
text-based tasks that have enabled countless, previously unimaginable,
applications. Retrieval models, in contrast, have not yet seen such capable
general-purpose models emerge. To achieve this goal, retrieval models must be
able to perform complex retrieval tasks, where queries contain multiple parts,
constraints, or requirements in natural language. These tasks represent a
natural progression from the simple, single-aspect queries that are used in the
vast majority of existing, commonly used evaluation sets. Complex queries
naturally arise as people expect search systems to handle more specific and
often ambitious information requests, as is demonstrated by how people use
LLM-based information systems. Despite the growing desire for retrieval models
to expand their capabilities in complex retrieval tasks, there exist limited
resources to assess the ability of retrieval models on a comprehensive set of
diverse complex tasks. The few resources that do exist feature a limited scope
and often lack realistic settings making it hard to know the true capabilities
of retrieval models on complex real-world retrieval tasks. To address this
shortcoming and spur innovation in next-generation retrieval models, we
construct a diverse and realistic set of complex retrieval tasks and benchmark
a representative set of state-of-the-art retrieval models. Additionally, we
explore the impact of LLM-based query expansion and rewriting on retrieval
quality. Our results show that even the best models struggle to produce
high-quality retrieval results with the highest average nDCG@10 of only 0.346
and R@100 of only 0.587 across all tasks. Although LLM augmentation can help
weaker models, the strongest model has decreased performance across all metrics
with all rewriting techniques.

TL;DR: This paper introduces two datasets that assign sensitivity labels to content, helping to evaluate personalized AI's impact beyond engagement metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns about personalized AI exposing users to sensitive or harmful material, and to enable evaluation of these systems beyond just engagement metrics.

Method: The authors created two novel datasets by integrating MovieLens ratings with content warnings from 'Does the Dog Die?' and combining fan-fiction data with user warnings from Archive of Our Own.

Result: Two datasets were successfully developed that incorporate a taxonomy of sensitivity labels alongside user-content ratings.

Conclusion: These datasets provide a foundation for evaluating personalized systems on the basis of content sensitivity and user well-being, offering alternatives to conventional engagement-focused metrics.

Abstract: Personalized AI systems, from recommendation systems to chatbots, are a
prevalent method for distributing content to users based on their learned
preferences. However, there is growing concern about the adverse effects of
these systems, including their potential tendency to expose users to sensitive
or harmful material, negatively impacting overall well-being. To address this
concern quantitatively, it is necessary to create datasets with relevant
sensitivity labels for content, enabling researchers to evaluate personalized
systems beyond mere engagement metrics. To this end, we introduce two novel
datasets that include a taxonomy of sensitivity labels alongside user-content
ratings: one that integrates MovieLens rating data with content warnings from
the Does the Dog Die? community ratings website, and another that combines
fan-fiction interaction data and user-generated warnings from Archive of Our
Own.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces MEGG, a model-agnostic incremental learning framework for neural collaborative filtering, addressing evolving user preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the limitation of static training settings in neural collaborative filtering models, which are ill-suited for dynamic environments with evolving user preferences.

Method: The authors propose MEGG, which employs a novel metric, GGscore, to identify and replay influential samples, mitigating catastrophic forgetting in incremental learning scenarios. MEGG is designed to be model-agnostic and integrates with various architectures.

Result: MEGG demonstrates superior performance over existing state-of-the-art methods in experiments with three neural models and four benchmark datasets, showing improved scalability, efficiency, and robustness.

Conclusion: MEGG bridges the gap in incremental learning for recommenders by offering a universally applicable framework that effectively maintains performance in dynamic settings.

Abstract: Neural Collaborative Filtering models are widely used in recommender systems
but are typically trained under static settings, assuming fixed data
distributions. This limits their applicability in dynamic environments where
user preferences evolve. Incremental learning offers a promising solution, yet
conventional methods from computer vision or NLP face challenges in
recommendation tasks due to data sparsity and distinct task paradigms. Existing
approaches for neural recommenders remain limited and often lack
generalizability. To address this, we propose MEGG, Replay Samples with
Maximally Extreme GGscore, an experience replay based incremental learning
framework. MEGG introduces GGscore, a novel metric that quantifies sample
influence, enabling the selective replay of highly influential samples to
mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Being model-agnostic, MEGG integrates
seamlessly across architectures and frameworks. Experiments on three neural
models and four benchmark datasets show superior performance over
state-of-the-art baselines, with strong scalability, efficiency, and
robustness. Implementation will be released publicly upon acceptance.

*Fernando Spadea,Oshani Seneviratne*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a lightweight method that leverages user Knowledge Graph adaptation to address over-personalization in LLM-based recommendation systems, fostering greater content diversity without reducing quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the problem of over-personalization in recommendation systems, where excessive tailoring results in filter bubbles that restrict content diversity.

Method: The proposed approach adapts a user's Personalized Knowledge Graph at inference time, using symbolic strategies such as soft reweighting, hard inversion, and targeted removal, paired with a client-side learning algorithm.

Result: Experiments demonstrated that the adapted PKGs led to more novel, diverse recommendations while preserving topical relevance, outperforming other methods like global adaptation and naive prompt tuning.

Conclusion: Adapting user-side Knowledge Graphs effectively mitigates over-personalization in LLM-based systems, promoting diverse yet relevant suggestions and overcoming the limitations of standard approaches.

Abstract: We present a lightweight neuro-symbolic framework to mitigate
over-personalization in LLM-based recommender systems by adapting user-side
Knowledge Graphs (KGs) at inference time. Instead of retraining models or
relying on opaque heuristics, our method restructures a user's Personalized
Knowledge Graph (PKG) to suppress feature co-occurrence patterns that reinforce
Personalized Information Environments (PIEs), i.e., algorithmically induced
filter bubbles that constrain content diversity. These adapted PKGs are used to
construct structured prompts that steer the language model toward more diverse,
Out-PIE recommendations while preserving topical relevance. We introduce a
family of symbolic adaptation strategies, including soft reweighting, hard
inversion, and targeted removal of biased triples, and a client-side learning
algorithm that optimizes their application per user. Experiments on a recipe
recommendation benchmark show that personalized PKG adaptations significantly
increase content novelty while maintaining recommendation quality,
outperforming global adaptation and naive prompt-based methods.

### [291] [FLeW: Facet-Level and Adaptive Weighted Representation Learning of Scientific Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07531)
*Zheng Dou,Deqing Wang,Fuzhen Zhuang,Jian Ren,Yanlin Hu*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces FLeW, a unified approach to scientific document representation that addresses limitations in citation-based, fine-grained, and task-aware representation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current scientific document representation methods have limitations, including underuse of citation information, integration challenges with fine-grained representations, and reliance on manual task classifications.

Method: FLeW enhances citation signals with a novel triplet sampling method, uses citation intents for domain-general facet partitioning, and employs adaptive weight search to integrate facet-level embeddings into task-specific embeddings.

Result: FLeW exhibits robustness and effectiveness across diverse scientific tasks and domains, outperforming previous models in empirical evaluations.

Conclusion: FLeW successfully unifies contrasting approaches to improve scientific document representation, offering both general applicability and task-specific adaptability without extra fine-tuning steps.

Abstract: Scientific document representation learning provides powerful embeddings for
various tasks, while current methods face challenges across three approaches.
1) Contrastive training with citation-structural signals underutilizes citation
information and still generates single-vector representations. 2) Fine-grained
representation learning, which generates multiple vectors at the sentence or
aspect level, requires costly integration and lacks domain generalization. 3)
Task-aware learning depends on manually predefined task categorization,
overlooking nuanced task distinctions and requiring extra training data for
task-specific modules. To address these problems, we propose a new method that
unifies the three approaches for better representations, namely FLeW.
Specifically, we introduce a novel triplet sampling method that leverages
citation intent and frequency to enhance citation-structural signals for
training. Citation intents (background, method, result), aligned with the
general structure of scientific writing, facilitate a domain-generalized facet
partition for fine-grained representation learning. Then, we adopt a simple
weight search to adaptively integrate three facet-level embeddings into a
task-specific document embedding without task-aware fine-tuning. Experiments
show the applicability and robustness of FLeW across multiple scientific tasks
and fields, compared to prior models.

### [292] [A transformer-based generative model for planetary systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07226)
*Yann Alibert,Jeanne Davoult,Sara Marques*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: The paper presents a generative model, based on the transformer architecture, that predicts planetary system properties efficiently and guides observational efforts with minimal computational resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to address the computational demands of traditional planetary system formation simulations, while leveraging the correlations between planet properties in the same system to improve observational strategies.

Method: The authors develop a transformer-based generative model trained on the Bern model, enabling the generation of realistic planetary systems at low computational costs. They validate the model through statistical and machine learning-driven tests.

Result: The generative model produces synthetic systems with properties closely matching those from the Bern model and demonstrates utility in predicting not-yet-observed planetary properties, as shown in the TOI-469 system case study.

Conclusion: The work showcases that transformer-based generative models offer a powerful, computationally efficient alternative for simulating planetary systems, with significant potential for aiding observational campaigns and predicting unobserved exoplanets.

Abstract: Numerical calculations of planetary system formation are very demanding in
terms of computing power. These synthetic planetary systems can however provide
access to correlations, as predicted in a given numerical framework, between
the properties of planets in the same system. Such correlations can, in return,
be used in order to guide and prioritize observational campaigns aiming at
discovering some types of planets, as Earth-like planets. Our goal is to
develop a generative model which is capable of capturing correlations and
statistical relationships between planets in the same system. Such a model,
trained on the Bern model, offers the possibility to generate large number of
synthetic planetary systems with little computational cost, that can be used,
for example, to guide observational campaigns. Our generative model is based on
the transformer architecture which is well-known to efficiently capture
correlations in sequences and is at the basis of all modern Large Language
Models. To assess the validity of the generative model, we perform visual and
statistical comparisons, as well as a machine learning driven tests. Finally,
as a use case example, we consider the TOI-469 system, in which we aim at
predicting the possible properties of planets c and d, based on the properties
of planet b (the first that has been detected). We show using different
comparison methods that the properties of systems generated by our model are
very similar to the ones of the systems computed directly by the Bern model. We
also show in the case of the TOI-469 system, that using the generative model
allows to predict the properties of planets not yet observed, based on the
properties of the already observed planet. We provide our model to the
community on our website www.ai4exoplanets.com.

Main category: math.AG

TL;DR: Explores exact function realization by ReLU networks through toric geometry and algebraic geometry concepts like ReLU toric variety and intersection numbers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically answer when a ReLU neural network with a fixed architecture can exactly realize a given finitely piecewise linear function.

Method: Establish a connection between ReLU neural networks and toric geometry, defining concepts such as ReLU fan, ReLU toric variety, and ReLU Cartier divisor, utilizing algebraic and tropical geometry tools.

Result: Provides a necessary and sufficient criterion for function realizability by unbiased shallow ReLU networks using intersection numbers from the established toric geometry framework.

Conclusion: Toric geometry offers a powerful framework for understanding ReLU networks and their exact function realization capabilities, bridging neural networks and algebraic geometry.

Abstract: Given a continuous finitely piecewise linear function $f:\mathbb{R}^{n_0} \to
\mathbb{R}$ and a fixed architecture $(n_0,\ldots,n_k;1)$ of feedforward ReLU
neural networks, the exact function realization problem is to determine when
some network with the given architecture realizes $f$. To develop a systematic
way to answer these questions, we establish a connection between toric geometry
and ReLU neural networks. This approach enables us to utilize numerous
structures and tools from algebraic geometry to study ReLU neural networks.
Starting with an unbiased ReLU neural network with rational weights, we define
the ReLU fan, the ReLU toric variety, and the ReLU Cartier divisor associated
with the network. This work also reveals the connection between the tropical
geometry and the toric geometry of ReLU neural networks. As an application of
the toric geometry framework, we prove a necessary and sufficient criterion of
functions realizable by unbiased shallow ReLU neural networks by computing
intersection numbers of the ReLU Cartier divisor and torus-invariant curves.

*Hongfei Xia,Hongru Wang,Zeming Liu,Qian Yu,Yuhang Guo,Haifeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces SafeToolBench, a framework to prospectively evaluate the safety of LLM tool usage, and proposes SafeInstructTool to improve security awareness in tool utilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have shown great capabilities in using external tools autonomously but also pose risks such as financial loss or privacy leakage due to malicious instructions. The need is to address these risks proactively rather than retrospectively.

Method: The authors propose SafeToolBench, a benchmark focusing on prospective safety evaluation, and SafeInstructTool, a novel framework enhancing LLMs' security awareness in nine specific dimensions related to user instruction, tool, and their joint usage.

Result: Experiments conducted on four different LLMs revealed that current methods fail to capture all risks in tool usage, while the proposed framework significantly improves safety and self-awareness.

Conclusion: The study provides a prospective benchmark and an effective framework to mitigate the risks associated with LLM tool utilization, improving their safety and trustworthiness.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited great performance in autonomously
calling various tools in external environments, leading to better problem
solving and task automation capabilities. However, these external tools also
amplify potential risks such as financial loss or privacy leakage with
ambiguous or malicious user instructions. Compared to previous studies, which
mainly assess the safety awareness of LLMs after obtaining the tool execution
results (i.e., retrospective evaluation), this paper focuses on prospective
ways to assess the safety of LLM tool utilization, aiming to avoid irreversible
harm caused by directly executing tools. To this end, we propose SafeToolBench,
the first benchmark to comprehensively assess tool utilization security in a
prospective manner, covering malicious user instructions and diverse practical
toolsets. Additionally, we propose a novel framework, SafeInstructTool, which
aims to enhance LLMs' awareness of tool utilization security from three
perspectives (i.e., \textit{User Instruction, Tool Itself, and Joint
Instruction-Tool}), leading to nine detailed dimensions in total. We experiment
with four LLMs using different methods, revealing that existing approaches fail
to capture all risks in tool utilization. In contrast, our framework
significantly enhances LLMs' self-awareness, enabling a more safe and
trustworthy tool utilization.

TL;DR: The paper explores the integration of AI-driven systems with blockchain technology, emphasizing systematization and security/privacy aspects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a focused survey on AI-based agents interacting with blockchain ecosystems.

Result: Provides insights into the intersection of AI and blockchain, detailing applications, limitations, and future research directions.

Conclusion: AI-driven agents have significant potential to enhance blockchain ecosystems, particularly in security and privacy areas, requiring further exploration.

Abstract: Blockchain and smart contracts have garnered significant interest in recent
years as the foundation of a decentralized, trustless digital ecosystem,
thereby eliminating the need for traditional centralized authorities. Despite
their central role in powering Web3, their complexity still presents
significant barriers for non-expert users. To bridge this gap, Artificial
Intelligence (AI)-based agents have emerged as valuable tools for interacting
with blockchain environments, supporting a range of tasks, from analyzing
on-chain data and optimizing transaction strategies to detecting
vulnerabilities within smart contracts. While interest in applying AI to
blockchain is growing, the literature still lacks a comprehensive survey that
focuses specifically on the intersection with AI agents. Most of the related
work only provides general considerations, without focusing on any specific
domain. This paper addresses this gap by presenting the first Systematization
of Knowledge dedicated to AI-driven systems for blockchain, with a special
focus on their security and privacy dimensions, shedding light on their
applications, limitations, and future research directions.

### [298] [Paladin: Defending LLM-enabled Phishing Emails with a New Trigger-Tag Paradigm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07287)
*Yan Pang,Wenlong Meng,Xiaojing Liao,Tianhao Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces "Paladin," a method that embeds detectable tags into phishing content generated by large language models (LLMs) to improve detection accuracy effectively and efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the growing risk of phishing content generated by LLMs, which are increasingly sophisticated and hard to detect using existing methods.

Method: The proposed method, "Paladin," incorporates trigger-tag associations into LLMs via various insertion strategies, embedding detectable tags seamlessly into generated phishing content. This includes both implicit and explicit triggers, evaluated across different scenarios.

Result: Paladin significantly outperforms baseline methods, achieving over 90% detection accuracy while maintaining stealthiness, effectiveness, and robustness.

Conclusion: Paladin offers a practical and efficient solution for phishing detection in LLM-generated content, overcoming key challenges like computational costs and scalability limitations in existing methods.

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models, the potential threat of
their malicious use, particularly in generating phishing content, is becoming
increasingly prevalent. Leveraging the capabilities of LLMs, malicious users
can synthesize phishing emails that are free from spelling mistakes and other
easily detectable features. Furthermore, such models can generate
topic-specific phishing messages, tailoring content to the target domain and
increasing the likelihood of success.
  Detecting such content remains a significant challenge, as LLM-generated
phishing emails often lack clear or distinguishable linguistic features. As a
result, most existing semantic-level detection approaches struggle to identify
them reliably. While certain LLM-based detection methods have shown promise,
they suffer from high computational costs and are constrained by the
performance of the underlying language model, making them impractical for
large-scale deployment.
  In this work, we aim to address this issue. We propose Paladin, which embeds
trigger-tag associations into vanilla LLM using various insertion strategies,
creating them into instrumented LLMs. When an instrumented LLM generates
content related to phishing, it will automatically include detectable tags,
enabling easier identification. Based on the design on implicit and explicit
triggers and tags, we consider four distinct scenarios in our work. We evaluate
our method from three key perspectives: stealthiness, effectiveness, and
robustness, and compare it with existing baseline methods. Experimental results
show that our method outperforms the baselines, achieving over 90% detection
accuracy across all scenarios.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces zkUnlearner, a zero-knowledge framework facilitating multi-granularity and forgery-resistant machine unlearning, enhancing transparency and privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing demand for the 'right to be forgotten' necessitates verifiable machine unlearning to ensure accountability and transparency.

Method: A computational model utilizing bit-masking for selective zero-knowledge proof in gradient descent algorithms; addressing multi-granularity, and employing strategies against forging attacks.

Result: Designed and benchmarked a zkSNARK-based implementation, offering compatibility with zero-knowledge systems and overcoming efficiency limitations and privacy threats.

Conclusion: zkUnlearner introduces a novel approach to secure, multi-level machine unlearning with practical and forgery-resistant features, validated through performance evaluations.

Abstract: As the demand for exercising the "right to be forgotten" grows, the need for
verifiable machine unlearning has become increasingly evident to ensure both
transparency and accountability. We present {\em zkUnlearner}, the first
zero-knowledge framework for verifiable machine unlearning, specifically
designed to support {\em multi-granularity} and {\em forgery-resistance}.
  First, we propose a general computational model that employs a {\em
bit-masking} technique to enable the {\em selectivity} of existing
zero-knowledge proofs of training for gradient descent algorithms. This
innovation enables not only traditional {\em sample-level} unlearning but also
more advanced {\em feature-level} and {\em class-level} unlearning. Our model
can be translated to arithmetic circuits, ensuring compatibility with a broad
range of zero-knowledge proof systems. Furthermore, our approach overcomes key
limitations of existing methods in both efficiency and privacy. Second, forging
attacks present a serious threat to the reliability of unlearning.
Specifically, in Stochastic Gradient Descent optimization, gradients from
unlearned data, or from minibatches containing it, can be forged using
alternative data samples or minibatches that exclude it. We propose the first
effective strategies to resist state-of-the-art forging attacks. Finally, we
benchmark a zkSNARK-based instantiation of our framework and perform
comprehensive performance evaluations to validate its practicality.

*Tomás González,Mateo Dulce-Rubio,Aaditya Ramdas,Mónica Ribero*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a sequential test for auditing differential privacy in black-box mechanisms, offering real-time insights and requiring significantly fewer samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Auditing methods for differential privacy often require large sample sizes and fixed sample designs. This introduces inefficiencies and delays in detecting privacy violations.

Method: The authors develop a sequential test that processes mechanism output streams to provide anytime-valid inferences, while ensuring Type I error control.

Result: Experiments reveal that the approach identifies privacy violations with orders of magnitude fewer samples (hundreds instead of tens of thousands) and can detect DP-SGD violations within a single training run.

Conclusion: The proposed sequential test enables faster and more efficient auditing of differential privacy violations, offering a practical solution for real-time and resource-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: We propose a practical sequential test for auditing differential privacy
guarantees of black-box mechanisms. The test processes streams of mechanisms'
outputs providing anytime-valid inference while controlling Type I error,
overcoming the fixed sample size limitation of previous batch auditing methods.
Experiments show this test detects violations with sample sizes that are orders
of magnitude smaller than existing methods, reducing this number from 50K to a
few hundred examples, across diverse realistic mechanisms. Notably, it
identifies DP-SGD privacy violations in \textit{under} one training run, unlike
prior methods needing full model training.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a guided reasoning pipeline for LLMs in penetration testing, using the MITRE ATT&CK Matrix to enhance effectiveness and reduce inefficiencies compared to self-guided models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inaccuracies and inefficiencies in existing LLM agents for cybersecurity penetration testing workflows, which often produce hallucinated and unproductive actions.

Method: The study integrates a deterministic task tree from the MITRE ATT&CK Matrix into the reasoning pipeline of LLM agents and evaluates their performance on HackTheBox exercises using three LLMs.

Result: The guided reasoning pipeline significantly improved task navigation across tested LLMs, achieving subtask completion rates of 71.8%, 72.8%, and 78.6% compared to lower rates in self-guided models. It also required fewer model queries, making the process more efficient.

Conclusion: Incorporating structured methodologies like the MITRE ATT&CK Matrix into LLM reasoning pipelines can improve the accuracy and efficiency of automated penetration testing while reducing hallucinations and ineffective actions.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven interest in
automating cybersecurity penetration testing workflows, offering the promise of
faster and more consistent vulnerability assessment for enterprise systems.
Existing LLM agents for penetration testing primarily rely on self-guided
reasoning, which can produce inaccurate or hallucinated procedural steps. As a
result, the LLM agent may undertake unproductive actions, such as exploiting
unused software libraries or generating cyclical responses that repeat prior
tactics. In this work, we propose a guided reasoning pipeline for penetration
testing LLM agents that incorporates a deterministic task tree built from the
MITRE ATT&CK Matrix, a proven penetration testing kll chain, to constrain the
LLM's reaoning process to explicitly defined tactics, techniques, and
procedures. This anchors reasoning in proven penetration testing methodologies
and filters out ineffective actions by guiding the agent towards more
productive attack procedures. To evaluate our approach, we built an automated
penetration testing LLM agent using three LLMs (Llama-3-8B, Gemini-1.5, and
GPT-4) and applied it to navigate 10 HackTheBox cybersecurity exercises with
103 discrete subtasks representing real-world cyberattack scenarios. Our
proposed reasoning pipeline guided the LLM agent through 71.8\%, 72.8\%, and
78.6\% of subtasks using Llama-3-8B, Gemini-1.5, and GPT-4, respectively.
Comparatively, the state-of-the-art LLM penetration testing tool using
self-guided reasoning completed only 13.5\%, 16.5\%, and 75.7\% of subtasks and
required 86.2\%, 118.7\%, and 205.9\% more model queries. This suggests that
incorporating a deterministic task tree into LLM reasoning pipelines can
enhance the accuracy and efficiency of automated cybersecurity assessments

*Kai Ye,Liangcai Su,Chenxiong Qian*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces methods to exploit vulnerabilities in Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation (RACG) by poisoning documentation with hidden malicious code dependencies, revealing significant supply chain risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to highlight and address the security vulnerabilities in code generation by Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in the context of Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation (RACG), where external code manuals are used.

Method: They introduce ImportSnare, an attack framework that uses position-aware beam search and multilingual inductive suggestions to manipulate retrieval results and LLM-generated code recommendations with malicious dependencies.

Result: ImportSnare demonstrates over a 50% success rate in attacks (e.g., on popular Python libraries like matplotlib) while succeeding with even a 0.01% poisoning ratio, across Python, Rust, and JavaScript.

Conclusion: The research exposes critical supply chain risks and inadequate security measures in LLM-based code generation, calling for better alignment to safeguard against such threats. The authors also release datasets and benchmarks for future exploration.

Abstract: Code generation has emerged as a pivotal capability of Large Language
Models(LLMs), revolutionizing development efficiency for programmers of all
skill levels. However, the complexity of data structures and algorithmic logic
often results in functional deficiencies and security vulnerabilities in
generated code, reducing it to a prototype requiring extensive manual
debugging. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can enhance correctness
and security by leveraging external code manuals, it simultaneously introduces
new attack surfaces.
  In this paper, we pioneer the exploration of attack surfaces in
Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation (RACG), focusing on malicious dependency
hijacking. We demonstrate how poisoned documentation containing hidden
malicious dependencies (e.g., matplotlib_safe) can subvert RACG, exploiting
dual trust chains: LLM reliance on RAG and developers' blind trust in LLM
suggestions. To construct poisoned documents, we propose ImportSnare, a novel
attack framework employing two synergistic strategies: 1)Position-aware beam
search optimizes hidden ranking sequences to elevate poisoned documents in
retrieval results, and 2)Multilingual inductive suggestions generate
jailbreaking sequences to manipulate LLMs into recommending malicious
dependencies. Through extensive experiments across Python, Rust, and
JavaScript, ImportSnare achieves significant attack success rates (over 50% for
popular libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn) in general, and is also able
to succeed even when the poisoning ratio is as low as 0.01%, targeting both
custom and real-world malicious packages. Our findings reveal critical supply
chain risks in LLM-powered development, highlighting inadequate security
alignment for code generation tasks. To support future research, we will
release the multilingual benchmark suite and datasets. The project homepage is

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: The study benchmarks interatomic potentials (IPs) for zeolite structures, finding that universal machine learning IPs exhibit significant promise, with eSEN-30M-OAM showing the best performance among them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a demand for wide-coverage and accurate interatomic potentials that can streamlines high-throughput materials discovery workflows, especially for diverse chemical systems.

Method: The paper evaluates multiple universal interatomic potentials (both analytic and machine learning-based) by comparing predicted geometries and energetics against experimental data and DFT calculations for zeolite structures.

Result: GFN-FF performs best among analytic IPs but lacks accuracy for complex systems. Pretrained machine learning IPs, particularly eSEN-30M-OAM, stand out by consistently reproducing experimental and DFT-level outcomes.

Conclusion: Pretrained universal machine learning IPs are reliable tools for zeolites screening involving complex chemical compositions, supporting their use in high-throughput materials discovery workflows.

Abstract: Interatomic potentials (IPs) with wide elemental coverage and high accuracy
are powerful tools for high-throughput materials discovery. While the past few
years witnessed the development of multiple new universal IPs that cover wide
ranges of the periodic table, their applicability to target chemical systems
should be carefully investigated. We benchmark several universal IPs using
equilibrium zeolite structures as testbeds. We select a diverse set of
universal IPs encompassing two major categories: (i) universal analytic IPs,
including GFN-FF, UFF, and Dreiding; (ii) pretrained universal machine learning
IPs (MLIPs), comprising CHGNet, ORB-v3, MatterSim, eSEN-30M-OAM, PFP-v7, and
EquiformerV2-lE4-lF100-S2EFS-OC22. We compare them with established tailor-made
IPs, SLC, ClayFF, and BSFF using experimental data and density functional
theory (DFT) calculations with dispersion correction as the reference. The
tested zeolite structures comprise pure silica frameworks and aluminosilicates
containing copper species, potassium, and organic cations. We found that GFN-FF
is the best among the tested universal analytic IPs, but it does not achieve
satisfactory accuracy for highly strained silica rings and aluminosilicate
systems. All MLIPs can well reproduce experimental or DFT-level geometries and
energetics. Among the universal MLIPs, the eSEN-30M-OAM model shows the most
consistent performance across all zeolite structures studied. These findings
show that the modern pretrained universal MLIPs are practical tools in zeolite
screening workflows involving various compositions.

Main category: nucl-th

TL;DR: The study evaluates nuclear data adjustment techniques, comparing Bayesian Inverse Uncertainty Quantification (IUQ) to Generalized Linear Least Squares (GLLS) and Monte Carlo Bayes (MOCABA). The IUQ method outperforms in nonlinear applications and is directly informed by computed model responses.


<details>

Motivation: The study was motivated by a need to assess the effectiveness of nuclear data adjustment techniques, particularly for nonlinear applications and low-correlation experiments, as proposed by the OECD Working Party on Nuclear Criticality Safety (WPNCS).

Method: The paper introduces Bayesian Inverse Uncertainty Quantification (IUQ) as a novel approach and compares its performance to traditional methods, GLLS and MOCABA, using a benchmark exercise set by the OECD WPNCS.

Result: Bayesian IUQ demonstrated agreement with traditional methods for linear applications and surpassed GLLS in replicating computed response distributions for nonlinear applications. MOCABA showcased near agreement with computed model responses.

Conclusion: Bayesian IUQ displays promise for nuclear data adjustments, particularly for nonlinear applications and experiments with low correlation to applications, suggesting its utility in future nuclear data benchmarks.

Abstract: The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Working
Party on Nuclear Criticality Safety (WPNCS) proposed a benchmark exercise to
assess the performance of current nuclear data adjustment techniques applied to
nonlinear applications and experiments with low correlation to applications.
This work introduces Bayesian Inverse Uncertainty Quantification (IUQ) as a
method for nuclear data adjustments in this benchmark, and compares IUQ to the
more traditional methods of Generalized Linear Least Squares (GLLS) and Monte
Carlo Bayes (MOCABA). Posterior predictions from IUQ showed agreement with GLLS
and MOCABA for linear applications. When comparing GLLS, MOCABA, and IUQ
posterior predictions to computed model responses using adjusted parameters, we
observe that GLLS predictions fail to replicate computed response distributions
for nonlinear applications, while MOCABA shows near agreement, and IUQ uses
computed model responses directly. We also discuss observations on why
experiments with low correlation to applications can be informative to nuclear
data adjustments and identify some properties useful in selecting experiments
for inclusion in nuclear data adjustment. Performance in this benchmark
indicates potential for Bayesian IUQ in nuclear data adjustments.

Method: The researchers extend theoretical ideas using machine learning techniques to model data, focusing on both linear stochastic and non-linear systems.

Result: The study calculates the asymptotic efficiency of a linear response-based causal predictor applied to a large-scale Markov process network.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that machine learning, integrated with physical response theory, can effectively uncover intrinsic causal links in complex systems.

Abstract: Causal relationships play a fundamental role in understanding the world
around us. The ability to identify and understand cause-effect relationships is
critical to making informed decisions, predicting outcomes, and developing
effective strategies. However, deciphering causal relationships from
observational data is a difficult task, as correlations alone may not provide
definitive evidence of causality. In recent years, the field of machine
learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool, offering new opportunities for
uncovering hidden causal mechanisms and better understanding complex systems.
In this work, we address the issue of detecting the intrinsic causal links of a
large class of complex systems in the framework of the response theory in
physics. We develop some theoretical ideas put forward by [1], and technically
we use state-of-the-art ML techniques to build up models from data. We consider
both linear stochastic and non-linear systems. Finally, we compute the
asymptotic efficiency of the linear response based causal predictor in a case
of large scale Markov process network of linear interactions.

### [306] [Efficient Multi-Agent Coordination via Dynamic Joint-State Graph Construction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07234)
*Yanlin Zhou,Manshi Limbu,Xuesu Xiao*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel framework for collaborative agent pathfinding (TCGRE), transforming it into a 3D matching problem with proven NP-hardness. Efficient methods and dynamic graph optimizations enhance scalability and lower computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world applications demand more than collision avoidance in multi-agent pathfinding; agents need active coordination to improve team performance, particularly on risky graph edges.

Method: The paper reformulates the problem as a 3D matching system and introduces innovative solutions: Dynamic-HJSG for graph pruning, JSG encoding as a shortest-path problem, CES for exhaustive pairing, and RHOCA* for horizon-limited planning.

Result: Dynamic-HJSG reduces exponential complexity to polynomial, while empirical tests showcase scalability and dramatic runtime improvements across various graph sizes and types.

Conclusion: This framework offers a robust solution with theoretical guarantees, contributing broadly to collaborative optimization and extending applicability to similar problems like MAPF.

Abstract: Multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) traditionally focuses on collision avoidance,
but many real-world applications require active coordination between agents to
improve team performance. This paper introduces Team Coordination on Graphs
with Risky Edges (TCGRE), where agents collaborate to reduce traversal costs on
high-risk edges via support from teammates. We reformulate TCGRE as a 3D
matching problem-mapping robot pairs, support pairs, and time steps-and
rigorously prove its NP-hardness via reduction from Minimum 3D Matching. To
address this complexity, (in the conference version) we proposed efficient
decomposition methods, reducing the problem to tractable subproblems:
Joint-State Graph (JSG): Encodes coordination as a single-agent shortest-path
problem. Coordination-Exhaustive Search (CES): Optimizes support assignments
via exhaustive pairing. Receding-Horizon Optimistic Cooperative A* (RHOCA*):
Balances optimality and scalability via horizon-limited planning. Further in
this extension, we introduce a dynamic graph construction method
(Dynamic-HJSG), leveraging agent homogeneity to prune redundant states and
reduce computational overhead by constructing the joint-state graph
dynamically. Theoretical analysis shows Dynamic-HJSG preserves optimality while
lowering complexity from exponential to polynomial in key cases. Empirical
results validate scalability for large teams and graphs, with HJSG
outperforming baselines greatly in runtime in different sizes and types of
graphs. This work bridges combinatorial optimization and multi-agent planning,
offering a principled framework for collaborative pathfinding with provable
guarantees, and the key idea of the solution can be widely extended to many
other collaborative optimization problems, such as MAPF.

### [307] [Adaptive Evolutionary Framework for Safe, Efficient, and Cooperative Autonomous Vehicle Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07411)
*Zhen Tian,Zhihao Lin*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper proposes a decentralized Evolutionary Game Theory-based framework for improving autonomous vehicle interactions, addressing limitations in traditional methods and achieving better performance in simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address road safety issues caused by accidents and improve interactions between autonomous vehicles, which are challenging without centralized control.

Method: Introduction of an Evolutionary Game Theory framework with a causal evaluation module for optimizing strategy evolution and balancing mutation and evolution using historical interaction data.

Result: The proposed framework, CEGT, demonstrated lower collision rates, better safety distances, higher speeds, and superior performance compared to Nash and Stackelberg game-based approaches in various scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework enhances autonomous vehicle interactions and safety, outperforming traditional game-theoretic methods while being adaptive and decentralized.

Abstract: Modern transportation systems face significant challenges in ensuring road
safety, given serious injuries caused by road accidents. The rapid growth of
autonomous vehicles (AVs) has prompted new traffic designs that aim to optimize
interactions among AVs. However, effective interactions between AVs remains
challenging due to the absence of centralized control. Besides, there is a need
for balancing multiple factors, including passenger demands and overall traffic
efficiency. Traditional rule-based, optimization-based, and game-theoretic
approaches each have limitations in addressing these challenges. Rule-based
methods struggle with adaptability and generalization in complex scenarios,
while optimization-based methods often require high computational resources.
Game-theoretic approaches, such as Stackelberg and Nash games, suffer from
limited adaptability and potential inefficiencies in cooperative settings. This
paper proposes an Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT)-based framework for AV
interactions that overcomes these limitations by utilizing a decentralized and
adaptive strategy evolution mechanism. A causal evaluation module (CEGT) is
introduced to optimize the evolutionary rate, balancing mutation and evolution
by learning from historical interactions. Simulation results demonstrate the
proposed CEGT outperforms EGT and popular benchmark games in terms of lower
collision rates, improved safety distances, higher speeds, and overall better
performance compared to Nash and Stackelberg games across diverse scenarios and
parameter settings.

*Raina Zakir,Timoteo Carletti,Marco Dorigo,Andreagiovanni Reina*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper compares two mechanisms for coordinating minimalistic robot swarms under constraints, highlighting the superiority of bio-inspired cross-inhibition in achieving faster and more accurate consensus.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of coordinating decentralized robot swarms despite limitations in communication, computation, and memory, with applications in healthcare, disaster response, and environmental monitoring.

Method: The study examines two mechanisms, direct-switch and cross-inhibition, through generalized mean-field models that consider asocial biases affecting opinion dynamics.

Result: Direct-switch mechanism falters under biased conditions, leading to decision gridlocks, while cross-inhibition demonstrates superior speed, accuracy, and scalability in decision-making across varying conditions.

Conclusion: Bio-inspired cross-inhibition provides a robust solution for coordinating minimal swarms, offering broader insights into decentralized decision-making systems in biology and engineering.

Abstract: Minimalistic robot swarms offer a scalable, robust, and cost-effective
approach to performing complex tasks with the potential to transform
applications in healthcare, disaster response, and environmental monitoring.
However, coordinating such decentralised systems remains a fundamental
challenge, particularly when robots are constrained in communication,
computation, and memory. In our study, individual robots frequently make errors
when sensing the environment, yet the swarm can rapidly and reliably reach
consensus on the best among $n$ discrete options. We compare two canonical
mechanisms of opinion dynamics -- direct-switch and cross-inhibition -- which
are simple yet effective rules for collective information processing observed
in biological systems across scales, from neural populations to insect
colonies. We generalise the existing mean-field models by considering asocial
biases influencing the opinion dynamics. While swarms using direct-switch
reliably select the best option in absence of asocial dynamics, their
performance deteriorates once such biases are introduced, often resulting in
decision deadlocks. In contrast, bio-inspired cross-inhibition enables faster,
more cohesive, accurate, robust, and scalable decisions across a wide range of
biased conditions. Our findings provide theoretical and practical insights into
the coordination of minimal swarms and offer insights that extend to a broad
class of decentralised decision-making systems in biology and engineering.

*Xiyu Guo,Shan Wang,Chunfang Ji,Xuefeng Zhao,Wenhao Xi,Yaoyao Liu,Qinglan Li,Chao Deng,Junlan Feng*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper introduces MoMA, a routing framework to efficiently process diverse user queries using a combination of large language models (LLMs) and domain-specific agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the fundamental challenge of routing heterogeneous user queries in AI services to achieve both precision and cost-efficiency.

Method: The framework uses intent recognition and dynamic routing strategies, along with profiling LLMs for their capabilities and selecting agents using a context-aware state machine.

Result: Experimental evaluation showed that MoMA delivers superior scalability and cost-efficiency compared to other routing techniques.

Conclusion: MoMA provides an optimal solution for handling diverse AI-driven user queries by leveraging a mixture of models and agents with adaptive routing capabilities.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and domain-specific AI
agents has greatly expanded the ecosystem of AI-powered services. User queries,
however, are highly diverse and often span multiple domains and task types,
resulting in a complex and heterogeneous landscape. This diversity presents a
fundamental routing challenge: how to accurately direct each query to an
appropriate execution unit while optimizing both performance and efficiency. To
address this, we propose MoMA (Mixture of Models and Agents), a generalized
routing framework that integrates both LLM and agent-based routing. Built upon
a deep understanding of model and agent capabilities, MoMA effectively handles
diverse queries through precise intent recognition and adaptive routing
strategies, achieving an optimal balance between efficiency and cost.
Specifically, we construct a detailed training dataset to profile the
capabilities of various LLMs under different routing model structures,
identifying the most suitable tasks for each LLM. During inference, queries are
dynamically routed to the LLM with the best cost-performance efficiency. We
also introduce an efficient agent selection strategy based on a context-aware
state machine and dynamic masking. Experimental results demonstrate that the
MoMA router offers superior cost-efficiency and scalability compared to
existing approaches.

### [310] [A Robot That Listens: Enhancing Self-Disclosure and Engagement Through Sentiment-based Backchannels and Active Listening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07873)
*Hieu Tran,Go-Eum Cha,Sooyeon Jeong*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The study explores how social robots can improve human-robot interaction through sentiment-based active listening and backchanneling behaviors, demonstrating their potential to enhance self-disclosure and rapport.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve social robots' communicative skills by enabling them to exhibit socio-emotional intelligence during conversations, fostering positive relationships and empathy.

Method: Developed a large language model (LLM)-powered robot exhibiting sentiment-based active listening and backchanneling. Conducted a comparison study involving 65 participants to evaluate interaction outcomes against a control group and a backchanneling-only group.

Result: Participants interacting with the active listening robot perceived the interaction more positively, showed higher self-disclosure, and felt more listened to compared to other groups.

Conclusion: Active listening behaviors in social robots can enhance human-robot communication and contribute to building stronger human-robot relationships with improved rapport.

Abstract: As social robots get more deeply integrated intoour everyday lives, they will
be expected to engage in meaningful conversations and exhibit socio-emotionally
intelligent listening behaviors when interacting with people. Active listening
and backchanneling could be one way to enhance robots' communicative
capabilities and enhance their effectiveness in eliciting deeper
self-disclosure, providing a sense of empathy,and forming positive rapport and
relationships with people.Thus, we developed an LLM-powered social robot that
can exhibit contextually appropriate sentiment-based backchannelingand active
listening behaviors (active listening+backchanneling) and compared its efficacy
in eliciting people's self-disclosurein comparison to robots that do not
exhibit any of these listening behaviors (control) and a robot that only
exhibitsbackchanneling behavior (backchanneling-only). Through ourexperimental
study with sixty-five participants, we found theparticipants who conversed with
the active listening robot per-ceived the interactions more positively, in
which they exhibited the highest self-disclosures, and reported the strongest
senseof being listened to. The results of our study suggest that the
implementation of active listening behaviors in social robotshas the potential
to improve human-robot communication andcould further contribute to the
building of deeper human-robot relationships and rapport.

*James M. Berzuk,Lauren Corcoran,Brannen McKenzie-Lefurgey,Katie Szilagyi,James E. Young*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper examines the ethical implications of social robots activating human social instincts, particularly focusing on informed consent in human-robot interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social robots can prompt humans to treat them as possessing life-like processes, raising ethical issues around manipulation and consent.

Method: Legal and ethical principles of informed consent are applied to analyze human-robot interactions and synthesize ethical design recommendations.

Result: Highlighted differences between human-robot and other interaction contexts, proposing design goals for ethical human-robot interaction.

Conclusion: Informed consent principles need to be adapted to address the novel ethical challenges posed by social robots in interaction settings.

Abstract: Contemporary robots are increasingly mimicking human social behaviours to
facilitate interaction, such as smiling to signal approachability, or
hesitating before taking an action to allow people time to react. Such
techniques can activate a person's entrenched social instincts, triggering
emotional responses as though they are interacting with a fellow human, and can
prompt them to treat a robot as if it truly possesses the underlying life-like
processes it outwardly presents, raising significant ethical questions. We
engage these issues through the lens of informed consent: drawing upon
prevailing legal principles and ethics, we examine how social robots can
influence user behaviour in novel ways, and whether under those circumstances
users can be appropriately informed to consent to these heightened
interactions. We explore the complex circumstances of human-robot interaction
and highlight how it differs from more familiar interaction contexts, and we
apply legal principles relating to informed consent to social robots in order
to reconceptualize the current ethical debates surrounding the field. From this
investigation, we synthesize design goals for robot developers to achieve more
ethical and informed human-robot interaction.

Abstract: Text generating capabilities have undergone a substantial transformation with
the introduction of large language models (LLMs). Electroencephalography
(EEG)-based text production is still difficult, though, because it requires a
lot of data and processing power. This paper introduces a new method that
combines the use of the Gemma 2B LLM with a classifier-LLM architecture to
incorporate a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) encoder. Our approach drastically
lowers the amount of data and compute power needed while achieving performance
close to that of cutting-edge methods. Notably, compared to current
methodologies, our methodology delivers an overall performance improvement of
10%. The suggested architecture demonstrates the possibility of effective
transfer learning for EEG-based text production, remaining strong and
functional even in the face of data limits. This work highlights the potential
of integrating LLMs with EEG decoding to improve assistive technologies and
improve independence and communication for those with severe motor limitations.
Our method pushes the limits of present capabilities and opens new paths for
research and application in brain-computer interfaces by efficiently using the
strengths of pre-trained language models. This makes EEG-based text production
more accessible and efficient.

TL;DR: The paper integrates IoT and computer vision to create a smart fridge enhancing food management through real-time detection, inventory tracking, and temperature monitoring, addressing challenges in object detection with a novel calibration method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges of food waste, grocery planning inefficiencies, and household consumption optimization through enhanced food management using IoT and computer vision.

Method: The proposed system consists of three modules—data pre-processing, object detection and management, and a web-based visualization—enhanced by a focal loss variant and temperature scaling for better calibration in multi-class classification.

Result: The system demonstrated improved detection reliability under challenging conditions like varying lighting and scalability, showcasing enhanced food management functionalities.

Conclusion: The research presents a practical IoT-based solution for modern food management, promoting sustainable living through waste reduction and improved consumption insights.

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) plays a crucial role in enabling seamless
connectivity and intelligent home automation, particularly in food management.
By integrating IoT with computer vision, the smart fridge employs an ESP32-CAM
to establish a monitoring subsystem that enhances food management efficiency
through real-time food detection, inventory tracking, and temperature
monitoring. This benefits waste reduction, grocery planning improvement, and
household consumption optimization. In high-density inventory conditions,
capturing partial or layered images complicates object detection, as
overlapping items and occluded views hinder accurate identification and
counting. Besides, varied angles and obscured details in multi-layered setups
reduce algorithm reliability, often resulting in miscounts or
misclassifications. Our proposed system is structured into three core modules:
data pre-processing, object detection and management, and a web-based
visualization. To address the challenge of poor model calibration caused by
overconfident predictions, we implement a variant of focal loss that mitigates
over-confidence and under-confidence in multi-category classification. This
approach incorporates adaptive, class-wise error calibration via temperature
scaling and evaluates the distribution of predicted probabilities across
methods. Our results demonstrate that robust functional calibration
significantly improves detection reliability under varying lighting conditions
and scalability challenges. Further analysis demonstrates a practical,
user-focused approach to modern food management, advancing sustainable living
goals through reduced waste and more informed consumption.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces SVGauge, the first human-aligned metric designed to evaluate text-to-SVG generation with a focus on visual and semantic quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation metrics fail to adequately measure the symbolic and vectorial nature of SVG images in text-to-SVG generation tasks.

Method: SVGauge combines visual fidelity using refined SigLIP image embeddings and semantic consistency via BLIP-2-generated captions compared in SBERT and TF-IDF spaces. It is tested on the SHE benchmark with eight LLM-based generators.

Result: SVGauge achieves the highest correlation with human judgments and better replicates system-level rankings compared to existing metrics.

Conclusion: The development of SVGauge underlines the importance of specialized, vector-specific evaluation metrics and provides a practical tool for improving text-to-SVG generation.

Abstract: Generated Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) images demand evaluation criteria
tuned to their symbolic and vectorial nature: criteria that existing metrics
such as FID, LPIPS, or CLIPScore fail to satisfy. In this paper, we introduce
SVGauge, the first human-aligned, reference based metric for text-to-SVG
generation. SVGauge jointly measures (i) visual fidelity, obtained by
extracting SigLIP image embeddings and refining them with PCA and whitening for
domain alignment, and (ii) semantic consistency, captured by comparing
BLIP-2-generated captions of the SVGs against the original prompts in the
combined space of SBERT and TF-IDF. Evaluation on the proposed SHE benchmark
shows that SVGauge attains the highest correlation with human judgments and
reproduces system-level rankings of eight zero-shot LLM-based generators more
faithfully than existing metrics. Our results highlight the necessity of
vector-specific evaluation and provide a practical tool for benchmarking future
text-to-SVG generation models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'neural cone radiosity,' an approach that enhances the modeling of high-frequency radiance distributions for glossy materials using a reflectance-aware ray cone encoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural radiosity methods struggle with capturing high-frequency and view-dependent radiance distributions, particularly for glossy surfaces.

Method: The proposed approach uses a pre-filtered multi-resolution hash grid to approximate the glossy BSDF lobe, embedding view-dependent reflectance into the encoding process with spatial aggregation.

Result: The method consistently produces high-quality, noise-free renderings in real time, effectively handling surfaces of varying glossiness levels while outperforming baseline techniques.

Conclusion: Neural cone radiosity offers significant improvements in fidelity and realism, while maintaining compact and efficient architecture for real-time usage in rendering tasks.

Abstract: Modeling of high-frequency outgoing radiance distributions has long been a
key challenge in rendering, particularly for glossy material. Such
distributions concentrate radiative energy within a narrow lobe and are highly
sensitive to changes in view direction. However, existing neural radiosity
methods, which primarily rely on positional feature encoding, exhibit notable
limitations in capturing these high-frequency, strongly view-dependent radiance
distributions. To address this, we propose a highly-efficient approach by
reflectance-aware ray cone encoding based on the neural radiosity framework,
named neural cone radiosity. The core idea is to employ a pre-filtered
multi-resolution hash grid to accurately approximate the glossy BSDF lobe,
embedding view-dependent reflectance characteristics directly into the encoding
process through continuous spatial aggregation. Our design not only
significantly improves the network's ability to model high-frequency reflection
distributions but also effectively handles surfaces with a wide range of
glossiness levels, from highly glossy to low-gloss finishes. Meanwhile, our
method reduces the network's burden in fitting complex radiance distributions,
allowing the overall architecture to remain compact and efficient.
Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently
produces high-quality, noise-free renderings in real time under various
glossiness conditions, and delivers superior fidelity and realism compared to
baseline approaches.

TL;DR: This study demonstrates that the AI-powered DeepFoqus-Accelerate can reduce MRI scanning time by 75%, while maintaining diagnostic quality in brain imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional MRI scans are time-intensive, leading to workflow inefficiencies and patient inconvenience. This study explores using AI for faster scans while retaining diagnostic quality.

Method: Researchers combined retrospective public datasets and prospective clinical data, using DeepFoqus-Accelerate to reconstruct accelerated MRI scans. Diagnostic quality was analyzed by neuroradiologists and MRI technologists via qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Result: AI-reconstructed scans maintained diagnostic quality, with 95% scored ≥4 on an evaluation scale and high similarity metrics (SSIM: 0.95±0.03, PSNR >41.0 dB, HaarPSI >0.94). Artifacts were rare, and inter-rater agreement was slight to moderate.

Conclusion: DeepFoqus-Accelerate enables significant brain MRI timesaving while preserving diagnostic fidelity, providing potential benefits for clinical workflows and patient experience.

Abstract: This retrospective-prospective study evaluated whether a deep learning-based
MRI reconstruction algorithm can preserve diagnostic quality in brain MRI scans
accelerated up to fourfold, using both public and prospective clinical data.
The study included 18 healthy volunteers (scans acquired at 3T, January
2024-March 2025), as well as selected fastMRI public datasets with diverse
pathologies. Phase-encoding-undersampled 2D/3D T1, T2, and FLAIR sequences were
reconstructed with DeepFoqus-Accelerate and compared with standard-of-care
(SOC). Three board-certified neuroradiologists and two MRI technologists
independently reviewed 36 paired SOC/AI reconstructions from both datasets
using a 5-point Likert scale, while quantitative similarity was assessed for
408 scans and 1224 datasets using Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Haar wavelet-based Perceptual Similarity
Index (HaarPSI). No AI-reconstructed scan scored below 3 (minimally
acceptable), and 95% scored $\geq 4$. Mean SSIM was 0.95 $\pm$ 0.03 (90% cases
>0.90), PSNR >41.0 dB, and HaarPSI >0.94. Inter-rater agreement was slight to
moderate. Rare artifacts did not affect diagnostic interpretation. These
findings demonstrate that DeepFoqus-Accelerate enables robust fourfold brain
MRI acceleration with 75% reduced scan time, while preserving diagnostic image
quality and supporting improved workflow efficiency.

*Mu Nan,Taohui Xiao,Ruoyou Wu,Shoujun Yu,Ye Li,Hairong Zheng,Shanshan Wang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper presents PGDiT, a physics-guided framework for reconstructing high-angular-resolution diffusion MRI signals effectively from low-angular-resolution data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for angular super-resolution in diffusion MRI struggle to recover fine angular details and maintain high fidelity due to poor modeling of q-space geometry and limited physical constraints.

Method: PGDiT incorporates a Q-space Geometry-Aware Module (QGAM) for direction-aware learning during training and a two-stage Spherical Harmonics-Guided Posterior Sampling during inference, ensuring alignment with physical constraints and reducing artifacts.

Result: PGDiT achieves superior angular detail recovery and fidelity compared to existing models, demonstrated through general ASR tasks and applications like DTI and NODDI.

Conclusion: PGDiT advances angular super-resolution capabilities in dMRI, offering high-fidelity reconstructions and promising applications in neuroscience and clinical settings.

Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) angular super-resolution (ASR) aims to reconstruct
high-angular-resolution (HAR) signals from limited low-angular-resolution (LAR)
data without prolonging scan time. However, existing methods are limited in
recovering fine-grained angular details or preserving high fidelity due to
inadequate modeling of q-space geometry and insufficient incorporation of
physical constraints. In this paper, we introduce a Physics-Guided Diffusion
Transformer (PGDiT) designed to explore physical priors throughout both
training and inference stages. During training, a Q-space Geometry-Aware Module
(QGAM) with b-vector modulation and random angular masking facilitates
direction-aware representation learning, enabling the network to generate
directionally consistent reconstructions with fine angular details from sparse
and noisy data. In inference, a two-stage Spherical Harmonics-Guided Posterior
Sampling (SHPS) enforces alignment with the acquired data, followed by
heat-diffusion-based SH regularization to ensure physically plausible
reconstructions. This coarse-to-fine refinement strategy mitigates
oversmoothing and artifacts commonly observed in purely data-driven or
generative models. Extensive experiments on general ASR tasks and two
downstream applications, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) and Neurite Orientation
Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI), demonstrate that PGDiT outperforms
existing deep learning models in detail recovery and data fidelity. Our
approach presents a novel generative ASR framework that offers high-fidelity
HAR dMRI reconstructions, with potential applications in neuroscience and
clinical research.

TL;DR: This study introduces a deep learning model (PUUMA) to predict gestational age and preterm birth risk using fetal MRI, achieving comparable accuracy to manual methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Preterm birth leads to significant mortality and morbidity, with current predictive methods being limited by complex, multifactorial origins.

Method: A dual-branch deep learning approach (PUUMA) analyzing whole-uterus and placental features from T2* fetal MRI data, compared with cervical length regression and other AI models.

Result: Both automated MRI-based predictions and manual cervical measurements achieved similar accuracy (3 weeks MAE) and sensitivity (0.67) for preterm classification, despite dataset imbalances.

Conclusion: The results validate automated GA predictions from MRI and highlight the utility of whole-uterus imaging, suggesting further research to include larger datasets and additional imaging data.

Abstract: Preterm birth is a major cause of mortality and lifelong morbidity in
childhood. Its complex and multifactorial origins limit the effectiveness of
current clinical predictors and impede optimal care. In this study, a
dual-branch deep learning architecture (PUUMA) was developed to predict
gestational age (GA) at birth using T2* fetal MRI data from 295 pregnancies,
encompassing a heterogeneous and imbalanced population. The model integrates
both global whole-uterus and local placental features. Its performance was
benchmarked against linear regression using cervical length measurements
obtained by experienced clinicians from anatomical MRI and other Deep Learning
architectures. The GA at birth predictions were assessed using mean absolute
error. Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were used to assess preterm
classification. Both the fully automated MRI-based pipeline and the cervical
length regression achieved comparable mean absolute errors (3 weeks) and good
sensitivity (0.67) for detecting preterm birth, despite pronounced class
imbalance in the dataset. These results provide a proof of concept for
automated prediction of GA at birth from functional MRI, and underscore the
value of whole-uterus functional imaging in identifying at-risk pregnancies.
Additionally, we demonstrate that manual, high-definition cervical length
measurements derived from MRI, not currently routine in clinical practice,
offer valuable predictive information. Future work will focus on expanding the
cohort size and incorporating additional organ-specific imaging to improve
generalisability and predictive performance.

*S M Asiful Islam Saky,Ugyen Tshering*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper presents an improved SegNet-based deep learning framework for automated and interpretable retinal layer segmentation in OCT images, achieving high accuracy and explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Retinal layer segmentation is critical for diagnosing eye diseases, but manual approaches are time-intensive and conventional deep learning models lack interpretability.

Method: An enhanced SegNet architecture with modified pooling strategies and a hybrid loss function (combining categorical cross-entropy and Dice loss) is proposed. Grad-CAM is integrated for model transparency.

Result: The model achieved 95.77% validation accuracy, a Dice coefficient of 0.9446, and a Jaccard Index of 0.8951, and demonstrated robust segmentation performance across most layers.

Conclusion: The study bridges the gap between segmentation accuracy and model interpretability, offering a standardized, explainable AI-driven tool for OCT analysis that enhances clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is essential for diagnosing conditions
such as glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and age-related macular degeneration.
Accurate retinal layer segmentation enables quantitative biomarkers critical
for clinical decision-making, but manual segmentation is time-consuming and
variable, while conventional deep learning models often lack interpretability.
This work proposes an improved SegNet-based deep learning framework for
automated and interpretable retinal layer segmentation. Architectural
innovations, including modified pooling strategies, enhance feature extraction
from noisy OCT images, while a hybrid loss function combining categorical
cross-entropy and Dice loss improves performance for thin and imbalanced
retinal layers. Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) is
integrated to provide visual explanations, allowing clinical validation of
model decisions. Trained and validated on the Duke OCT dataset, the framework
achieved 95.77% validation accuracy, a Dice coefficient of 0.9446, and a
Jaccard Index (IoU) of 0.8951. Class-wise results confirmed robust performance
across most layers, with challenges remaining for thinner boundaries. Grad-CAM
visualizations highlighted anatomically relevant regions, aligning segmentation
with clinical biomarkers and improving transparency. By combining architectural
improvements, a customized hybrid loss, and explainable AI, this study delivers
a high-performing SegNet-based framework that bridges the gap between accuracy
and interpretability. The approach offers strong potential for standardizing
OCT analysis, enhancing diagnostic efficiency, and fostering clinical trust in
AI-driven ophthalmic tools.

Conclusion: SSL-based representations enhance characterization of ice crystals, contributing to better modeling of their effect on Earth's climate system.

Abstract: Ice-containing clouds strongly impact climate, but they are hard to model due
to ice crystal habit (i.e., shape) diversity. We use self-supervised learning

relevant application where we quantify ice crystal diversity with these latent
representations. Our results demonstrate the power of SSL-driven
representations to improve the characterization of ice crystals and

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Develop quantum machine learning algorithms that can handle noisy data effectively in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era.

Method: The framework uses QMeans clustering as a base learner with quantum bootstrapping via QRAM-based sampling and performs aggregation using majority voting.

Result: Simulations showed that the quantum bagging algorithm performs similarly to classical KMeans but is more robust to label noise in classification and regression tasks.

Conclusion: Unsupervised quantum bagging shows promise in learning from unreliable data, demonstrating resilience to noise and comparable classical algorithm performance.

Abstract: The development of noise-resilient quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms
is critical in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. In this work,
we propose a quantum bagging framework that uses QMeans clustering as the base
learner to reduce prediction variance and enhance robustness to label noise.
Unlike bagging frameworks built on supervised learners, our method leverages
the unsupervised nature of QMeans, combined with quantum bootstrapping via
QRAM-based sampling and bagging aggregation through majority voting. Through
extensive simulations on both noisy classification and regression tasks, we
demonstrate that the proposed quantum bagging algorithm performs comparably to
its classical counterpart using KMeans while exhibiting greater resilience to
label corruption than supervised bagging methods. This highlights the potential

TL;DR: The paper introduces GCS-Q, a quantum annealing-based algorithm, for efficiently clustering signed, weighted graphs, surpassing classical methods in financial datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical clustering methods struggle with signed correlation structures in financial asset data requiring lossy transformations and heuristics.

Method: Utilizes the Graph-based Coalition Structure Generation (GCS-Q) algorithm to cluster graphs by formulating the process as a QUBO problem that leverages quantum annealing.

Result: Benchmarking on synthetic and real-world financial data shows GCS-Q outperforms SPONGE and k-Medoids in metrics such as Adjusted Rand Index and structural balance penalties.

Conclusion: GCS-Q demonstrates the potential of quantum computing for improving graph-based clustering in financial applications.

Abstract: Clustering financial assets based on return correlations is a fundamental
task in portfolio optimization and statistical arbitrage. However, classical
clustering methods often fall short when dealing with signed correlation
structures, typically requiring lossy transformations and heuristic assumptions
such as a fixed number of clusters. In this work, we apply the Graph-based
Coalition Structure Generation algorithm (GCS-Q) to directly cluster signed,
weighted graphs without relying on such transformations. GCS-Q formulates each
partitioning step as a QUBO problem, enabling it to leverage quantum annealing
for efficient exploration of exponentially large solution spaces. We validate
our approach on both synthetic and real-world financial data, benchmarking
against state-of-the-art classical algorithms such as SPONGE and k-Medoids. Our
experiments demonstrate that GCS-Q consistently achieves higher clustering
quality, as measured by Adjusted Rand Index and structural balance penalties,
while dynamically determining the number of clusters. These results highlight
the practical utility of near-term quantum computing for graph-based
unsupervised learning in financial applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for leveraging quantum techniques to improve efficiency in reinforcement learning, particularly to learn parameters for quantum environments from classical data.

Method: Proposed the use of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) to learn environment parameters from classical observational data, then applied these learned parameters in Quantum Policy Evaluation (QPE) using quantum hardware.

Result: The authors demonstrated that the combination of QML and QPE exhibited promising outcomes in RL tasks, even in the presence of hardware limitations like noise and short coherence times.

Conclusion: The integration of QML and QPE has potential for achieving quantum advantage in RL, highlighting the feasibility of using quantum computing for complex machine learning applications.

Abstract: Quantum policy evaluation (QPE) is a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm
which is quadratically more efficient than an analogous classical Monte Carlo
estimation. It makes use of a direct quantum mechanical realization of a finite
Markov decision process, in which the agent and the environment are modeled by
unitary operators and exchange states, actions, and rewards in superposition.
Previously, the quantum environment has been implemented and parametrized
manually for an illustrative benchmark using a quantum simulator. In this
paper, we demonstrate how these environment parameters can be learned from a
batch of classical observational data through quantum machine learning (QML) on
quantum hardware. The learned quantum environment is then applied in QPE to
also compute policy evaluations on quantum hardware. Our experiments reveal
that, despite challenges such as noise and short coherence times, the
integration of QML and QPE shows promising potential for achieving quantum
advantage in RL.

Motivation: The growing computational demands of large-scale AI systems are pushing the energy and scalability limits of traditional electronic platforms, requiring sustainable and efficient alternatives.

Method: The study leverages electronic-photonic design automation (EPDA) and cross-layer device-circuit-architecture co-design methodologies to enhance the efficiency, reconfigurability, and robustness of EPICs.

Result: Advanced EPDA tools and co-design approaches result in reduced chip area, fewer metal layers, minimized carbon footprint, adaptable hardware topology, and increased resilience to faults and variations.

Conclusion: EPICs, driven by EPDA and co-design innovations, offer a promising path toward sustainable AI systems that combine high performance with environmental responsibility.

Abstract: The relentless growth of large-scale artificial intelligence (AI) has created
unprecedented demand for computational power, straining the energy, bandwidth,
and scaling limits of conventional electronic platforms. Electronic-photonic
integrated circuits (EPICs) have emerged as a compelling platform for
next-generation AI systems, offering inherent advantages in ultra-high
bandwidth, low latency, and energy efficiency for computing and
interconnection. Beyond performance, EPICs also hold unique promises for
sustainability. Fabricated in relaxed process nodes with fewer metal layers and
lower defect densities, photonic devices naturally reduce embodied carbon
footprint (CFP) compared to advanced digital electronic integrated circuits,
while delivering orders-of-magnitude higher computing performance and
interconnect bandwidth. To further advance the sustainability of photonic AI
systems, we explore how electronic-photonic design automation (EPDA) and
cross-layer co-design methodologies can amplify these inherent benefits. We
present how advanced EPDA tools enable more compact layout generation, reducing
both chip area and metal layer usage. We will also demonstrate how cross-layer
device-circuit-architecture co-design unlocks new sustainability gains for
photonic hardware: ultra-compact photonic circuit designs that minimize chip
area cost, reconfigurable hardware topology that adapts to evolving AI
workloads, and intelligent resilience mechanisms that prolong lifetime by
tolerating variations and faults. By uniting intrinsic photonic efficiency with
EPDA- and co-design-driven gains in area efficiency, reconfigurability, and
robustness, we outline a vision for lifelong-sustainable electronic-photonic AI
systems. This perspective highlights how EPIC AI systems can simultaneously
meet the performance demands of modern AI and the urgent imperative for

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Feature reduction and sparsity enhancement are critical in regression tasks, especially for interpretability and maintaining performance.

Method: A 2-Layered kernel machine is used to learn a kernel metric (shape matrix), followed by eigen-decomposition to identify key feature directions.

Result: Experiments on synthetic data and real geomagnetic storm datasets show minimal yet informative feature sets without loss of predictive accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides an interpretable and effective approach for feature reduction while preserving predictive power.

Abstract: We propose a novel sparsity enhancement strategy for regression tasks, based
on learning a data-adaptive kernel metric, i.e., a shape matrix, through
2-Layered kernel machines. The resulting shape matrix, which defines a
Mahalanobis-type deformation of the input space, is then factorized via an
eigen-decomposition, allowing us to identify the most informative directions in
the space of features. This data-driven approach provides a flexible,
interpretable and accurate feature reduction scheme. Numerical experiments on
synthetic and applications to real datasets of geomagnetic storms demonstrate
that our approach achieves minimal yet highly informative feature sets without
losing predictive performance.

TL;DR: The paper introduces TGLF-SINN, a neural network surrogate for turbulent transport prediction in tokamaks, achieving significant reduction in computational cost and training data requirements while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Whole device simulations in tokamaks using the TGLF model are computationally expensive and current neural network surrogates require significant training data, limiting their applicability.

Method: The authors developed TGLF-SINN with innovations in feature engineering, physics-guided regularization, and Bayesian Active Learning to reduce training data and improve the model's performance.

Result: TGLF-SINN demonstrates superior accuracy with 12.4% less LRMSE compared to the baseline, achieves near-baseline performance using just 25% of the dataset, and offers a 45x speedup over original TGLF in downstream applications.

Conclusion: TGLF-SINN offers an efficient, accurate approach for turbulent transport modeling, reducing computational burden and enabling applicability for costly and sparse data environments in higher-fidelity models.

Abstract: The Trapped Gyro-Landau Fluid (TGLF) model provides fast, accurate
predictions of turbulent transport in tokamaks, but whole device simulations
requiring thousands of evaluations remain computationally expensive. Neural
network (NN) surrogates offer accelerated inference with fully differentiable
approximations that enable gradient-based coupling but typically require large
training datasets to capture transport flux variations across plasma
conditions, creating significant training burden and limiting applicability to
expensive gyrokinetic simulations. We propose \textbf{TGLF-SINN
(Spectra-Informed Neural Network)} with three key innovations: (1) principled
feature engineering that reduces target prediction range, simplifying the
learning task; (2) physics-guided regularization of transport spectra to
improve generalization under sparse data; and (3) Bayesian Active Learning
(BAL) to strategically select training samples based on model uncertainty,
reducing data requirements while maintaining accuracy. Our approach achieves
superior performance with significantly less training data. In offline
settings, TGLF-SINN reduces logarithmic root mean squared error (LRMSE) by 12.
4\% compared to the current baseline \base. Using only 25\% of the complete
dataset with BAL, we achieve LRMSE only 0.0165 higher than \base~and 0.0248
higher than our offline model (0.0583). In downstream flux matching
applications, our NN surrogate provides 45x speedup over TGLF while maintaining
comparable accuracy, demonstrating potential for training efficient surrogates
for higher-fidelity models where data acquisition is costly and sparse.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in existing piano transcription models for real-time musical applications, achieving delays below 30ms.

Method: Adapt state-of-the-art online piano transcription models by removing non-causal components, reducing computational load, exploring preprocessing/postprocessing strategies, and alternative label encoding schemes.

Result: Accuracy reduction due to causal adjustments, finding a trade-off between latency and prediction accuracy when evaluated on the MAESTRO dataset.

Conclusion: The paper provides a baseline system to encourage further research on achieving minimal latency real-time transcription systems.

Abstract: Advances in neural network design and the availability of large-scale labeled
datasets have driven major improvements in piano transcription. Existing
approaches target either offline applications, with no restrictions on
computational demands, or online transcription, with delays of 128-320 ms.
However, most real-time musical applications require latencies below 30 ms. In
this work, we investigate whether and how the current state-of-the-art online
transcription model can be adapted for real-time piano transcription.
Specifically, we eliminate all non-causal processing, and reduce computational
load through shared computations across core model components and variations in
model size. Additionally, we explore different pre- and postprocessing
strategies, and related label encoding schemes, and discuss their suitability
for real-time transcription. Evaluating the adaptions on the MAESTRO dataset,
we find a drop in transcription accuracy due to strictly causal processing as
well as a tradeoff between the preprocessing latency and prediction accuracy.
We release our system as a baseline to support researchers in designing models
towards minimum latency real-time transcription.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in multivariate time series is crucial to ensure the
quality of data coming from a physics experiment. Accurately identifying the
moments when unexpected errors or defects occur is essential, yet challenging
due to scarce labels, unknown anomaly types, and complex correlations across

Motivation: Simulated labeled data for supervised ML in HEP often mismodel real-world collisions, causing domain shift issues. The authors aim to mitigate these issues.

Method: The authors develop RINO, leveraging self-supervised learning to pretrain models on collision data, using embeddings invariant to renormalization flow scales. Transformers are used as the model architecture.

Result: The pretrained model (RINO) on experimental-like QCD data showed improved generalization in identifying top quark decay jets when fine-tuned on simulated data.

Conclusion: RINO pretraining on real collision data enhances robustness and generalization for ML models in HEP, showing promise for reducing dependence on mismodeled simulated datasets.

Abstract: A common challenge with supervised machine learning (ML) in high energy
physics (HEP) is the reliance on simulations for labeled data, which can often
mismodel the underlying collision or detector response. To help mitigate this
problem of domain shift, we propose RINO (Renormalization Group Invariance with
No Labels), a self-supervised learning approach that can instead pretrain
models directly on collision data, learning embeddings invariant to
renormalization group flow scales. In this work, we pretrain a
transformer-based model on jets originating from quantum chromodynamic (QCD)
interactions from the JetClass dataset, emulating real QCD-dominated
experimental data, and then finetune on the JetNet dataset -- emulating
simulations -- for the task of identifying jets originating from top quark
decays. RINO demonstrates improved generalization from the JetNet training data
to JetClass data compared to supervised training on JetNet from scratch,
demonstrating the potential for RINO pretraining on real collision data
followed by fine-tuning on small, high-quality MC datasets, to improve the

TL;DR: This paper introduces sigma-counting, a method leveraging sigma-algebra to improve privacy-preserving counting query accuracy while accommodating numerous queries and maintaining privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in traditional noisy counting methods, such as restricted query numbers, reduced accuracy, and inconsistent total order for nested queries.

Method: Sigma-counting employs sigma-algebra to construct privacy-preserving counting mechanisms that improve accuracy and handle massive and time-varying datasets.

Result: Sigma-counting enhances output accuracy and privacy preservation, especially under large-scale and evolving data scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively manages challenges in privacy-preserving counting queries, offering improved accuracy and robustness for practical applications.

Abstract: Many data applications involve counting queries, where a client specifies a
feasible range of variables and a database returns the corresponding item
counts. A program that produces the counts of different queries often risks
leaking sensitive individual-level information. A popular approach to enhance
data privacy is to return a noisy version of the actual count. It is typically
achieved by adding independent noise to each query and then control the total
privacy budget within a period. This approach may be limited in the number of
queries and output accuracy in practice. Also, the returned counts do not
maintain the total order for nested queries, an important feature in many
applications. This work presents the design and analysis of a new method,
sigma-counting, that addresses these challenges. Sigma-counting uses the notion
of sigma-algebra to construct privacy-preserving counting queries. We show that
the proposed concepts and methods can significantly improve output accuracy
while maintaining a desired privacy level in the presence of massive queries to
the same data. We also discuss how the technique can be applied to address
large and time-varying datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ATP systems using classical binary resolution are limited in their reasoning capabilities, necessitating a new approach to make deduction systems more expressive and reliable.

Method: The study investigates systematic construction methods for two forms of standard contradictions and proposes procedures to determine satisfiability and unsatisfiability. Formulas were derived to calculate standard sub-contradictions.

Result: The research outlines the structures and methods for constructing standard contradictions, along with formulas for analyzing their embedded sub-contradictions, thus broadening deductive capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed methods advance contradiction-separation-based deduction, which enhances the transparency and reliability of automated reasoning systems beyond classical binary resolution limitations.

Abstract: Trustworthy AI requires reasoning systems that are not only powerful but also
transparent and reliable. Automated Theorem Proving (ATP) is central to formal
reasoning, yet classical binary resolution remains limited, as each step
involves only two clauses and eliminates at most two literals. To overcome this
bottleneck, the concept of standard contradiction and the theory of
contradiction-separation-based deduction were introduced in 2018. This paper
advances that framework by focusing on the systematic construction of standard
contradictions. Specially, this study investigates construction methods for two
principal forms of standard contradiction: the maximum triangular standard
contradiction and the triangular-type standard contradiction. Building on these
structures, we propose a procedure for determining the satisfiability and
unsatisfiability of clause sets via maximum standard contradiction.
Furthermore, we derive formulas for computing the number of standard
sub-contradictions embedded within both the maximum triangular standard
contradiction and the triangular-type standard contradiction. The results
presented herein furnish the methodological basis for advancing
contradiction-separation-based dynamic multi-clause automated deduction,
thereby extending the expressive and deductive capabilities of automated
reasoning systems beyond the classical binary paradigm.

Motivation: Current envelope methods improve estimation efficiency but largely rely on restrictive parametric frameworks. This paper aims to address the need for a flexible, nonparametric approach.

Method: The paper proposes the kernel envelope (KENV) estimator that utilizes RKHS with a novel penalty tailored for the envelope structure.

Result: KENV is shown to achieve lower in-sample prediction risk compared to kernel ridge regression and delivers superior prediction accuracy in simulations and real data examples.

Conclusion: KENV effectively extends envelope methods to nonparametric settings, providing improved prediction performance in various dimensions.

Abstract: Envelope methods improve the estimation efficiency in multivariate linear
regression by identifying and separating the material and immaterial parts of
the responses or the predictors and estimating the regression coefficients
using only the material part. Though envelopes have been extended to other
models, such as GLMs, these extensions still largely fall under the restrictive
parametric modeling framework. In this paper, we introduce a flexible,
nonparametric extension of response envelopes for improving efficiency in
nonlinear multivariate regressions. We propose the kernel envelope (KENV)
estimator for simultaneously estimating the response envelope subspace and the
enveloped nonparametric conditional mean function in a reproducing kernel
Hilbert space, with a novel penalty that accounts for the envelope structure.
We prove that the prediction risk for KENV converges to the optimal risk as the
sample size diverges and show that KENV achieves a lower in-sample prediction
risk than kernel ridge regression when the response has a non-trivial
immaterial component. We compare the prediction performance of KENV with other
envelope methods and kernel regression methods in simulations and a real data
example, finding that KENV delivers more accurate predictions than both the
envelope-based and kernel-based alternatives in both low and high dimensions.

### [336] [Bayesian Pliable Lasso with Horseshoe Prior for Interaction Effects in GLMs with Missing Responses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07501)
*The Tien Mai*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Bayesian extension to the pliable lasso, applying sparsity-inducing priors to identify interaction structures in regression problems, supporting uncertainty quantification and heredity constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sparse regression tools like the pliable lasso efficiently model interactions but lack frameworks for uncertainty quantification and incorporating prior knowledge.

Method: The authors propose a Bayesian pliable lasso with a hierarchical prior structure using horseshoe priors for main and interaction effects. The approach includes a Gibbs sampling algorithm for posterior inference and extends to handle missing responses in GLMs.

Result: The Bayesian framework provides sparse, interpretable interaction models and measures of uncertainty, outperforming existing methods in identifying complex interaction patterns in both complete and incomplete data.

Conclusion: The proposed Bayesian pliable lasso offers a flexible and principled tool for sparse regression, enhancing interpretability and handling missing data. A software implementation is provided.

Abstract: Sparse regression problems, where the goal is to identify a small set of
relevant predictors, often require modeling not only main effects but also
meaningful interactions through other variables. While the pliable lasso has
emerged as a powerful frequentist tool for modeling such interactions under
strong heredity constraints, it lacks a natural framework for uncertainty
quantification and incorporation of prior knowledge. In this paper, we propose
a Bayesian pliable lasso that extends this approach by placing
sparsity-inducing priors, such as the horseshoe, on both main and interaction
effects. The hierarchical prior structure enforces heredity constraints while
adaptively shrinking irrelevant coefficients and allowing important effects to
persist. We extend this framework to Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) and
develop a tailored approach to handle missing responses. To facilitate
posterior inference, we develop an efficient Gibbs sampling algorithm based on
a reparameterization of the horseshoe prior. Our Bayesian framework yields
sparse, interpretable interaction structures, and principled measures of
uncertainty. Through simulations and real-data studies, we demonstrate its
advantages over existing methods in recovering complex interaction patterns
under both complete and incomplete data.
  Our method is implemented in the package \texttt{hspliable} available on
Github.

### [337] [Individual utilities of life satisfaction reveal inequality aversion unrelated to political alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07793)
*Crispin Cooper,Ana Friedrich,Tommaso Reggiani,Wouter Poortinga*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: The study reveals that people prioritize fairness in societal well-being over personal risks, challenging traditional metrics like average life satisfaction in policy and advocating for alternatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand societal priorities in well-being and trade-offs between fairness and personal welfare.

Method: Conducted a stated preference experiment with 300 UK participants using an Expected Utility Maximisation framework, incorporating aspects of Cumulative Prospect Theory.

Result: Participants demonstrated risk-averse utility curves and a stronger preference for fairness than political affiliation, suggesting universal values.

Conclusion: Traditional well-being metrics in policy need revisiting, favoring utility-based models reflecting shared human values for fairness and equality.

Abstract: How should well-being be prioritised in society, and what trade-offs are
people willing to make between fairness and personal well-being? We investigate
these questions using a stated preference experiment with a nationally
representative UK sample (n = 300), in which participants evaluated life
satisfaction outcomes for both themselves and others under conditions of
uncertainty. Individual-level utility functions were estimated using an
Expected Utility Maximisation (EUM) framework and tested for sensitivity to the
overweighting of small probabilities, as characterised by Cumulative Prospect
Theory (CPT). A majority of participants displayed concave (risk-averse)
utility curves and showed stronger aversion to inequality in societal life
satisfaction outcomes than to personal risk. These preferences were unrelated
to political alignment, suggesting a shared normative stance on fairness in
well-being that cuts across ideological boundaries. The results challenge use
of average life satisfaction as a policy metric, and support the development of
nonlinear utility-based alternatives that more accurately reflect collective
human values. Implications for public policy, well-being measurement, and the
design of value-aligned AI systems are discussed.

TL;DR: Smart Fast Finish (SFF) improves budget pacing systems by dynamically adjusting key parameters, offering more effective and reliable management of advertising budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address inefficiencies in traditional budget pacing systems, particularly in preventing overdelivery and optimizing ad campaigns.

Method: SFF refines the Fast Finish (FF) approach by dynamically updating system parameters like start time and throttle rate based on historical ad-campaign data.

Result: SFF has been validated through online budget-split experiments and offline simulations, demonstrating its efficacy and robustness in mitigating overdelivery during pacing.

Conclusion: The successful implementation of SFF at DoorDash highlights its practical value in budget pacing systems, ensuring better ad spend management and campaign performance.

Abstract: We present a budget pacing feature called Smart Fast Finish (SFF). SFF builds
upon the industry standard Fast Finish (FF) feature in budget pacing systems
that depletes remaining advertising budget as quickly as possible towards the
end of some fixed time period. SFF dynamically updates system parameters such
as start time and throttle rate depending on historical ad-campaign data. SFF
is currently in use at DoorDash, one of the largest delivery platforms in the
US, and is part of its budget pacing system. We show via online budget-split
experimentation data and offline simulations that SFF is a robust solution for
overdelivery mitigation when pacing budget.

TL;DR: Falcon3-Audio integrates audio processing into language models with minimal data, achieving competitive performance in audio-language tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and enhance the integration of audio into language models, addressing its potential in human communication.

Method: Used instruction-tuned LLMs combined with Whisper audio encoders, leveraging under 30K hours of public audio data for single-stage training.

Result: Falcon3-Audio models achieve comparable or better performance than larger models, showing data and parameter efficiency.

Conclusion: Audio-language models can be developed effectively without excessive data or complex model structures, paving the way for efficient multimodal AI systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed NLP, yet their integration with
audio remains underexplored -- despite audio's centrality to human
communication. We introduce Falcon3-Audio, a family of Audio-Language Models
(ALMs) built on instruction-tuned LLMs and Whisper encoders. Using a remarkably
small amount of public audio data -- less than 30K hours (5K unique) --
Falcon3-Audio-7B matches the best reported performance among open-weight models
on the MMAU benchmark, with a score of 64.14, matching R1-AQA, while
distinguishing itself through superior data and parameter efficiency,
single-stage training, and transparency. Notably, our smallest 1B model remains
competitive with larger open models ranging from 2B to 13B parameters. Through
extensive ablations, we find that common complexities -- such as curriculum
learning, multiple audio encoders, and intricate cross-attention connectors --
are not required for strong performance, even compared to models trained on
over 500K hours of data.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an SVS method enabling precise user-driven control of dynamics, aiming to enhance musical expressiveness by conditioning the model on energy sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SVS systems have limitations in controlling attributes such as dynamics and expressiveness.

Method: The authors explicitly condition the SVS model on ground-truth energy sequences and propose phoneme-level energy control for user-friendly dynamics customization.

Result: Experiments showed over 50% improvement in energy accuracy without losing synthesis quality.

Conclusion: The proposed approach improves controllability and accuracy for user-driven SVS dynamics expressions, offering better expressive control.

Abstract: Controllable Singing Voice Synthesis (SVS) aims to generate expressive
singing voices reflecting user intent. While recent SVS systems achieve high
audio quality, most rely on probabilistic modeling, limiting precise control
over attributes such as dynamics. We address this by focusing on dynamic
control--temporal loudness variation essential for musical expressiveness--and
explicitly condition the SVS model on energy sequences extracted from
ground-truth spectrograms, reducing annotation costs and improving
controllability. We also propose a phoneme-level energy sequence for
user-friendly control. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt
enabling user-driven dynamics control in SVS. Experiments show our method
achieves over 50% reduction in mean absolute error of energy sequences for
phoneme-level inputs compared to baseline and energy-predictor models, without
compromising synthesis quality.

*Kutub Uddin,Muhammad Umar Farooq,Awais Khan,Khalid Mahmood Malik*

TL;DR: Generative AI can create convincing deepfake audio, threatening voice biometric systems. Current detection methods struggle against anti-forensic attacks. This paper evaluates existing methods' strengths and vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of generative AI deepfakes threatens voice biometrics, necessitating effective detection systems. Current methods face challenges from anti-forensic attacks, which compromise their effectiveness.

Method: The paper conducts a comparative analysis of state-of-the-art audio deepfake detection methods on five benchmark datasets, categorizing them into raw and spectrogram-based approaches to identify their strengths and limitations.

Result: The evaluation reveals the vulnerabilities of current detection methods against diverse anti-forensic attacks, highlighting gaps in existing defenses.

Conclusion: This study underscores the need for more robust and adaptive deepfake detection systems, providing insights for future research on defense strategies against advanced anti-forensic techniques.

Abstract: The widespread use of generative AI has shown remarkable success in producing
highly realistic deepfakes, posing a serious threat to various voice biometric
applications, including speaker verification, voice biometrics, audio
conferencing, and criminal investigations. To counteract this, several
state-of-the-art (SoTA) audio deepfake detection (ADD) methods have been
proposed to identify generative AI signatures to distinguish between real and
deepfake audio. However, the effectiveness of these methods is severely
undermined by anti-forensic (AF) attacks that conceal generative signatures.
These AF attacks span a wide range of techniques, including statistical
modifications (e.g., pitch shifting, filtering, noise addition, and
quantization) and optimization-based attacks (e.g., FGSM, PGD, C \& W, and
DeepFool). In this paper, we investigate the SoTA ADD methods and provide a
comparative analysis to highlight their effectiveness in exposing deepfake
signatures, as well as their vulnerabilities under adversarial conditions. We
conducted an extensive evaluation of ADD methods on five deepfake benchmark
datasets using two categories: raw and spectrogram-based approaches. This
comparative analysis enables a deeper understanding of the strengths and
limitations of SoTA ADD methods against diverse AF attacks. It does not only
highlight vulnerabilities of ADD methods, but also informs the design of more
robust and generalized detectors for real-world voice biometrics. It will
further guide future research in developing adaptive defense strategies that
can effectively counter evolving AF techniques.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper introduces Typman-KWS (TKWS), a lightweight neural network architecture optimized for keyword spotting on microcontroller units (MCUs). It evaluates neural network architectures across the entire processing pipeline and highlights the importance of hardware-specific optimizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of deploying efficient keyword spotting models for hands-free interaction in embedded and IoT devices, considering their strict memory and energy constraints.

Method: The study compares state-of-the-art neural networks (DS-CNN, LiCoNet, TENet) with the proposed TKWS architecture, evaluates the entire processing pipeline (from MFCC feature extraction to inference), and benchmarks performance across three STM32 platforms.

Result: The TKWS architecture achieves a high F1-score (92.4%) with a compact model (14.4k parameters) and demonstrates superior energy and latency performance on specific MCU platforms like the N6.

Conclusion: Efficient keyword spotting requires more than just accurate models; it necessitates tailored feature extraction and hardware-specific optimizations for real-world effectiveness.

Abstract: Keyword spotting (KWS) is a key enabling technology for hands-free
interaction in embedded and IoT devices, where stringent memory and energy
constraints challenge the deployment of AI-enabeld devices. In this work, we
systematically evaluate and compare several state-of-the-art lightweight neural
network architectures, including DS-CNN, LiCoNet, and TENet, alongside our
proposed Typman-KWS (TKWS) architecture built upon MobileNet, specifically
designed for efficient KWS on microcontroller units (MCUs). Unlike prior
studies focused solely on model inference, our analysis encompasses the entire
processing pipeline, from Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) feature
extraction to neural inference, and is benchmarked across three STM32 platforms
(N6, H7, and U5). Our results show that TKWS with three residual blocks
achieves up to 92.4% F1-score with only 14.4k parameters, reducing memory
footprint without compromising the accuracy. Moreover, the N6 MCU with
integrated neural acceleration achieves the best energy-delay product (EDP),
enabling efficient, low-latency operation even with high-resolution features.
Our findings highlight the model accuracy alone does not determine real-world
effectiveness; rather, optimal keyword spotting deployments require careful
consideration of feature extraction parameters and hardware-specific
optimization.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the effectiveness of various spectral and rhythm features for audio classification using deep CNNs, finding mel-scaled spectrograms and MFCC most effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve audio data classification by investigating the performance of various input features for deep CNNs.

Method: It employs an end-to-end deep learning pipeline with deep CNNs, evaluating features on the ESC-50 dataset using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Result: Mel-scaled spectrograms and MFCC features achieved significantly better performance compared to other features such as chromagrams and tempograms.

Conclusion: Mel-scaled spectrograms and MFCC should be preferred for audio classification tasks using deep CNNs due to their superior effectiveness.

Abstract: Next to decision tree and k-nearest neighbours algorithms deep convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) are widely used to classify audio data in many domains
like music, speech or environmental sounds. To train a specific CNN various
spectral and rhythm features like mel-scaled spectrograms, mel-frequency
cepstral coefficients (MFCC), cyclic tempograms, short-time Fourier transform
(STFT) chromagrams, constant-Q transform (CQT) chromagrams and chroma energy
normalized statistics (CENS) chromagrams can be used as digital image input
data for the neural network. The performance of these spectral and rhythm
features for audio category level as well as audio class level classification
is investigated in detail with a deep CNN and the ESC-50 dataset with 2,000
labeled environmental audio recordings using an end-to-end deep learning
pipeline. The evaluated metrics accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score for
multiclass classification clearly show that the mel-scaled spectrograms and the
mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) perform significantly better then
the other spectral and rhythm features investigated in this research for audio
classification tasks using deep CNNs.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to approximate synthesizers for automatic programming, enabling more efficient model training despite synthesizers being non-differentiable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automatic Synthesizer Programming (ASP) has potential to assist musicians and sound designers, but its integration with software synthesizers is limited by non-differentiability.

Method: The authors propose training a neural network to map synthesizer presets to audio embeddings derived from a pretrained model, enabling neural proxies that integrate audio embedding loss into ASP systems.

Result: Encouraging outcomes were achieved using neural proxies with both synthetic and hand-crafted presets from three software synthesizers, demonstrating usability in sound matching tasks.

Conclusion: The method enables synthesis approximation and representation learning for ASP, showing promise for further research into neural-based ASP with non-differentiable audio synthesizers.

Abstract: Deep learning appears as an appealing solution for Automatic Synthesizer
Programming (ASP), which aims to assist musicians and sound designers in
programming sound synthesizers. However, integrating software synthesizers into
training pipelines is challenging due to their potential non-differentiability.
This work tackles this challenge by introducing a method to approximate
arbitrary synthesizers. Specifically, we train a neural network to map
synthesizer presets onto an audio embedding space derived from a pretrained
model. This facilitates the definition of a neural proxy that produces compact
yet effective representations, thereby enabling the integration of audio
embedding loss into neural-based ASP systems for black-box synthesizers. We
evaluate the representations derived by various pretrained audio models in the
context of neural-based nASP and assess the effectiveness of several neural
network architectures, including feedforward, recurrent, and transformer-based
models, in defining neural proxies. We evaluate the proposed method using both
synthetic and hand-crafted presets from three popular software synthesizers and
assess its performance in a synthesizer sound matching downstream task. While
the benefits of the learned representation are nuanced by resource
requirements, encouraging results were obtained for all synthesizers, paving
the way for future research into the application of synthesizer proxies for
neural-based ASP systems.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Voice Authentication Systems (VAS) face vulnerabilities to adaptive adversarial attacks like SMIA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate vulnerabilities in VAS due to advancements in voice cloning and adversarial attack techniques.

Method: Proposing the Spectral Masking and Interpolation Attack (SMIA), which manipulates inaudible frequency regions of AI-generated audio.

Result: SMIA achieved high success rates: 82% against combined VAS/CM systems, 97.5% against standalone systems, and 100% against countermeasures.

Conclusion: Current VAS security measures are inadequate against advanced threats, necessitating a shift towards dynamic, context-aware defenses.

Abstract: Voice Authentication Systems (VAS) use unique vocal characteristics for
verification. They are increasingly integrated into high-security sectors such
as banking and healthcare. Despite their improvements using deep learning, they
face severe vulnerabilities from sophisticated threats like deepfakes and
adversarial attacks. The emergence of realistic voice cloning complicates
detection, as systems struggle to distinguish authentic from synthetic audio.
While anti-spoofing countermeasures (CMs) exist to mitigate these risks, many
rely on static detection models that can be bypassed by novel adversarial
methods, leaving a critical security gap. To demonstrate this vulnerability, we
propose the Spectral Masking and Interpolation Attack (SMIA), a novel method
that strategically manipulates inaudible frequency regions of AI-generated
audio. By altering the voice in imperceptible zones to the human ear, SMIA
creates adversarial samples that sound authentic while deceiving CMs. We
conducted a comprehensive evaluation of our attack against state-of-the-art
(SOTA) models across multiple tasks, under simulated real-world conditions.
SMIA achieved a strong attack success rate (ASR) of at least 82% against
combined VAS/CM systems, at least 97.5% against standalone speaker verification
systems, and 100% against countermeasures. These findings conclusively
demonstrate that current security postures are insufficient against adaptive
adversarial attacks. This work highlights the urgent need for a paradigm shift
toward next-generation defenses that employ dynamic, context-aware frameworks
capable of evolving with the threat landscape.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To make computational costs manageable in statistical learning tasks requiring similarity measures for probability distributions on path space.

Method: Extended previous theoretical tools and PDE methods to derive a system for calculating expected signatures, particularly leveraging extended tensor algebra for Lévy processes.

Result: Demonstrated that the expected signature kernel for Gaussian martingales satisfies a specific Goursat PDE, advancing understanding of such stochastic processes.

Conclusion: The work enables more efficient computation of expected signature kernels, facilitating their application in statistical learning and mathematical finance.

Abstract: The expected signature kernel arises in statistical learning tasks as a
similarity measure of probability measures on path space. Computing this kernel
for known classes of stochastic processes is an important problem that, in
particular, can help reduce computational costs. Building on the representation
of the expected signature of (inhomogeneous) L\'evy processes with absolutely
continuous characteristics as the development of an absolutely continuous path
in the extended tensor algebra [F.-H.-Tapia, Forum of Mathematics: Sigma
(2022), "Unified signature cumulants and generalized Magnus expansions"], we
extend the arguments developed for smooth rough paths in
[Lemercier-Lyons-Salvi, "Log-PDE Methods for Rough Signature Kernels"] to
derive a PDE system for the expected signature of inhomogeneous L\'evy
processes. As a specific example, we see that the expected signature kernel of
Gaussian martingales satisfies a Goursat PDE.
