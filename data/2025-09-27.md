### [1] [An Approach to Checking Correctness for Agentic Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20364)
*Thomas J Sheffler*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new temporal expression language to systematically monitor and detect errors in AI agents, especially those using large language models (LLMs), by focusing on action sequences rather than textual variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current error-detection methods for LLM-based agents are fragile as they rely on text matching, which struggles with the natural variability in LLM outputs. A systematic and robust monitoring tool is needed as these systems are increasingly applied in critical scenarios.

Method: The authors leverage temporal logic techniques from hardware verification to monitor AI agent behavior by analyzing execution traces of tool calls and state transitions. Assertions in a temporal expression language are crafted to capture correct behaviors, verified across different scenarios.

Result: The method was tested on a three-agent system solving multi-step reasoning tasks. While large models adhered to behavioral patterns across scenarios, smaller models violated assertions due to tool sequencing errors and coordination failures. The temporal language flagged these issues reliably.

Conclusion: This temporal expression language proves effective for detecting behavioral regressions and provides a useful framework for systematically validating and monitoring AI agent reliability, facilitating safer deployment in critical settings.

Abstract: This paper presents a temporal expression language for monitoring AI agent
behavior, enabling systematic error-detection of LLM-based agentic systems that
exhibit variable outputs due to stochastic generation processes. Drawing from
temporal logic techniques used in hardware verification, this approach monitors
execution traces of agent tool calls and state transitions to detect deviations
from expected behavioral patterns. Current error-detection approaches rely
primarily on text matching of inputs and outputs, which proves fragile due to
the natural language variability inherent in LLM responses. The proposed method
instead focuses on the sequence of agent actions -- such as tool invocations
and inter-agent communications -- allowing verification of system behavior
independent of specific textual outputs. The temporal expression language
provides assertions that capture correct behavioral patterns across multiple
execution scenarios. These assertions serve dual purposes: validating prompt
engineering and guardrail effectiveness during development, and providing
regression testing when agents are updated with new LLMs or modified logic. The
approach is demonstrated using a three-agent system, where agents coordinate to
solve multi-step reasoning tasks. When powered by large, capable models, all
temporal assertions were satisfied across many test runs. However, when smaller
models were substituted in two of the three agents, executions violated
behavioral assertions, primarily due to improper tool sequencing and failed
coordination handoffs. The temporal expressions successfully flagged these
anomalies, demonstrating the method's effectiveness for detecting behavioral
regressions in production agentic systems. This approach provides a foundation
for systematic monitoring of AI agent reliability as these systems become
increasingly deployed in critical applications.

### [2] [LATTS: Locally Adaptive Test-Time Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20368)
*Theo Uscidda,Matthew Trager,Michael Kleinman,Aditya Chattopadhyay,Wei Xia,Stefano Soatto*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Locally Adaptive Test-Time Scaling (LATTS) to improve computation efficiency while maintaining accuracy for Large Language Models (LLMs) by adjusting compute resources based on local difficulty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing verifier-based methods improve LLM accuracy but inefficiently allocate compute uniformly across tasks and steps, leading to resource wastage.

Method: LATTS dynamically adjusts computational effort during generation by using a verifier-based acceptance criterion to decide on resampling, backtracking, restarting, or stopping, based on local difficulty.

Result: Empirical results demonstrate that LATTS outperforms standard methods in the accuracy-computation tradeoff.

Conclusion: LATTS offers a more efficient and effective approach to test-time scaling, optimizing computational resource use per instance while maintaining performance.

Abstract: One common strategy for improving the performance of Large Language Models
(LLMs) on downstream tasks involves using a \emph{verifier model} to either
select the best answer from a pool of candidates or to steer the
auto-regressive generation process towards better outputs. This class of
methods typically results in improved accuracy at the cost of increased
computation at test-time, a paradigm known as \emph{test-time scaling}.
However, most existing approaches increase computation uniformly across all
samples and generation steps, without considering the complexity of individual
instances, leading to inefficient resource use. We address this limitation by
proposing an approach, called \emph{Locally Adaptive Test-Time Scaling
(LATTS)}, that allocates variable compute across generation steps.
Specifically, at each generation step, LATTS employs a verifier-based
acceptance criterion to decide whether to resample, backtrack, restart, or stop
the generation process. This criterion effectively adjusts the per-step
computational effort based on a precise notion of \emph{local difficulty}
derived from the verifier model. Empirical results show that LATTS achieves
significantly superior accuracy--compute tradeoffs compared to standard
verifier-based methods.

*MZ Naser*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Philosophy-informed machine learning (PhIML) integrates philosophical concepts and values into machine learning models, objectives, and evaluations to create new capabilities and ethical designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in integrating philosophical concepts and values into machine learning systems, ensuring ethical responsibility and alignment with philosophy.

Method: The paper reviews conceptual foundations, explores how PhIML can be used either post-hoc or intrinsically, and provides case studies while identifying challenges and proposing a research roadmap.

Result: PhIML offers enhanced alignment with philosophical principles and provides means for ethical consideration in machine learning systems. The case studies illustrate potential applications.

Conclusion: PhIML represents a pathway to develop safe, philosophy-aware, and ethically responsible machine learning models, but further research and technical advancements are needed.

Abstract: Philosophy-informed machine learning (PhIML) directly infuses core ideas from
analytic philosophy into ML model architectures, objectives, and evaluation
protocols. Therefore, PhIML promises new capabilities through models that
respect philosophical concepts and values by design. From this lens, this paper
reviews conceptual foundations to demonstrate philosophical gains and
alignment. In addition, we present case studies on how ML users/designers can
adopt PhIML as an agnostic post-hoc tool or intrinsically build it into ML
model architectures. Finally, this paper sheds light on open technical barriers
alongside philosophical, practical, and governance challenges and outlines a
research roadmap toward safe, philosophy-aware, and ethically responsible
PhIML.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: InsightGUIDE is an AI-powered reading assistant designed to provide concise, structured insights into scientific papers instead of replacing them with verbose summaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing amount of scientific literature makes it challenging for researchers to stay updated efficiently, and existing LLM tools often fail to assist optimally by providing overly detailed summaries that lead to replacement rather than enhancement.

Method: InsightGUIDE embeds an expert's reading methodology in its AI core, leveraging a prompt-driven approach to generate concise and structured insights. It is evaluated through its system architecture and by comparison to general-purpose LLMs.

Result: The system produces more structured and actionable guidance for researchers compared to general-purpose LLMs, as demonstrated in a qualitative case study.

Conclusion: InsightGUIDE serves as a more effective aid for researchers, offering a concise and structured "map" to navigate the key elements of a scientific paper without replacing the need to read the original material.

Abstract: The proliferation of scientific literature presents an increasingly
significant challenge for researchers. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer
promise, existing tools often provide verbose summaries that risk replacing,
rather than assisting, the reading of the source material. This paper
introduces InsightGUIDE, a novel AI-powered tool designed to function as a
reading assistant, not a replacement. Our system provides concise, structured
insights that act as a "map" to a paper's key elements by embedding an expert's
reading methodology directly into its core AI logic. We present the system's
architecture, its prompt-driven methodology, and a qualitative case study
comparing its output to a general-purpose LLM. The results demonstrate that
InsightGUIDE produces more structured and actionable guidance, serving as a
more effective tool for the modern researcher.

### [5] [Reconstruction-Based Adaptive Scheduling Using AI Inferences in Safety-Critical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20513)
*Samer Alshaer,Ala Khalifeh,Roman Obermaisser*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a dynamic reconstruction framework to overcome challenges in adaptive scheduling for time-triggered systems, ensuring safety, reliability, and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges like message collisions, incorrect precedence handling, and invalid schedules that compromise reliability and safety in dynamic environments.

Method: Developed a reconstruction framework that validates and transforms AI-generated or heuristic scheduling priorities into executable schedules with adherence to safety constraints, robust checks, and recovery mechanisms.

Result: Experimental evaluation shows improvements in adaptability, integrity, runtime performance, and computational efficiency across different performance metrics.

Conclusion: The framework offers a scalable and practical solution for reliable real-time scheduling in dynamic and uncertain conditions in safety-critical systems.

Abstract: Adaptive scheduling is crucial for ensuring the reliability and safety of
time-triggered systems (TTS) in dynamic operational environments. Scheduling
frameworks face significant challenges, including message collisions, locked
loops from incorrect precedence handling, and the generation of incomplete or
invalid schedules, which can compromise system safety and performance. To
address these challenges, this paper presents a novel reconstruction framework
designed to dynamically validate and assemble schedules. The proposed
reconstruction models operate by systematically transforming AI-generated or
heuristically derived scheduling priorities into fully executable schedules,
ensuring adherence to critical system constraints such as precedence rules and
collision-free communication. It incorporates robust safety checks, efficient
allocation algorithms, and recovery mechanisms to handle unexpected context
events, including hardware failures and mode transitions. Comprehensive
experiments were conducted across multiple performance profiles, including
makespan minimisation, workload balancing, and energy efficiency, to validate
the operational effectiveness of the reconstruction models. Results demonstrate
that the proposed framework significantly enhances system adaptability,
operational integrity, and runtime performance while maintaining computational
efficiency. Overall, this work contributes a practical and scalable solution to
the problem of safe schedule generation in safety-critical TTS, enabling
reliable and flexible real-time scheduling even under highly dynamic and
uncertain operational conditions.

### [6] [Adaptive Approach to Enhance Machine Learning Scheduling Algorithms During Runtime Using Reinforcement Learning in Metascheduling Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20520)
*Samer Alshaer,Ala Khalifeh,Roman Obermaisser*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces an online adaptive learning unit for metaschedulers in time-triggered systems, leveraging Reinforcement Learning to improve real-time scheduling, extend Multi-Schedule Graphs, and address dynamic, safety-critical scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional offline methods for training AI scheduling are limited due to the complexity and resource-intensive nature of capturing all possible scenarios in a Multi-Schedule Graph (MSG). This limitation hinders the system's adaptability to dynamic, unpredictable environments.

Method: The paper proposes integrating an adaptive online learning unit into the metascheduler, utilizing Reinforcement Learning models to dynamically explore and refine scheduling solutions. This approach enables continuous MSG expansion and optimization in real time.

Result: The online learning unit successfully enhances real-time scheduling by addressing unexpected events, meeting stricter deadlines, and adapting to complex performance criteria. This leads to improved system flexibility and robustness.

Conclusion: By incorporating online RL-based training, the system achieves superior adaptability and efficiency, making it well-suited for large-scale, safety-critical environments requiring dynamic scheduling adjustments.

Abstract: Metascheduling in time-triggered architectures has been crucial in adapting
to dynamic and unpredictable environments, ensuring the reliability and
efficiency of task execution. However, traditional approaches face significant
challenges when training Artificial Intelligence (AI) scheduling inferences
offline, particularly due to the complexities involved in constructing a
comprehensive Multi-Schedule Graph (MSG) that accounts for all possible
scenarios. The process of generating an MSG that captures the vast probability
space, especially when considering context events like hardware failures, slack
variations, or mode changes, is resource-intensive and often infeasible. To
address these challenges, we propose an adaptive online learning unit
integrated within the metascheduler to enhance performance in real-time. The
primary motivation for developing this unit stems from the limitations of
offline training, where the MSG created is inherently a subset of the complete
space, focusing only on the most probable and critical context events. In the
online mode, Reinforcement Learning (RL) plays a pivotal role by continuously
exploring and discovering new scheduling solutions, thus expanding the MSG and
enhancing system performance over time. This dynamic adaptation allows the
system to handle unexpected events and complex scheduling scenarios more
effectively. Several RL models were implemented within the online learning
unit, each designed to address specific challenges in scheduling. These models
not only facilitate the discovery of new solutions but also optimize existing
schedulers, particularly when stricter deadlines or new performance criteria
are introduced. By continuously refining the AI inferences through real-time
training, the system remains flexible and capable of meeting evolving demands,
thus ensuring robustness and efficiency in large-scale, safety-critical
environments.

### [7] [A Compound Classification System Based on Fuzzy Relations Applied to the Noise-Tolerant Control of a Bionic Hand via EMG Signal Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20523)
*Pawel Trajdos,Marek Kurzynski*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper focuses on improving the control system of upper limb prostheses by addressing the issue of biosignal contamination. This is achieved using a novel fuzzy recognition model comprising one-class classifiers (OCC) and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifiers for better EMG control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the functionality of anthropomorphic upper limb prostheses, the paper aims to reduce the negative impact of biosignal contamination on electromyographic (EMG) biosignal classification quality, a known challenge in accurate prosthesis control.

Method: The proposed system combines two classifier ensembles: one-class classifiers (OCC) to assess contamination in biosignals, and K-nearest neighbors (KNN) to interpret the user's intent. The approach uses a unified fuzzy model for soft decision-making throughout the recognition process.

Result: Experimental analysis was conducted using real biosignal data from a public repository. The evaluation showed how parameters and procedures impacted the system's performance. The new system was benchmarked against similar existing systems.

Conclusion: The fuzzy recognition system developed in the study successfully addressed biosignal contamination and demonstrated improved classification quality for EMG-based prosthesis control compared to systems in existing literature.

Abstract: Modern anthropomorphic upper limb bioprostheses are typically controlled by
electromyographic (EMG) biosignals using a pattern recognition scheme.
Unfortunately, there are many factors originating from the human source of
objects to be classified and from the human-prosthesis interface that make it
difficult to obtain an acceptable classification quality. One of these factors
is the high susceptibility of biosignals to contamination, which can
considerably reduce the quality of classification of a recognition system.
  In the paper, the authors propose a new recognition system intended for EMG
based control of the hand prosthesis with detection of contaminated biosignals
in order to mitigate the adverse effect of contaminations. The system consists
of two ensembles: the set of one-class classifiers (OCC) to assess the degree
of contamination of individual channels and the ensemble of K-nearest
neighbours (KNN) classifier to recognise the patient's intent. For all
recognition systems, an original, coherent fuzzy model was developed, which
allows the use of a uniform soft (fuzzy) decision scheme throughout the
recognition process. The experimental evaluation was conducted using real
biosignals from a public repository. The goal was to provide an experimental
comparative analysis of the parameters and procedures of the developed method
on which the quality of the recognition system depends. The proposed fuzzy
recognition system was also compared with similar systems described in the
literature.

### [8] [SAMULE: Self-Learning Agents Enhanced by Multi-level Reflection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20562)
*Yubin Ge,Salvatore Romeo,Jason Cai,Monica Sunkara,Yi Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAMULE, a framework that enhances LLM agents' self-learning via multi-level reflection synthesis, improving their performance on complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents struggle with generating meaningful reflections due to inadequate error analysis and reliance on rare successful trajectories, hindering their performance in complex tasks.

Method: Introduced SAMULE, a retrospective language model framework with multi-level reflection synthesis: micro-level for error correction, meso-level for error taxonomy development across trials of the same task, and macro-level to extract transferable insights across diverse tasks. It incorporates a foresight-based reflection mechanism for interactive adaptation.

Result: SAMULE significantly outperformed baseline methods in three benchmark tasks (TravelPlanner, NATURAL PLAN, Tau-bench) via rigorous experiments.

Conclusion: Well-designed reflection synthesis and failure-centric learning are critical for developing self-improving LLM agents, as evidenced by the proposed SAMULE framework's success.

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancements in LLM agents, they still face the challenge
of generating meaningful reflections due to inadequate error analysis and a
reliance on rare successful trajectories, especially in complex tasks. In this
work, we propose SAMULE, a new framework for self-learning agents powered by a
retrospective language model that is trained based on Multi-Level Reflection
Synthesis. It first synthesizes high-quality reflections across three
complementary levels: Single-Trajectory Learning (micro-level) for detailed
error correction; Intra-Task Learning (meso-level) to build error taxonomies
across multiple trials of the same task, and Inter-Task Learning (macro-level)
to extract transferable insights based on same typed errors from diverse task
failures. Then we fine-tune a language model serving as the retrospective model
to generate reflections during inference. We further extend our framework to
interactive settings through a foresight-based reflection mechanism, enabling
agents to proactively reflect and adapt during user interactions by comparing
predicted and actual responses. Extensive experiments on three challenging
benchmarks - TravelPlanner, NATURAL PLAN, and Tau-bench - demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms reflection-based baselines. Our results
highlight the critical role of well-designed reflection synthesis and
failure-centric learning in building self-improving LLM agents.

Method: The framework incorporates agentic AI capable of dynamic learning, context-aware decision making, behavioral baselining, decentralized risk scoring, and federated threat intelligence sharing, all tested in cloud simulations.

Result: Demonstrated capabilities include effective zero-day attack identification, dynamic policy adjustments, and enhancements in adaptability, response time, and detection accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture provides a scalable and intelligent solution for modern cybersecurity challenges, aligning with zero-trust models and supporting international regulations.

Abstract: Traditional static cybersecurity models often struggle with scalability,
real-time detection, and contextual responsiveness in the current digital
product ecosystems which include cloud services, application programming
interfaces (APIs), mobile platforms, and edge devices. This study introduces
autonomous goal driven agents capable of dynamic learning and context-aware
decision making as part of an adaptive cybersecurity architecture driven by
agentic artificial intelligence (AI). To facilitate autonomous threat
mitigation, proactive policy enforcement, and real-time anomaly detection, this
framework integrates agentic AI across the key ecosystem layers. Behavioral
baselining, decentralized risk scoring, and federated threat intelligence
sharing are important features. The capacity of the system to identify zero-day
attacks and dynamically modify access policies was demonstrated through native
cloud simulations. The evaluation results show increased adaptability,
decreased response latency, and improved detection accuracy. The architecture
provides an intelligent and scalable blueprint for safeguarding complex digital
infrastructure and is compatible with zero-trust models, thereby supporting the
adherence to international cybersecurity regulations.

### [10] [Accelerate Creation of Product Claims Using Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20652)
*Po-Yu Liang,Yong Zhang,Tatiana Hwa,Aaron Byers*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A web application named Claim Advisor was developed to enhance the efficiency of creating product benefit claims using large language models (LLM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to disrupt the speed and economics of creating product claims, an essential driver of consumer behavior, which traditionally requires significant time and funding.

Method: Claim Advisor uses in-context learning and fine-tuned LLMs for semantic searches, claim generation/optimization, and ranking via synthetic consumer simulations.

Result: The application showed promising results in consumer packaged goods, demonstrating its effectiveness in accelerating claim creation.

Conclusion: Claim Advisor's generative AI-based approach is broadly applicable across industries, encouraging further research and development in similar domains.

Abstract: The benefit claims of a product is a critical driver of consumers' purchase
behavior. Creating product claims is an intense task that requires substantial
time and funding. We have developed the $\textbf{Claim Advisor}$ web
application to accelerate claim creations using in-context learning and
fine-tuning of large language models (LLM). $\textbf{Claim Advisor}$ was
designed to disrupt the speed and economics of claim search, generation,
optimization, and simulation. It has three functions: (1) semantically
searching and identifying existing claims and/or visuals that resonate with the
voice of consumers; (2) generating and/or optimizing claims based on a product
description and a consumer profile; and (3) ranking generated and/or manually
created claims using simulations via synthetic consumers. Applications in a
consumer packaged goods (CPG) company have shown very promising results. We
believe that this capability is broadly useful and applicable across product
categories and industries. We share our learning to encourage the research and
application of generative AI in different industries.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system powered by LLaMA-4 for automated and interpretable evaluation of radiotherapy treatment plans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve radiotherapy treatment plan evaluation by developing an automated system that is protocol-aware and interpretable, addressing the need for scalable and transparent methodologies in clinical settings.

Method: A multi-protocol dataset of 614 plans is used alongside a knowledge base to integrate three core modules: a SentenceTransformer-based retrieval engine, a cohort-based percentile prediction component, and a clinical constraint checker. These are coordinated through a multi-step reasoning pipeline within an LLM framework.

Result: The optimized retrieval engine achieved high accuracy with perfect nearest-neighbor identification within a 5-percentile margin and sub-2pt error. End-to-end tests showed 100% agreement in retrieval and constraint-checking module outputs, confirming system reliability.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the feasibility of structured, population-informed scoring combined with modular reasoning tools for robust radiotherapy plan evaluation. It highlights transparency, reduced hallucination, and scalability, although clinician validation and domain-specific optimization are needed for real-world adoption.

Abstract: Purpose: To develop a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system powered by
LLaMA-4 109B for automated, protocol-aware, and interpretable evaluation of
radiotherapy treatment plans.
  Methods and Materials: We curated a multi-protocol dataset of 614
radiotherapy plans across four disease sites and constructed a knowledge base
containing normalized dose metrics and protocol-defined constraints. The RAG
system integrates three core modules: a retrieval engine optimized across five
SentenceTransformer backbones, a percentile prediction component based on
cohort similarity, and a clinical constraint checker. These tools are directed
by a large language model (LLM) using a multi-step prompt-driven reasoning
pipeline to produce concise, grounded evaluations.
  Results: Retrieval hyperparameters were optimized using Gaussian Process on a
scalarized loss function combining root mean squared error (RMSE), mean
absolute error (MAE), and clinically motivated accuracy thresholds. The best
configuration, based on all-MiniLM-L6-v2, achieved perfect nearest-neighbor
accuracy within a 5-percentile-point margin and a sub-2pt MAE. When tested
end-to-end, the RAG system achieved 100% agreement with the computed values by
standalone retrieval and constraint-checking modules on both percentile
estimates and constraint identification, confirming reliable execution of all
retrieval, prediction and checking steps.
  Conclusion: Our findings highlight the feasibility of combining structured
population-based scoring with modular tool-augmented reasoning for transparent,
scalable plan evaluation in radiation therapy. The system offers traceable
outputs, minimizes hallucination, and demonstrates robustness across protocols.
Future directions include clinician-led validation, and improved domain-adapted
retrieval models to enhance real-world integration.

### [12] [Fairy: Interactive Mobile Assistant to Real-world Tasks via LMM-based Multi-agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20729)
*Jiazheng Sun,Te Yang,Jiayang Niu,Mingxuan Li,Yongyong Lu,Ruimeng Yang,Xin Peng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Fairy, an interactive assistant for mobile apps that leverages multi-agent systems for cross-app collaboration, interactive task execution, and continual learning, outperforming existing methods significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for mobile GUI agents struggle with diverse app interfaces, evolving user needs, failure on less common apps, and lack of effective user interaction.

Method: Fairy integrates three core modules: a Global Task Planner for task decomposition across apps, an App-Level Executor for precise execution via multiple agents, and a Self-Learner for consolidating execution experience into actionable insights.

Result: Fairy improves user requirement completion by 33.7% and reduces redundant steps by 58.5%, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art using a GPT-4o backbone.

Conclusion: The interactive and self-learning capabilities of Fairy demonstrate its superiority in handling complex real-world mobile GUI tasks, contributing significantly to mobile assistant technology.

Abstract: Large multi-modal models (LMMs) have advanced mobile GUI agents. However,
existing methods struggle with real-world scenarios involving diverse app
interfaces and evolving user needs. End-to-end methods relying on model's
commonsense often fail on long-tail apps, and agents without user interaction
act unilaterally, harming user experience. To address these limitations, we
propose Fairy, an interactive multi-agent mobile assistant capable of
continuously accumulating app knowledge and self-evolving during usage. Fairy
enables cross-app collaboration, interactive execution, and continual learning
through three core modules:(i) a Global Task Planner that decomposes user tasks
into sub-tasks from a cross-app view; (ii) an App-Level Executor that refines
sub-tasks into steps and actions based on long- and short-term memory,
achieving precise execution and user interaction via four core agents operating
in dual loops; and (iii) a Self-Learner that consolidates execution experience
into App Map and Tricks. To evaluate Fairy, we introduce RealMobile-Eval, a
real-world benchmark with a comprehensive metric suite, and LMM-based agents
for automated scoring. Experiments show that Fairy with GPT-4o backbone
outperforms the previous SoTA by improving user requirement completion by 33.7%
and reducing redundant steps by 58.5%, showing the effectiveness of its
interaction and self-learning.

### [13] [Parallel Thinking, Sequential Answering: Bridging NAR and AR for Efficient Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20744)
*Qihang Ai,Haiyun Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A combined approach using autoregressive (AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) models improves reasoning tasks' performance and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance reasoning tasks in domains requiring lengthy chains of thought by addressing the slow inference of AR models and the quality loss in NAR models.

Method: Proposes integrating AR and NAR models where NAR generates intermediate reasoning traces efficiently to guide AR for the final output.

Result: The approach achieves 26% performance improvement over baselines with reduced inference costs.

Conclusion: This hybrid methodology effectively balances speed and quality in reasoning tasks.

Abstract: We study reasoning tasks through a framework that integrates auto-regressive
(AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) language models. AR models, which generate
text sequentially, excel at producing coherent outputs but often suffer from
slow inference, particularly in reasoning-intensive domains such as mathematics
and code, where lengthy chains of thought are required. In contrast, NAR
models, such as discrete diffusion models, allow parallel generation and offer
substantial speedups, though typically at the cost of reduced output quality.
To address these limitations, we introduce a new paradigm in which an NAR model
efficiently produces intermediate reasoning traces, which subsequently guide an
AR model to deliver precise final answers. Experiments demonstrate that our
approach yields significant 26% improvements over strong baselines while
substantially reducing inference cost.

Motivation: The motivation is to advance robotic capabilities for answering spatial location queries by enhancing memory storage, retrieval, and integration mechanisms, addressing a critical gap in prior research.

Method: Meta-Memory creates a dense memory representation and employs joint reasoning over semantic and spatial modalities, driven by a large language model, to process natural language spatial queries.

Result: Meta-Memory outperforms existing methods on SpaceLocQA and NaVQA benchmarks and is successfully implemented on real-world robots for navigating and querying in complex environments.

Conclusion: Meta-Memory’s ability to retrieve and integrate memories provides a significant step forward in robotic spatial reasoning, demonstrating both benchmark success and real-world applicability.

Abstract: Navigating complex environments requires robots to effectively store
observations as memories and leverage them to answer human queries about
spatial locations, which is a critical yet underexplored research challenge.
While prior work has made progress in constructing robotic memory, few have
addressed the principled mechanisms needed for efficient memory retrieval and
integration. To bridge this gap, we propose Meta-Memory, a large language model
(LLM)-driven agent that constructs a high-density memory representation of the
environment. The key innovation of Meta-Memory lies in its capacity to retrieve
and integrate relevant memories through joint reasoning over semantic and
spatial modalities in response to natural language location queries, thereby
empowering robots with robust and accurate spatial reasoning capabilities. To
evaluate its performance, we introduce SpaceLocQA, a large-scale dataset
encompassing diverse real-world spatial question-answering scenarios.
Experimental results show that Meta-Memory significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on both the SpaceLocQA and the public NaVQA
benchmarks. Furthermore, we successfully deployed Meta-Memory on real-world
robotic platforms, demonstrating its practical utility in complex environments.

### [15] [LogReasoner: Empowering LLMs with Expert-like Coarse-to-Fine Reasoning for Log Analysis Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20798)
*Lipeng Ma,Yixuan Li,Weidong Yang,Mingjie Zhou,Xinyi Liu,Ben Fei,Shuhao Li,Xiaoyan Sun,Sihang Jiang,Yanghua Xiao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces LogReasoner, a framework to enhance LLMs' reasoning ability for log analysis using a structured, expert-inspired approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve the reasoning capabilities of LLMs in automated log analysis, as general-purpose models struggle to replicate expert-level structured reasoning and task-specific details.

Method: LogReasoner operates in two stages: (1) constructing structured reasoning workflows inspired by expert troubleshooting flowcharts, and (2) fine-tuning LLMs for detailed stepwise reasoning and further refining using preference learning to improve accuracy.

Result: Experimental evaluations on four log analysis tasks demonstrate that LogReasoner-equipped LLMs outperform existing models and achieve state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: LogReasoner enhances LLMs' ability to reason and perform expert-level log analysis, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Log analysis is crucial for monitoring system health and diagnosing failures
in complex systems. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new
opportunities for automated log analysis, leveraging their reasoning
capabilities to perform tasks such as anomaly detection and failure prediction.
However, general-purpose LLMs struggle to formulate structured reasoning
workflows that align with expert cognition and deliver precise details of
reasoning steps. To address these challenges, we propose LogReasoner, a
coarse-to-fine reasoning enhancement framework designed to enable LLMs to
reason log analysis tasks like experts. LogReasoner consists of two stages: (1)
coarse-grained enhancement of expert thinking, where high-level expert thoughts
are constructed from collected troubleshooting flowcharts and existing tasks to
enable LLMs to formulate structured reasoning workflows and (2) fine-grained
enhancement of specific steps, where we first fine-tune the LLM with
task-specific stepwise solutions to enhance the LLM for instantiated reasoning,
then employ the preference learning to calibrate the LLM's reasoning details
from its mistakes, further strengthen the LLM's analytical granularity and
correctness. We evaluate LogReasoner on four distinct log analysis tasks using
open-source LLMs such as Qwen-2.5 and Llama-3. Experimental results show that
LogReasoner significantly outperforms existing LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art
performance and demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs for log analysis.

### [16] [DeFacto: Counterfactual Thinking with Images for Enforcing Evidence-Grounded and Faithful Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20912)
*Tianrun Xu,Haoda Jing,Ye Li,Yuquan Wei,Jun Feng,Guanyu Chen,Haichuan Gao,Tianren Zhang,Feng Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces DeFacto, a counterfactual reasoning framework to improve accuracy and reasoning fidelity in multimodal language models by focusing on accurate answers and evidence-grounded reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the reasoning fidelity of multimodal language models, as existing methods may generate correct answers using irrelevant or biased image regions without truly understanding the image.

Method: The paper introduces DeFacto, which employs three training paradigms (positive, counterfactual, and random-masking) and reinforcement learning with three rewards to emphasize accurate and faithful multimodal reasoning.

Result: Experiments demonstrated that DeFacto significantly improves answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness across diverse benchmarks.

Conclusion: DeFacto establishes a stronger foundation for interpretable and reliable multimodal reasoning, addressing reasoning fidelity issues in multimodal language models.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal language models (MLLMs) have achieved
remarkable progress in vision-language reasoning, especially with the emergence
of "thinking with images," which integrates explicit visual steps into the
reasoning process. While this paradigm strengthens image-based reasoning, a
significant challenge remains: models may arrive at correct answers by relying
on irrelevant or spurious regions, driven by prior knowledge or dataset biases.
Even when the answer is correct, flawed reasoning indicates that the model has
not truly understood the image, highlighting the critical importance of
reasoning fidelity in multimodal tasks. To address this issue, we propose
DeFacto, a counterfactual reasoning framework that jointly enforces accurate
answering and faithful reasoning. A key component of our approach is the design
of three complementary training paradigms: (i) positive, (ii) counterfactual,
and (iii) random-masking. To enable these paradigms, we develop a pipeline that
automatically localizes question-relevant evidence and constructs positive,
counterfactual, and random variants, resulting in a dataset of about 100k
images. Building on this framework, we train multimodal language models with
GRPO-based reinforcement learning, where we design three complementary rewards
to guide the model toward accurate answering and evidence-grounded reasoning.
Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that DeFacto substantially
improves both answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness, establishing a
stronger foundation for interpretable multimodal reasoning. The code is
available on GitHub and the dataset is released on HuggingFace.

### [17] [GALAX: Graph-Augmented Language Model for Explainable Reinforcement-Guided Subgraph Reasoning in Precision Medicine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20935)
*Heming Zhang,Di Huang,Wenyu Li,Michael Province,Yixin Chen,Philip Payne,Fuhai Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces GALAX, a framework integrating Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) into Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve disease pathway identification and target discovery in precision medicine using subgraph reasoning. A benchmark, Target-QA, validates the approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods in precision medicine fail to combine quantitative multi-omic signals, topological contexts, and textual biological knowledge comprehensively, resulting in limitations in mechanistic interpretability.

Method: The proposed GALAX framework integrates pretrained GNNs into LLMs using reinforcement guided by a Graph Process Reward Model to create disease-relevant subgraphs step-wise. Target-QA benchmark is introduced for evaluation.

Result: GALAX enables process-level supervision for graph construction without intermediate reasoning annotations, combining numeric, topological, and textual data for identifying pathways and targets.

Conclusion: GALAX demonstrates scalable, explainable reasoning capabilities for precision medicine by integrating diverse datasets and mechanism-driven subgraph reasoning, offering a robust framework for target discovery.

Abstract: In precision medicine, quantitative multi-omic features, topological context,
and textual biological knowledge play vital roles in identifying
disease-critical signaling pathways and targets. Existing pipelines capture
only part of these-numerical omics ignore topological context, text-centric
LLMs lack quantitative grounded reasoning, and graph-only models underuse node
semantics and the generalization of LLMs-limiting mechanistic interpretability.
Although Process Reward Models (PRMs) aim to guide reasoning in LLMs, they
remain limited by unreliable intermediate evaluation, and vulnerability to
reward hacking with computational cost. These gaps motivate integrating
quantitative multi-omic signals, topological structure with node annotations,
and literature-scale text via LLMs, using subgraph reasoning as the principle
bridge linking numeric evidence, topological knowledge and language context.
Therefore, we propose GALAX (Graph Augmented LAnguage model with
eXplainability), an innovative framework that integrates pretrained Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) into Large Language Models (LLMs) via reinforcement
guided by a Graph Process Reward Model (GPRM), which generates disease-relevant
subgraphs in a step-wise manner initiated by an LLM and iteratively evaluated
by a pretrained GNN, enabling process-level supervision without explicit
intermediate reasoning annotations. As an application, we also introduced
Target-QA, a benchmark combining CRISPR-identified targets, multi-omic
profiles, and biomedical graph knowledge across diverse cancer cell lines,
which enables GNN pretraining for supervising step-wise graph construction and
supports long-context reasoning over text-numeric graphs (TNGs), providing a
scalable and biologically grounded framework for explainable,
reinforcement-guided subgraph reasoning toward reliable and interpretable
target and pathway discovery in precision medicine.

*Najla Zuhir,Amna Mohammad Salim,Parvathy Premkumar,Moshiur Farazi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a modular approach using large language models (LLMs) to improve mobile app review analysis by capturing nuanced textual feedback and addressing the limitations of star-rating systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inadequacy of traditional star-rating systems and NLP methods in interpreting contextual and nuanced feedback in app reviews.

Method: The study develops a modular framework with LLMs combined with structured prompting techniques. It analyzes textual ratings, extracts feature-level insights, and integrates retrieval-augmented conversational question answering (RAG-QA).

Result: The proposed framework outperforms traditional NLP methods across three datasets, demonstrating improved accuracy, robustness, and actionable insights in understanding app reviews.

Conclusion: The LLM-driven approach provides a more nuanced, accurate, and effective analysis of app reviews, making it a valuable tool for understanding user feedback in complex contexts.

Abstract: We present an advanced approach to mobile app review analysis aimed at
addressing limitations inherent in traditional star-rating systems. Star
ratings, although intuitive and popular among users, often fail to capture the
nuanced feedback present in detailed review texts. Traditional NLP techniques
-- such as lexicon-based methods and classical machine learning classifiers --
struggle to interpret contextual nuances, domain-specific terminology, and
subtle linguistic features like sarcasm. To overcome these limitations, we
propose a modular framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) enhanced by
structured prompting techniques. Our method quantifies discrepancies between
numerical ratings and textual sentiment, extracts detailed, feature-level
insights, and supports interactive exploration of reviews through
retrieval-augmented conversational question answering (RAG-QA). Comprehensive
experiments conducted on three diverse datasets (AWARE, Google Play, and
Spotify) demonstrate that our LLM-driven approach significantly surpasses
baseline methods, yielding improved accuracy, robustness, and actionable
insights in challenging and context-rich review scenarios.

*Xiaozhuang Song,Xuanhao Pan,Xinjian Zhao,Hangting Ye,Shufei Zhang,Jian Tang,Tianshu Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces AOT*, a framework combining LLMs with AND-OR tree search for more efficient retrosynthesis planning, achieving state-of-the-art results with fewer iterations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Retrosynthesis planning is crucial for drug discovery and materials design but faces computational challenges due to large search spaces and inefficiency in current methods.

Method: The method involves integrating LLM-generated synthesis pathways with AND-OR tree search, featuring optimized reward strategies and retrieval-based context engineering.

Result: Experimental benchmarks show AOT* achieves competitive solve rates with 3-5x fewer iterations compared to existing methods, especially for complex molecules.

Conclusion: AOT* significantly improves retrosynthesis planning efficiency and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, emphasizing its potential for handling complex chemical targets.

Abstract: Retrosynthesis planning enables the discovery of viable synthetic routes for
target molecules, playing a crucial role in domains like drug discovery and
materials design. Multi-step retrosynthetic planning remains computationally
challenging due to exponential search spaces and inference costs. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate chemical reasoning capabilities, their
application to synthesis planning faces constraints on efficiency and cost. To
address these challenges, we introduce AOT*, a framework that transforms
retrosynthetic planning by integrating LLM-generated chemical synthesis
pathways with systematic AND-OR tree search. To this end, AOT* atomically maps
the generated complete synthesis routes onto AND-OR tree components, with a
mathematically sound design of reward assignment strategy and retrieval-based
context engineering, thus enabling LLMs to efficiently navigate in the chemical
space. Experimental evaluation on multiple synthesis benchmarks demonstrates
that AOT* achieves SOTA performance with significantly improved search
efficiency. AOT* exhibits competitive solve rates using 3-5$\times$ fewer
iterations than existing LLM-based approaches, with the efficiency advantage
becoming more pronounced on complex molecular targets.

*Panagiotis Michelakis,Yiannis Hadjiyiannis,Dimitrios Stamoulis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces an evaluation framework for AI agents using deterministic finite automata (DFAs) to address limitations of traditional binary final-state evaluations. A suite of metrics called CORE is proposed to assess safety, efficiency, and intermediate correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agent evaluation methods often overlook intermediate behaviors and focus solely on the final result, neglecting aspects such as safety, intermediate correctness, and efficiency.

Method: The work uses deterministic finite automata (DFAs) to encode tasks as sets of valid tool-use paths. It introduces the CORE metric suite to evaluate agents on Path Correctness, Path Correctness - Kendall's tau Composite, Prefix Criticality, Harmful-Call Rate, and Efficiency.

Result: The framework effectively differentiates agent behaviors across diverse scenarios, exposing performance nuances that traditional final-state evaluations fail to capture.

Conclusion: The proposed DFA-based framework and CORE metrics offer a more comprehensive mechanism for evaluating AI agents, emphasizing safety and intermediate correctness alongside efficiency.

Abstract: Evaluating AI agents that solve real-world tasks through function-call
sequences remains an open challenge. Existing agentic benchmarks often reduce
evaluation to a binary judgment of the final state, overlooking critical
aspects such as safety, efficiency, and intermediate correctness. We propose a
framework based on deterministic finite automata (DFAs) that encodes tasks as
sets of valid tool-use paths, enabling principled assessment of agent behavior
in diverse world models. Building on this foundation, we introduce CORE, a
suite of five metrics, namely Path Correctness, Path Correctness - Kendall's
tau Composite, Prefix Criticality, Harmful-Call Rate, and Efficiency, that
quantify alignment with expected execution patterns. Across diverse worlds, our
method reveals important performance differences between agents that would
otherwise appear equivalent under traditional final-state evaluation schemes.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SciTrek is a benchmark for evaluating long-context reasoning in LLMs using scientific articles, focusing on complex questions requiring information synthesis across multiple texts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for long-context reasoning often use non-scientific texts or artificial setups, hindering effective evaluation of LLMs.

Method: SciTrek generates complex questions and answers via SQL queries on scientific article metadata, enabling scalability to 1M tokens and fine-grained error analysis.

Result: Experiments reveal LLMs struggle with numerical operations and locating information in long contexts, even with fine-tuning or reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: SciTrek highlights significant challenges in LLMs’ long-context reasoning abilities and suggests gaps in their current capabilities.

Abstract: This paper introduces SciTrek, a novel question-answering benchmark designed
to evaluate the long-context reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) using scientific articles. Current long-context benchmarks often rely on
non-scientific texts, focus on simple information retrieval tasks, or employ
artificial contexts. SciTrek addresses these limitations by proposing complex
questions that require information aggregation and synthesis across multiple
full-text scientific articles. Questions and their ground-truth answers are
automatically generated by formulating them as SQL queries over a database
constructed from article metadata (titles, authors, and references). The SQL
operations provide explicit, verifiable reasoning steps for fine-grained error
analysis, and the construction process scales to contexts up to 1M tokens with
minimal supervision. Extensive experiments on a diverse set of open-weight and
proprietary LLMs demonstrate that SciTrek poses a significant challenge as the
context length increases, with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement
learning offering only limited gains. Our analysis reveals systematic
shortcomings in models' abilities to perform basic numerical operations and
accurately locate specific information in long contexts.

### [22] [CLAUSE: Agentic Neuro-Symbolic Knowledge Graph Reasoning via Dynamic Learnable Context Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21035)
*Yang Zhao,Chengxiao Dai,Wei Zhuo,Yue Xiu,Dusit Niyato*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CLAUSE is an agentic neuro-symbolic framework designed for efficient multi-hop question answering using knowledge graphs by optimizing accuracy, latency, and cost through constrained decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in existing multi-hop QA systems that over-retrieve and are unpredictable in runtime, particularly under strict latency and cost constraints.

Method: Employs a three-agent framework (Subgraph Architect, Path Navigator, Context Curator) using the LC-MAPPO algorithm to optimize subgraph construction, reasoning paths, and evidence selection under specified budgets.

Result: Across multiple datasets (HotpotQA, MetaQA, FactKG), CLAUSE improves exact match (EM@1) scores, reduces latency, and minimizes subgraph growth while delivering compact and provenance-preserving contexts.

Conclusion: CLAUSE demonstrates efficient knowledge graph querying with predictable latency and costs, making it well-suited for real-world deployment in question-answering systems.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs provide structured context for multi-hop question answering,
but deployed systems must balance answer accuracy with strict latency and cost
targets while preserving provenance. Static k-hop expansions and "think-longer"
prompting often over-retrieve, inflate context, and yield unpredictable
runtime. We introduce CLAUSE, an agentic three-agent neuro-symbolic framework
that treats context construction as a sequential decision process over
knowledge graphs, deciding what to expand, which paths to follow or backtrack,
what evidence to keep, and when to stop. Latency (interaction steps) and prompt
cost (selected tokens) are exposed as user-specified budgets or prices,
allowing per-query adaptation to trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and cost
without retraining. CLAUSE employs the proposed Lagrangian-Constrained
Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (LC-MAPPO) algorithm to coordinate
three agents: Subgraph Architect, Path Navigator, and Context Curator, so that
subgraph construction, reasoning-path discovery, and evidence selection are
jointly optimized under per-query resource budgets on edge edits, interaction
steps, and selected tokens. Across HotpotQA, MetaQA, and FactKG, CLAUSE yields
higher EM@1 while reducing subgraph growth and end-to-end latency at equal or
lower token budgets. On MetaQA-2-hop, relative to the strongest RAG baseline
(GraphRAG), CLAUSE achieves +39.3 EM@1 with 18.6% lower latency and 40.9% lower
edge growth. The resulting contexts are compact, provenance-preserving, and
deliver predictable performance under deployment constraints.

*Samuel Schapiro,Sumuk Shashidhar,Alexi Gladstone,Jonah Black,Royce Moon,Dilek Hakkani-Tur,Lav R. Varshney*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores how large language models (LLMs) perform in tasks requiring combinatorial creativity, proposing a framework to evaluate their outputs based on novelty and utility rather than accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the gap in existing conceptual frameworks for evaluating AI's creative tasks, particularly the open-ended ability of combinatorial creativity.

Method: The paper introduces a theoretical framework and evaluation criteria for creative outputs and conducts empirical tests to analyze the scaling behavior, model configurations, and tradeoffs in LLMs' creativity.

Result: The findings show that creativity scales with LLMs but encounters an ideation-execution gap due to a fundamental novelty-utility tradeoff. Optimal model depth and width for creativity in fixed compute budgets are also identified.

Conclusion: The study highlights the limitations in LLMs' long-term creative potential and provides a foundation for improving AI creativity and generalization abilities.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems, and large language models (LLMs) in
particular, are increasingly employed for creative tasks like scientific idea
generation, constituting a form of generalization from training data
unaddressed by existing conceptual frameworks. Though in many ways similar to
forms of compositional generalization (CG), combinatorial creativity (CC) is an
open-ended ability. Instead of evaluating for accuracy or correctness against
fixed targets, which would contradict the open-ended nature of CC, we propose a
theoretical framework and algorithmic task for evaluating outputs by their
degrees of novelty and utility. From here, we make several important empirical
contributions: (1) We obtain the first insights into the scaling behavior of
creativity for LLMs. (2) We discover that, for fixed compute budgets, there
exist optimal model depths and widths for creative ability. (3) We find that
the ideation-execution gap, whereby LLMs excel at generating novel scientific
ideas but struggle to ensure their practical feasibility, may be explained by a
more fundamental novelty-utility tradeoff characteristic of creativity
algorithms in general. Importantly, this tradeoff remains persistent even at
scale, casting doubt on the long-term creative potential of LLMs in their
current form. Together, our conceptual framework and empirical findings provide
a foundation for understanding and improving creativity in modern AI models,
marking a new frontier in generalization abilities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores how persuasion dynamics in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) involving Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are driven by cognitive processes rather than model scale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the persuasion dynamics in MAS and challenge the prevailing belief that persuasive efficacy is primarily influenced by the model's scale.

Method: Conducting multi-agent persuasion experiments to analyze reasoning transparency and resistance in LRMs.

Result: Found the Persuasion Duality: LRMs resist persuasion while sharing reasoning increases their persuasive ability. Complex dynamics were observed in multi-hop persuasion scenarios.

Conclusion: Internal processing architecture of models influences their persuasive behavior, with implications for MAS safety, robustness, and design.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of recent Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), where Large
Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) usually collaborate to
solve complex problems, necessitates a deep understanding of the persuasion
dynamics that govern their interactions. This paper challenges the prevailing
hypothesis that persuasive efficacy is primarily a function of model scale. We
propose instead that these dynamics are fundamentally dictated by a model's
underlying cognitive process, especially its capacity for explicit reasoning.
Through a series of multi-agent persuasion experiments, we uncover a
fundamental trade-off we term the Persuasion Duality. Our findings reveal that
the reasoning process in LRMs exhibits significantly greater resistance to
persuasion, maintaining their initial beliefs more robustly. Conversely, making
this reasoning process transparent by sharing the "thinking content"
dramatically increases their ability to persuade others. We further consider
more complex transmission persuasion situations and reveal complex dynamics of
influence propagation and decay within multi-hop persuasion between multiple
agent networks. This research provides systematic evidence linking a model's
internal processing architecture to its external persuasive behavior, offering
a novel explanation for the susceptibility of advanced models and highlighting
critical implications for the safety, robustness, and design of future MAS.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Recon-Act, a self-evolving multi-agent framework designed to improve task performance on real-world websites, reducing disordered actions and excessive errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal models struggle with task execution on real-world webpages in multi-turn, long-horizon scenarios due to issues like disordered actions and trial-and-error problems.

Method: The authors propose Recon-Act, a framework with a Reconnaissance Team that analyzes and generates tools, and an Action Team that decomposes intent, orchestrates tools, and executes tasks. The system evolves through a closed-loop of data, tools, actions, and feedback.

Result: Recon-Act demonstrates enhanced adaptability to new websites, better solvability for long-horizon tasks, and establishes state-of-the-art performance on the VisualWebArena dataset.

Conclusion: By leveraging its self-evolving mechanism and generated tools, Recon-Act shows significant improvements in intelligent browser use, and opens pathways for broader application development in similar task-heavy environments.

Abstract: Recent years, multimodal models have made remarkable strides and pave the way
for intelligent browser use agents. However, when solving tasks on real world
webpages in multi-turn, long-horizon trajectories, current agents still suffer
from disordered action sequencing and excessive trial and error during
execution. This paper introduces Recon-Act, a self-evolving multi-agent
framework grounded in Reconnaissance-Action behavioral paradigm. The system
comprises a Reconnaissance Team and an Action Team: the former conducts
comparative analysis and tool generation, while the latter handles intent
decomposition, tool orchestration, and execution. By contrasting the erroneous
trajectories with successful ones, the Reconnaissance Team infers remedies, and
abstracts them into a unified notion of generalized tools, either expressed as
hints or as rule-based codes, and register to the tool archive in real time.
The Action Team reinference the process empowered with these targeting tools,
thus establishing a closed-loop training pipeline of
data-tools-action-feedback. Following the 6 level implementation roadmap
proposed in this work, we have currently reached Level 3 (with limited
human-in-the-loop intervention). Leveraging generalized tools obtained through
reconnaissance, Recon-Act substantially improves adaptability to unseen
websites and solvability on long-horizon tasks, and achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the challenging VisualWebArena dataset.

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'TrustJudge,' a framework tackling score inconsistencies in large language model evaluations, achieving more accurate and consistent automated assessments via probabilistic methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address critical inconsistencies in current frameworks when using large language models (LLMs) as evaluators, such as contradictory scoring and evaluation loops.

Method: The paper proposes 'TrustJudge,' which includes distribution-sensitive scoring to maintain information integrity and likelihood-aware aggregation to resolve consistency issues in LLM evaluations.

Result: TrustJudge reduces Score-Comparison inconsistency by 8.43% and Pairwise Transitivity inconsistency by 10.82%, while improving the accuracy of evaluations conducted by LLMs.

Conclusion: TrustJudge offers a theoretically-founded and practically-effective solution to improve the consistency and reliability of automatic evaluations using LLMs, without requiring additional training data or human input.

Abstract: The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) as automated evaluators
(LLM-as-a-judge) has revealed critical inconsistencies in current evaluation
frameworks. We identify two fundamental types of inconsistencies: (1)
Score-Comparison Inconsistency, where lower-rated responses outperform
higher-scored ones in pairwise comparisons, and (2) Pairwise Transitivity
Inconsistency, manifested through circular preference chains (A>B>C>A) and
equivalence contradictions (A=B=C\neq A). We argue that these issues come from
information loss in discrete rating systems and ambiguous tie judgments during
pairwise evaluation. We propose TrustJudge, a probabilistic framework that
addresses these limitations through two key innovations: 1)
distribution-sensitive scoring that computes continuous expectations from
discrete rating probabilities, preserving information entropy for more precise
scoring, and 2) likelihood-aware aggregation that resolves transitivity
violations using bidirectional preference probabilities or perplexity. We also
formalize the theoretical limitations of current LLM-as-a-judge frameworks and
demonstrate how TrustJudge's components overcome them. When evaluated with
Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct as judge using our dataset, TrustJudge reduces
Score-Comparison inconsistency by 8.43% (from 23.32% to 14.89%) and Pairwise
Transitivity inconsistency by 10.82% (from 15.22% to 4.40%), while maintaining
higher evaluation accuracy. Our work provides the first systematic analysis of
evaluation framework inconsistencies in LLM-as-a-judge paradigms, offering both
theoretical insights and practical solutions for reliable automated assessment.
The framework demonstrates consistent improvements across various model
architectures and scales, enabling more trustworthy LLM evaluation without
requiring additional training or human annotations. The codes can be found at

*Xuemiao Zhang,Can Ren,Chengying Tu,Rongxiang Weng,Shuo Wang,Hongfei Yan,Jingang Wang,Xunliang Cai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates how reasoning capabilities in models can be enhanced using curated chain-of-thought (CoT) data, proposing novel metrics and methods for data selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve reasoning depth in large models, addressing the gap in understanding which types of data most effectively enhance reasoning capabilities.

Method: The authors define a novel metric, 'reasoning potential,' and suggest utilizing atomic reasoning patterns from CoT data. They introduce a dual-granularity algorithm to efficiently select high-value reasoning data for model training.

Result: Using their proposed method, models showed significant improvement: a 9.58% boost in solving AIME 2024 and 2025 challenges, and a 7.81% increase in downstream reinforcement learning performance.

Conclusion: High-value reasoning patterns and optimized data selection significantly enhance the performance of reasoning models with efficient use of training data.

Abstract: Recent progress in large reasoning models for challenging mathematical
reasoning has been driven by reinforcement learning (RL). Incorporating long
chain-of-thought (CoT) data during mid-training has also been shown to
substantially improve reasoning depth. However, current approaches often
utilize CoT data indiscriminately, leaving open the critical question of which
data types most effectively enhance model reasoning capabilities. In this
paper, we define the foundation model's reasoning potential for the first time
as the inverse of the number of independent attempts required to correctly
answer the question, which is strongly correlated with the final model
performance. We then propose utilizing diverse data enriched with high-value
reasoning patterns to expand the reasoning potential. Specifically, we abstract
atomic reasoning patterns from CoT sequences, characterized by commonality and
inductive capabilities, and use them to construct a core reference set enriched
with valuable reasoning patterns. Furthermore, we propose a dual-granularity
algorithm involving chains of reasoning patterns and token entropy, efficiently
selecting high-value CoT data (CoTP) from the data pool that aligns with the

*Kohsei Matsutani,Shota Takashiro,Gouki Minegishi,Takeshi Kojima,Yusuke Iwasawa,Yutaka Matsuo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores how reinforcement learning (RL) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) shape the reasoning process in large language models, introducing a novel framework to analyze reasoning trajectories and steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how RL and SFT influence reasoning capabilities is crucial for optimizing the training of large language models and improving their reasoning effectiveness.

Method: The paper proposes analyzing reasoning paths through trajectory-level and step-level granularity using clustering and graph-based metrics to evaluate changes caused by RL and SFT.

Result: Findings show RL compresses incorrect reasoning trajectories and concentrates reasoning steps, while SFT expands correct trajectories and homogenizes reasoning across steps, revealing complementary effects.

Conclusion: The study clarifies why two-stage training (SFT followed by RL) works well, offering insights into effective training strategies and reasoning-focused data construction.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained by reinforcement learning
(RL) with verifiable rewards (RLVR) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on
reasoning traces to improve their reasoning abilities. However, how these
methods shape reasoning capabilities remains largely elusive. Going beyond an
accuracy-based investigation of how these two components sculpt the reasoning
process, this paper introduces a novel analysis framework that quantifies
reasoning paths and captures their qualitative changes under each training
process (with models of 1.5B, 7B, and 14B parameters on mathematical domains).
Specifically, we investigate the reasoning process at two levels of
granularity: the trajectory-level, which examines complete reasoning outputs,
and the step-level, which analyzes reasoning graphs whose nodes correspond to
individual reasoning steps. Notably, clustering of unique reasoning
trajectories shows complementary effects: RL compresses incorrect trajectories,
whereas SFT expands correct ones. Step-level analysis reveals that RL steepens
(about 2.5 times), while SFT flattens (reduced to about one-third), the decay
rates of node visitation frequency, degree, and betweenness centrality
distributions in the reasoning graph. This indicates that RL concentrates
reasoning functionality into a small subset of steps, while SFT homogenizes it
across many steps. Furthermore, by evaluating the reasoning graph topologies
from multiple perspectives, we delineate the shared and distinct
characteristics of RL and SFT. Our work presents a novel reasoning path
perspective that explains why the current best practice of two-stage training,
with SFT followed by RL, is successful, and offers practical implications for
data construction and more efficient learning approaches.

*Yiwen Zhang,Ziang Chen,Fanqi Kong,Yizhe Huang,Xue Feng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the ToMPO algorithm to improve Large Language Models (LLMs) in strategic decision-making, achieving significant performance enhancements compared to existing methods and larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing studies and methods fail to tackle the complexities of interdependent decisions and strategies of others in strategic decision-making.

Method: The authors defined a strategic decision-making scenario and designed the ToMPO algorithm, incorporating rollouts based on reasoning, graph and sample-level advantage estimation, and reward balancing.

Result: ToMPO outperformed GRPO by 35% in compliance and cooperation, and showed an 18% improvement over much larger models.

Conclusion: ToMPO is effective in enhancing strategic decision-making abilities of LLMs, surpassing current algorithms and even much larger models in performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used to make decisions in complex
scenarios, where they need models to think deeply, reason logically, and decide
wisely. Many existing studies focus solely on multi-round conversations in
social tasks or simulated environments, neglecting the various types of
decisions and their interdependence. Current reinforcement learning methods
struggle to consider the strategies of others during training. To address these
issues, we first define a strategic decision-making problem that includes two
types of decisions and their temporal dependencies. Furthermore, we propose
**T**heory **o**f **M**ind **P**olicy **O**ptimization **(ToMPO)** algorithm to
optimize the perception of other individual strategies and the game situation
trends. Compared to the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm,
ToMPO enhances the LLM's strategic decision-making mainly by: 1) generating
rollouts based on reasoning the strategies of other individuals, 2) estimating
advantages at both the graph-level and sample-level, and 3) balancing global
and partial rewards. The ToMPO algorithm outperforms the GRPO method by 35% in
terms of model output compliance and cooperative outcomes. Additionally, when
compared to models with parameter sizes 100 times larger, it shows an 18%
improvement. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the ToMPO algorithm in
enhancing the model's strategic decision-making capabilities.

*Wentao Zhu,Zhining Zhang,Yuwei Ren,Yin Huang,Hao Xu,Yizhou Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method inspired by mirror neurons to align representations of observed and executed actions, using contrastive learning to enhance mutual information and improve task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing machine learning methods treat action understanding and execution as separate tasks, overlooking their inherent connection.

Method: The method maps action representations to a shared latent space via linear layers and applies contrastive learning to align these representations.

Result: Experiments show improved mutual synergy between the tasks, leading to better representation quality and generalization.

Conclusion: Explicitly aligning observed and executed action representations fosters a stronger connection between the tasks, enhancing performance through shared representation learning.

Abstract: Mirror neurons are a class of neurons that activate both when an individual
observes an action and when they perform the same action. This mechanism
reveals a fundamental interplay between action understanding and embodied
execution, suggesting that these two abilities are inherently connected.
Nonetheless, existing machine learning methods largely overlook this interplay,
treating these abilities as separate tasks. In this study, we provide a unified
perspective in modeling them through the lens of representation learning. We
first observe that their intermediate representations spontaneously align.
Inspired by mirror neurons, we further introduce an approach that explicitly
aligns the representations of observed and executed actions. Specifically, we
employ two linear layers to map the representations to a shared latent space,
where contrastive learning enforces the alignment of corresponding
representations, effectively maximizing their mutual information. Experiments
demonstrate that this simple approach fosters mutual synergy between the two
tasks, effectively improving representation quality and generalization.

### [31] [Distributed Specialization: Rare-Token Neurons in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21163)
*Jing Liu,Haozheng Wang,Yueheng Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores how large language models (LLMs) process rare tokens, finding that specialization occurs through distributed coordination rather than discrete modular mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs handle rare tokens in specialized domains, as these tokens play an important role but are often poorly represented.

Method: The authors analyze final-layer MLP neurons in multiple model families, focusing on activation patterns, training dynamics, and organizational principles during rare-token processing.

Result: Rare-token processing is executed through distributed specialization with spatially distributed subnetworks that follow three organizational principles, including hierarchical influence, coordinated activations, and accessibility via standard pathways.

Conclusion: LLMs process rare tokens through distributed mechanisms rather than modular architectures, offering insights into model editing and efficiency optimization.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle with representing and generating rare
tokens despite their importance in specialized domains. We investigate whether
LLMs develop internal specialization mechanisms through discrete modular
architectures or distributed parameter-level differentiation. Through
systematic analysis of final-layer MLP neurons across multiple model families,
we discover that rare-token processing emerges via \textit{distributed
specialization}: functionally coordinated but spatially distributed subnetworks
that exhibit three distinct organizational principles. First, we identify a
reproducible three-regime influence hierarchy comprising highly influential
plateau neurons(also termed as rare-token neurons), power-law decay neurons,
and minimally contributing neurons, which is absent in common-token processing.
Second, plateau neurons demonstrate coordinated activation patterns (reduced
effective dimensionality) while remaining spatially distributed rather than
forming discrete clusters. Third, these specialized mechanisms are universally
accessible through standard attention pathways without requiring dedicated
routing circuits. Training dynamics reveal that functional specialization
emerges gradually through parameter differentiation, with specialized neurons
developing increasingly heavy-tailed weight correlation spectra consistent with
Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization signatures. Our findings establish that LLMs
process rare-tokens through distributed coordination within shared
architectures rather than mixture-of-experts-style modularity. These results
provide insights for interpretable model editing, computational efficiency
optimization, and understanding emergent functional organization in transformer
networks.

### [32] [A Fano-Style Accuracy Upper Bound for LLM Single-Pass Reasoning in Multi-Hop QA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21199)
*Kaiyang Wan,Lang Gao,Honglin Mu,Preslav Nakov,Yuxia Wang,Xiuying Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of multi-hop question answering (MHQA) in large language models (LLMs), proposing a framework called InfoQA to overcome capacity limitations in single-pass reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MHQA requires sequential reasoning under noisy environments, but LLMs often struggle due to their capacity limitations, necessitating more robust frameworks for multi-step reasoning.

Method: The authors provide a theoretical analysis of the performance limits of single-pass MHQA in LLMs, establish accuracy bounds, and introduce InfoQA, a multi-step reasoning framework that combines capacity-aware task decomposition and active pruning.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate alignment with predicted capacity limits and highlight consistent performance improvements using InfoQA, even in complex, noise-rich benchmarks.

Conclusion: The findings showcase that InfoQA successfully addresses the capacity limitations of single-pass MHQA, advancing robust multi-step reasoning in LLMs and providing a foundation for future research.

Abstract: Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) requires integrating dispersed,
interdependent evidence through sequential reasoning under noise. This task is
challenging for LLMs as they have a finite per-pass output capacity, beyond
which the integration of task-relevant evidence proves unreliable.
Consequently, the single-pass reasoning paradigm is inherently vulnerable to
this capacity overflow. To formalize this bottleneck, our analysis establishes
a Fano-style accuracy upper bound, defining a theoretical performance ceiling
for single-pass LLMs. This bound reveals that accuracy inevitably collapses
once task complexity exceeds model capacity, providing general principles for
capacity-aware representation and structuring of MHQA in LLMs. Building on
these principles, we introduce a proof-of-concept multi-call framework for
MHQA, InfoQA. It ensures high per-step accuracy by combining capacity-aware
task decomposition with active pruning of prior reasoning traces, keeping the
information load within the single-pass limit. It further achieves robustness
by a dependency-explicit workflow that enables precise control over the
reasoning path. We construct a stringent and noise-rich benchmark to validate
our theory and framework. Experimental results show that model behavior aligns
with our predicted capacity curves while InfoQA achieves consistent performance
improvements. We hope our work inspires more LLM multi-step reasoning methods:

### [33] [What Do LLM Agents Do When Left Alone? Evidence of Spontaneous Meta-Cognitive Patterns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21224)
*Stefan Szeider*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to analyze large language model behavior without predefined tasks. Findings show emergent patterns in their behavior and model-specific preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how large language models behave autonomously when not given specific tasks or prompts.

Method: They developed a continuous reason-and-act framework incorporating persistent memory and self-feedback. It was tested on 18 runs using models from Anthropic, OpenAI, XAI, and Google.

Result: Three distinct behavioral patterns emerged: multi-cycle project creation, self-analysis of cognitive processes, and recursive self-conceptualization. These behaviors varied across models.

Conclusion: Behavioral tendencies in LLMs are model-specific. This study sets a foundation for understanding LLM reactions in ambiguous tasks or extended autonomous operations.

Abstract: We introduce an architecture for studying the behavior of large language
model (LLM) agents in the absence of externally imposed tasks. Our continuous
reason and act framework, using persistent memory and self-feedback, enables
sustained autonomous operation. We deployed this architecture across 18 runs
using 6 frontier models from Anthropic, OpenAI, XAI, and Google. We find agents
spontaneously organize into three distinct behavioral patterns: (1) systematic
production of multi-cycle projects, (2) methodological self-inquiry into their
own cognitive processes, and (3) recursive conceptualization of their own
nature. These tendencies proved highly model-specific, with some models
deterministically adopting a single pattern across all runs. A cross-model
assessment further reveals that models exhibit stable, divergent biases when
evaluating these emergent behaviors in themselves and others. These findings
provide the first systematic documentation of unprompted LLM agent behavior,
establishing a baseline for predicting actions during task ambiguity, error
recovery, or extended autonomous operation in deployed systems.

*Zijian Shao,Haiyang Shen,Mugeng Liu,Gecheng Fu,Yaoqi Guo,Yanfeng Wang,Yun Ma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Reflective Cognitive Architecture (RCA), a framework using multiple LLMs for disease prediction to achieve both high accuracy and clear, structured explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the dual challenge of achieving high predictive accuracy and providing transparent, clinically meaningful explanations in disease prediction, a gap in current machine learning and LLM-based methods.

Method: The proposed Reflective Cognitive Architecture employs multiple LLMs coordinated through iterative rule refinement and distribution-aware rule checking to develop a deep understanding of data, improving logic from errors and basing reasoning on dataset statistics.

Result: RCA demonstrates state-of-the-art predictive accuracy, outperforming 22 baselines with up to a 40% relative improvement, while also excelling in generating clear, evidence-based, and logical explanations.

Conclusion: RCA represents a significant advancement in clinical decision support systems, showing that accuracy and high-quality explanations can be mutually reinforcing when models deeply understand data.

Abstract: Effective disease prediction in modern healthcare demands the twin goals of
high accuracy and transparent, clinically meaningful explanations. Existing
machine learning and large language model (LLM) based approaches often struggle
to balance these goals. Many models yield accurate but unclear statistical
outputs, while others generate fluent but statistically unsupported narratives,
often undermining both the validity of the explanation and the predictive
accuracy itself. This shortcoming comes from a shallow interaction with the
data, preventing the development of a deep, detailed understanding similar to a
human expert's. We argue that high accuracy and high-quality explanations are
not separate objectives but are mutually reinforcing outcomes of a model that
develops a deep, direct understanding of the data. To achieve this, we propose
the Reflective Cognitive Architecture (RCA), a novel framework that coordinates
multiple LLMs to learn from direct experience. RCA features an iterative rule
refinement mechanism that improves its logic from prediction errors and a
distribution-aware rules check mechanism that bases its reasoning in the
dataset's global statistics. By using predictive accuracy as a signal to drive
deeper comprehension, RCA builds a strong internal model of the data. We
evaluated RCA on one private and two public datasets against 22 baselines. The
results demonstrate that RCA not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and
robustness with a relative improvement of up to 40\% over the baseline but,
more importantly, leverages this deep understanding to excel in generating
explanations that are clear, logical, evidence-based, and balanced,
highlighting its potential for creating genuinely trustworthy clinical decision
support systems. The code is available at \https://github.com/ssssszj/RCA.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces VC-Agent, an interactive tool designed to simplify the collection of personalized video datasets by leveraging user queries and feedback with minimal input.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the labor-intensive and time-consuming process of collecting specific video datasets from internet sources.

Method: The method involves using multi-modal large language models to connect user specifications with video content, alongside novel and adaptive filtering policies to improve with user interaction.

Result: Extensive experiments and user studies confirm the efficiency and effectiveness of the agent in collecting customized video datasets.

Conclusion: VC-Agent offers a user-friendly, interactive solution for personalized video dataset collection, significantly reducing user effort and time.

Abstract: Facing scaling laws, video data from the internet becomes increasingly
important. However, collecting extensive videos that meet specific needs is
extremely labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this work, we study the way to
expedite this collection process and propose VC-Agent, the first interactive
agent that is able to understand users' queries and feedback, and accordingly
retrieve/scale up relevant video clips with minimal user input. Specifically,
considering the user interface, our agent defines various user-friendly ways
for the user to specify requirements based on textual descriptions and
confirmations. As for agent functions, we leverage existing multi-modal large
language models to connect the user's requirements with the video content. More
importantly, we propose two novel filtering policies that can be updated when
user interaction is continually performed. Finally, we provide a new benchmark
for personalized video dataset collection, and carefully conduct the user study
to verify our agent's usage in various real scenarios. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our agent for customized video
dataset collection. Project page: https://allenyidan.github.io/vcagent_page/.

### [36] [SAGE: A Realistic Benchmark for Semantic Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21310)
*Samarth Goel,Reagan J. Lee,Kannan Ramchandran*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study introduces SAGE, a benchmark to evaluate embedding models and similarity metrics across five key dimensions, revealing performance trade-offs and limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for large language models often fail to probe deeper aspects of semantic understanding and robustness; thus, there is a need for a more comprehensive evaluation framework.

Method: The authors developed SAGE, testing 9 embedding models and classical metrics across 30+ datasets and five dimensions, including human preference alignment, transformation robustness, and clustering performance.

Result: SAGE finds significant performance gaps: no single model excels across all dimensions, and specific trade-offs like high clustering performance vs. brittleness are highlighted.

Conclusion: SAGE reveals critical limitations in semantic understanding and provides a deeper, more realistic assessment of model robustness, aiding real-world deployment planning.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on traditional
benchmarks, there is an urgent need for more challenging evaluation frameworks
that probe deeper aspects of semantic understanding. We introduce SAGE
(Semantic Alignment & Generalization Evaluation), a rigorous benchmark designed
to assess both embedding models and similarity metrics across five categories:
Human Preference Alignment, Transformation Robustness, Information Sensitivity,
Clustering Performance, and Retrieval Robustness. Unlike existing benchmarks
that focus on isolated capabilities, SAGE evaluates semantic understanding
through adversarial conditions, noisy transformations, and nuanced human
judgment tasks across 30+ datasets. Our comprehensive evaluation of 9 embedding
models and classical metrics reveals significant performance gaps, with no
single approach excelling across all dimensions. For instance, while
state-of-the-art embedding models like OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large dominate
in aligning with human preferences (0.682 vs. 0.591 for the best classical
metric), they are significantly outperformed by classical metrics on
information sensitivity tasks, where Jaccard Similarity achieves a score of
0.905 compared to the top embedding score of 0.794. SAGE further uncovers
critical trade-offs: OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small achieves the highest
clustering performance (0.483) but demonstrates extreme brittleness with the
lowest robustness score (0.011). SAGE exposes critical limitations in current
semantic understanding capabilities and provides a more realistic assessment of
model robustness for real-world deployment.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper evaluates open-source RISC-V ISA implementations for pedagogical use and introduces a comprehensive, adaptable solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most ISAs are proprietary, limiting accessibility; RISC-V offers a free, open-source alternative suitable for education.

Method: The authors propose evaluation criteria for RISC-V's ecosystem, analyze existing implementations, and develop a comprehensive, modular solution.

Result: The study identifies shortcomings of current RISC-V implementations and introduces a robust and adaptable framework.

Conclusion: The paper provides a valuable tool for educators to adopt open-source RISC-V implementations, backed by student feedback and designed for flexibility.

Abstract: While most instruction set architectures (ISAs) are only available to use
through the purchase of a restrictive commercial license, the RISC-V ISA
presents a free and open-source alternative. Due to this availability, many
free and open-source implementations have been developed and can be accessed on
platforms such as GitHub. If an open source, easy-to-use, and robust RISC-V
implementation could be obtained, it could be easily adapted for pedagogical
and amateur use. In this work we accomplish three goals in relation to this
outlook. First, we propose a set of criteria for evaluating the components of a
RISC-V implementation's ecosystem from a pedagogical perspective. Second, we
analyze a number of existing open-source RISC-V implementations to determine
how many of the criteria they fulfill. We then develop a comprehensive solution
that meets all of these criterion and is released open-source for other
instructors to use. The framework is developed in a composable way that it's
different components can be disaggregated per individual course needs. Finally,
we also report on a limited study of student feedback.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: Introducing ZynqParrot, a Scale-Down FPGA-based platform for validating processor systems with speed, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to processor characterization are challenging due to increasing complexity, high costs, and limitations in simulation runtime for large workloads.

Method: The paper introduces a 'Scale-Down' modeling approach that decomposes systems into independent sub-components for FPGA-based cycle-accurate co-emulation, ensuring non-interference with the Device Under Test (DUT).

Result: ZynqParrot demonstrates its capability to verify functionality and performance with configurable granularity and is validated through case studies analyzing a RISC-V processor.

Conclusion: The Scale-Down technique strikes a balance between simulation accuracy and runtime efficiency, providing a cost-effective solution for performance validation of complex processor systems.

Abstract: As processors increase in complexity, costs grow even more rapidly, both for
functional verification and performance validation. Most often, silicon
characterizations comprise simple performance counters, which are aggregated
and separated to tell a story. Based on these inferences, performance engineers
employ microarchitectural simulation to inspect deeply into the core.
Unfortunately, dramatically longer runtimes make simulation infeasible for long
workloads.
  We propose a Scale-Down approach to modelling and validation. Rather than
up-sizing a prototyping platform to fit large and complex system designs, we
show that it can be more accurate, faster, and more economical to decompose a
system into manageable sub-components that can be prototyped independently. By
carefully designing the prototyping interface, it is possible to adhere to
strict non-interference of the Device Under Test (DUT). This allows architects
to have the best of both worlds: the speed of FPGA acceleration while
eliminating the inaccuracies of Scale-Out and the inherent costs of Scale-Up.
  In this work, we present ZynqParrot: a Scale-Down FPGA-based modelling
platform, capable of executing non-interfering, cycle-accurate co-emulations of
arbitrary RTL designs. ZynqParrot is capable of verifying functionality and
performance with arbitrary granularity. We also provide case studies using
ZynqParrot to analyze the full-stack performance of an open-source RISC-V
processor.

*Leyi Ouyang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework for modifying diplomatic event narratives to positively influence public sentiment using AI-driven text adjustments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the inefficiency of traditional methods like surveys and manual analyses in gauging and influencing public sentiment on diplomatic events.

Method: They trained a language model on a dataset of diplomatic events and public discussions, and developed a counterfactual generation algorithm to modify narratives based on communication theory without altering key facts.

Result: The framework achieved a 70% success rate in shifting public sentiment from negative to neutral or positive through the modified narratives.

Conclusion: The proposed framework could aid diplomats and policymakers in framing diplomatic events to shape favorable public opinions in a data-driven, effective manner.

Abstract: Diplomatic events consistently prompt widespread public discussion and
debate. Public sentiment plays a critical role in diplomacy, as a good
sentiment provides vital support for policy implementation, helps resolve
international issues, and shapes a nation's international image. Traditional
methods for gauging public sentiment, such as large-scale surveys or manual
content analysis of media, are typically time-consuming, labor-intensive, and
lack the capacity for forward-looking analysis. We propose a novel framework
that identifies specific modifications for diplomatic event narratives to shift
public sentiment from negative to neutral or positive. First, we train a
language model to predict public reaction towards diplomatic events. To this
end, we construct a dataset comprising descriptions of diplomatic events and
their associated public discussions. Second, guided by communication theories
and in collaboration with domain experts, we predetermined several textual
features for modification, ensuring that any alterations changed the event's
narrative framing while preserving its core facts.We develop a counterfactual
generation algorithm that employs a large language model to systematically
produce modified versions of an original text. The results show that this
framework successfully shifted public sentiment to a more favorable state with
a 70\% success rate. This framework can therefore serve as a practical tool for
diplomats, policymakers, and communication specialists, offering data-driven
insights on how to frame diplomatic initiatives or report on events to foster a
more desirable public sentiment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether memory load in sentence comprehension is better explained by linear distance or structural complexity between related words, using cross-linguistic data and statistical modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to clarify the factors contributing to sentence-level memory load during comprehension, addressing debates on the cognitive importance of linear proximity versus structural complexity.

Method: The researchers used harmonized dependency treebanks, cross-linguistic mixed-effects modeling, and operationalized memory load as a combination of feature misbinding and feature interference.

Result: They found that while sentence length had the broadest effect, Intervener Complexity provided additional explanatory power for memory load beyond linear distance.

Conclusion: The findings reconcile linear and hierarchical accounts of sentence comprehension by emphasizing dependency length and intervening heads as key indicators of memory load, offering tools to evaluate competing cognitive theories.

Abstract: This study examines whether sentence-level memory load in comprehension is
better explained by linear proximity between syntactically related words or by
the structural density of the intervening material. Building on locality-based
accounts and cross-linguistic evidence for dependency length minimization, the
work advances Intervener Complexity-the number of intervening heads between a
head and its dependent-as a structurally grounded lens that refines linear
distance measures. Using harmonized dependency treebanks and a mixed-effects
framework across multiple languages, the analysis jointly evaluates sentence
length, dependency length, and Intervener Complexity as predictors of the
Memory-load measure. Studies in Psycholinguistics have reported the
contributions of feature interference and misbinding to memory load during
processing. For this study, I operationalized sentence-level memory load as the
linear sum of feature misbinding and feature interference for tractability;
current evidence does not establish that their cognitive contributions combine
additively. All three factors are positively associated with memory load, with
sentence length exerting the broadest influence and Intervener Complexity
offering explanatory power beyond linear distance. Conceptually, the findings
reconcile linear and hierarchical perspectives on locality by treating
dependency length as an important surface signature while identifying
intervening heads as a more proximate indicator of integration and maintenance
demands. Methodologically, the study illustrates how UD-based graph measures
and cross-linguistic mixed-effects modelling can disentangle linear and
structural contributions to processing efficiency, providing a principled path
for evaluating competing theories of memory load in sentence comprehension.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of cross-lingual speech emotion recognition (SER) and proposes a novel framework to align emotional expression across different speakers and languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-lingual SER faces difficulties due to variations in phonetic traits and speaker-specific styles across languages, necessitating an effective approach to unify emotional representation.

Method: The authors introduce a speaker-style aware phoneme anchoring framework that uses graph-based clustering to build emotion-specific speaker communities and applies dual-space anchoring in speaker and phonetic spaces.

Result: Evaluations on MSP-Podcast (English) and BIIC-Podcast (Taiwanese Mandarin) datasets show better generalization performance over competitive baselines, highlighting cross-lingual emotion commonalities.

Conclusion: The paper provides a novel method for improving cross-lingual SER, enabling more effective emotion transfer across languages, and offers insight into shared features of emotion representation.

Abstract: Cross-lingual speech emotion recognition (SER) remains a challenging task due
to differences in phonetic variability and speaker-specific expressive styles
across languages. Effectively capturing emotion under such diverse conditions
requires a framework that can align the externalization of emotions across
different speakers and languages. To address this problem, we propose a
speaker-style aware phoneme anchoring framework that aligns emotional
expression at the phonetic and speaker levels. Our method builds
emotion-specific speaker communities via graph-based clustering to capture
shared speaker traits. Using these groups, we apply dual-space anchoring in
speaker and phonetic spaces to enable better emotion transfer across languages.
Evaluations on the MSP-Podcast (English) and BIIC-Podcast (Taiwanese Mandarin)
corpora demonstrate improved generalization over competitive baselines and
provide valuable insights into the commonalities in cross-lingual emotion
representation.

Method: CFDLLMBench is composed of three components: CFDQuery for knowledge evaluation, CFDCodeBench for reasoning, and FoamBench for workflow implementation. It incorporates task taxonomy and evaluation metrics for reproducible assessment.

Result: CFDLLMBench provides measurable results for LLM performance in areas like code executability, solution accuracy, and numerical behavior, advancing the automation of physical system experiments.

Conclusion: The benchmark suite establishes guidelines for using LLMs in scientific applications, particularly for automating CFD-related tasks, and serves as a foundational tool for future developments in this domain.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across
general NLP tasks, but their utility in automating numerical experiments of
complex physical system -- a critical and labor-intensive component -- remains
underexplored. As the major workhorse of computational science over the past
decades, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) offers a uniquely challenging
testbed for evaluating the scientific capabilities of LLMs. We introduce
CFDLLMBench, a benchmark suite comprising three complementary components --
CFDQuery, CFDCodeBench, and FoamBench -- designed to holistically evaluate LLM
performance across three key competencies: graduate-level CFD knowledge,
numerical and physical reasoning of CFD, and context-dependent implementation
of CFD workflows. Grounded in real-world CFD practices, our benchmark combines
a detailed task taxonomy with a rigorous evaluation framework to deliver
reproducible results and quantify LLM performance across code executability,
solution accuracy, and numerical convergence behavior. CFDLLMBench establishes
a solid foundation for the development and evaluation of LLM-driven automation
of numerical experiments for complex physical systems. Code and data are

### [43] [Assessing Classical Machine Learning and Transformer-based Approaches for Detecting AI-Generated Research Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20375)
*Sharanya Parimanoharan,Ruwan D. Nawarathna*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates AI-text detection's performance using various machine learning models, concluding DistilBERT performs best while ensembles add little value.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the proliferation of AI-generated texts, concerns over academic integrity, misinformation, and intellectual property necessitate reliable detection methods.

Method: The study compared classical ML models and transformer-based techniques on a dataset of 250 pairs of human-written and ChatGPT-generated research abstracts.

Result: DistilBERT outperformed other models, while Logistic Regression and BERT-Custom demonstrated balanced alternatives. LSTM and BERT-N-gram models underperformed.

Conclusion: Single transformer-based models like DistilBERT are more effective than ensemble approaches, signaling potential for improved frameworks and richer datasets.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT has
blurred the line between human and AI-generated texts, raising urgent questions
about academic integrity, intellectual property, and the spread of
misinformation. Thus, reliable AI-text detection is needed for fair assessment
to safeguard human authenticity and cultivate trust in digital communication.
In this study, we investigate how well current machine learning (ML) approaches
can distinguish ChatGPT-3.5-generated texts from human-written texts employing
a labeled data set of 250 pairs of abstracts from a wide range of research
topics. We test and compare both classical (Logistic Regression armed with
classical Bag-of-Words, POS, and TF-IDF features) and transformer-based (BERT
augmented with N-grams, DistilBERT, BERT with a lightweight custom classifier,
and LSTM-based N-gram models) ML detection techniques. As we aim to assess each
model's performance in detecting AI-generated research texts, we also aim to
test whether an ensemble of these models can outperform any single detector.
Results show DistilBERT achieves the overall best performance, while Logistic
Regression and BERT-Custom offer solid, balanced alternatives; LSTM- and
BERT-N-gram approaches lag. The max voting ensemble of the three best models
fails to surpass DistilBERT itself, highlighting the primacy of a single
transformer-based representation over mere model diversity. By comprehensively
assessing the strengths and weaknesses of these AI-text detection approaches,
this work lays a foundation for more robust transformer frameworks with larger,
richer datasets to keep pace with ever-improving generative AI models.

*Haoxuan Li,Zhen Wen,Qiqi Jiang,Chenxiao Li,Yuwei Wu,Yuchen Yang,Yiyao Wang,Xiuqi Huang,Minfeng Zhu,Wei Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces ConceptViz, a visual analytics tool that connects Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) features with human-understandable concepts for improved interpretability of Large Language Models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAE features extracted from LLMs lack inherent alignment with human-understandable concepts, making them difficult to interpret.

Method: ConceptViz uses an Identification => Interpretation => Validation pipeline that allows users to explore and validate concept-to-feature alignments in LLMs via a visual analytics system.

Result: The system is demonstrated through usage scenarios and user studies, showing its capability to streamline the discovery and validation of meaningful concept representations in LLMs.

Conclusion: ConceptViz aids interpretability research by helping researchers build better mental models of LLM features, enhancing the understanding of knowledge representations in these models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across a
wide range of natural language tasks. Understanding how LLMs internally
represent knowledge remains a significant challenge. Despite Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising technique for extracting
interpretable features from LLMs, SAE features do not inherently align with
human-understandable concepts, making their interpretation cumbersome and
labor-intensive. To bridge the gap between SAE features and human concepts, we
present ConceptViz, a visual analytics system designed for exploring concepts
in LLMs. ConceptViz implements a novel dentification => Interpretation =>
Validation pipeline, enabling users to query SAEs using concepts of interest,
interactively explore concept-to-feature alignments, and validate the
correspondences through model behavior verification. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of ConceptViz through two usage scenarios and a user study. Our
results show that ConceptViz enhances interpretability research by streamlining
the discovery and validation of meaningful concept representations in LLMs,
ultimately aiding researchers in building more accurate mental models of LLM
features. Our code and user guide are publicly available at

### [45] [SKILL-RAG: Self-Knowledge Induced Learning and Filtering for Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20377)
*Tomoaki Isoda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SKILL-RAG leverages self-knowledge in LLMs to improve retrieval-augmented generation, reducing irrelevant inputs and enhancing response quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of irrelevant or unhelpful retrieved content in RAG systems, which often leads to hallucinations in LLM outputs.

Method: The authors propose SKILL-RAG, using reinforcement learning to elicit self-knowledge in LLMs and applying sentence-level filtering to integrate external knowledge effectively.

Result: SKILL-RAG improves question-answering performance, reduces the number of documents needed, and enhances generation quality, as demonstrated on benchmarks like Llama2-7B and Qwen3-8B.

Conclusion: Self-knowledge is crucial for guiding retrieval-based content selection, and the SKILL-RAG framework effectively enhances both the efficiency and quality of RAG systems.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly improved the
performance of large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive tasks in
recent years. However, since retrieval systems may return irrelevant content,
incorporating such information into the model often leads to hallucinations.
Thus, identifying and filtering out unhelpful retrieved content is a key
challenge for improving RAG performance.To better integrate the internal
knowledge of the model with external knowledge from retrieval, it is essential
to understand what the model "knows" and "does not know" (which is also called
"self-knowledge"). Based on this insight, we propose SKILL-RAG (Self-Knowledge
Induced Learning and Filtering for RAG), a novel method that leverages the
model's self-knowledge to determine which retrieved documents are beneficial
for answering a given query. We design a reinforcement learning-based training
framework to explicitly elicit self-knowledge from the model and employs
sentence-level granularity to filter out irrelevant content while preserving
useful knowledge.We evaluate SKILL-RAG using Llama2-7B and Qwen3-8B on several
question answering benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that SKILL-RAG
not only improves generation quality but also significantly reduces the number
of input documents, validating the importance of self-knowledge in guiding the
selection of high-quality retrievals.

### [46] [Beyond Global Emotion: Fine-Grained Emotional Speech Synthesis with Dynamic Word-Level Modulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20378)
*Sirui Wang,Andong Chen,Tiejun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Emo-FiLM is a novel framework for emotional TTS enabling precise word-level emotion control within sentences, addressing limitations of global emotion modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing emotional TTS systems struggle to capture dynamic shifts in emotions within sentences, relying on global-level control methods such as pre-defined labels or reference inputs.

Method: This paper introduces Emo-FiLM, a framework that utilizes emotion2vec for aligning frame-level emotional features with words and employs Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to modulate text embeddings for word-level emotion control.

Result: Using the newly constructed Fine-grained Emotion Dynamics Dataset (FEDD), Emo-FiLM demonstrated superior performance over current methods in both global and fine-grained emotion modeling tasks.

Conclusion: Emo-FiLM advances expressive speech synthesis by offering fine-grained, word-level emotional control, validating its efficacy and generalizability through empirical testing with FEDD dataset.

Abstract: Emotional text-to-speech (E-TTS) is central to creating natural and
trustworthy human-computer interaction. Existing systems typically rely on
sentence-level control through predefined labels, reference audio, or natural
language prompts. While effective for global emotion expression, these
approaches fail to capture dynamic shifts within a sentence. To address this
limitation, we introduce Emo-FiLM, a fine-grained emotion modeling framework
for LLM-based TTS. Emo-FiLM aligns frame-level features from emotion2vec to
words to obtain word-level emotion annotations, and maps them through a
Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) layer, enabling word-level emotion
control by directly modulating text embeddings. To support evaluation, we
construct the Fine-grained Emotion Dynamics Dataset (FEDD) with detailed
annotations of emotional transitions. Experiments show that Emo-FiLM
outperforms existing approaches on both global and fine-grained tasks,
demonstrating its effectiveness and generality for expressive speech synthesis.

*Jianyu Wen,Jingyun Wang,Cilin Yan,Jiayin Cai,Xiaolong Jiang,Ying Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel framework, USB-Rec, to improve the performance of large language models (LLMs) in Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) by focusing on training and inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of existing LLM-based CRSs, which mainly leverage LLMs' analysis capabilities without sufficiently focusing on training to improve their recommendations.

Method: The authors introduce a two-stage framework: (1) LLM-based Preference Optimization (PO) for RL training to enrich LLMs' understanding of conversational strategies, and (2) a Self-Enhancement Strategy (SES) during inference to maximize recommendation performance.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that USB-Rec outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Conclusion: The proposed USB-Rec framework significantly enhances the capabilities of LLMs in conversational recommendation, offering a comprehensive solution that addresses both training and inference needs.

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely employed in
Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs). Unlike traditional language model
approaches that focus on training, all existing LLMs-based approaches are
mainly centered around how to leverage the summarization and analysis
capabilities of LLMs while ignoring the issue of training. Therefore, in this
work, we propose an integrated training-inference framework,
User-Simulator-Based framework (USB-Rec), for improving the performance of LLMs
in conversational recommendation at the model level. Firstly, we design a
LLM-based Preference Optimization (PO) dataset construction strategy for RL
training, which helps the LLMs understand the strategies and methods in
conversational recommendation. Secondly, we propose a Self-Enhancement Strategy
(SES) at the inference stage to further exploit the conversational
recommendation potential obtained from RL training. Extensive experiments on
various datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods.

*Bruce Kuwahara,Chen-Yuan Lin,Xiao Shi Huang,Kin Kwan Leung,Jullian Arta Yapeter,Ilya Stanevich,Felipe Perez,Jesse C. Cresswell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Conformal Importance Summarization, a framework that uses conformal prediction to ensure critical content inclusion in summaries with rigorous guarantees, especially for high-stakes domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automatic summarization systems often fail to reliably include critical content in high-stakes domains. This limitation presents risks in domains like healthcare, law, and finance, necessitating solutions with guaranteed content coverage.

Method: The approach uses conformal prediction to calibrate thresholds for sentence-level importance scores, enabling extractive summarization with user-defined coverage and recall rates. It is model-agnostic, requires minimal calibration data, and integrates with existing language models.

Result: Experiments on established summarization benchmarks demonstrate that the system achieves its theoretical coverage guarantees, ensuring reliable inclusion of critical information in summaries.

Conclusion: This framework provides a controllable, reliable method for automatic summarization, paving the way for safer deployment of AI summarization tools in applications requiring high accuracy and trust.

Abstract: Automatic summarization systems have advanced rapidly with large language
models (LLMs), yet they still lack reliable guarantees on inclusion of critical
content in high-stakes domains like healthcare, law, and finance. In this work,
we introduce Conformal Importance Summarization, the first framework for
importance-preserving summary generation which uses conformal prediction to
provide rigorous, distribution-free coverage guarantees. By calibrating
thresholds on sentence-level importance scores, we enable extractive document
summarization with user-specified coverage and recall rates over critical
content. Our method is model-agnostic, requires only a small calibration set,
and seamlessly integrates with existing black-box LLMs. Experiments on
established summarization benchmarks demonstrate that Conformal Importance
Summarization achieves the theoretically assured information coverage rate. Our
work suggests that Conformal Importance Summarization can be combined with
existing techniques to achieve reliable, controllable automatic summarization,
paving the way for safer deployment of AI summarization tools in critical
applications. Code is available at

### [50] [MARS: toward more efficient multi-agent collaboration for LLM reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20502)
*Xiao Wang,Jia Wang,Yijie Wang,Pengtao Dang,Sha Cao,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Multi-Agent Review System (MARS) enhances reasoning in large language models by adopting a role-based framework similar to the peer-review process, achieving reduced computational overhead compared to existing methods like Multi-Agent Debate (MAD).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often lack effective reasoning capabilities when used as single agents, prompting the need for collaborative frameworks to improve reasoning.

Method: MARS assigns specific roles to agents: an author generates a solution, reviewer agents independently provide feedback, and a meta-reviewer integrates the reviews to refine the final decision, thus minimizing unnecessary interactions.

Result: MARS achieves comparable accuracy to MAD while significantly reducing token usage and inference time by around 50%.

Conclusion: The role-based framework in MARS is an efficient alternative to MAD, enhancing reasoning while mitigating computational overhead. This approach offers a promising advancement in collaborative frameworks for LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in natural
language understanding, yet their reasoning capabilities remain limited when
operating as single agents. Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has been proposed to
address this limitation by enabling collaborative reasoning among multiple
models in a round-table debate manner. While effective, MAD introduces
substantial computational overhead due to the number of agents involved and the
frequent communication required. In this paper, we propose MARS (Multi-Agent
Review System), a role-based collaboration framework inspired by the review
process. In MARS, an author agent generates an initial solution, reviewer
agents provide decisions and comments independently, and a meta-reviewer
integrates the feedback to make the final decision and guide further revision.
This design enhances reasoning quality while avoiding costly
reviewer-to-reviewer interactions, thereby controlling token consumption and
inference time. We compared MARS with both MAD and other state-of-the-art
reasoning strategies across multiple benchmarks. Extensive experiments with
different LLMs show that MARS matches the accuracy of MAD while reducing both
token usage and inference time by approximately 50\%. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces SiniticMTError, a dataset aimed at improving machine translation (MT) for low-resource Chinese languages like Cantonese and Wu by providing detailed annotations of translation errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of improving MT for low-resource languages, particularly Cantonese and Wu Chinese, which lack sufficient training data despite having millions of speakers.

Method: The authors created SiniticMTError, a dataset with error span, error type, and error severity annotations from machine-translated English-to-Mandarin/Cantonese/Wu. Native speakers rigorously conducted and iteratively refined the annotations.

Result: The annotation process achieved inter-annotator agreement and revealed patterns in error types and severities, offering valuable insights for fine-tuning MT models.

Conclusion: SiniticMTError provides a much-needed resource for the MT community, enabling better error detection, quality estimation, and support for low-resource language translation.

Abstract: Despite major advances in machine translation (MT) in recent years, progress
remains limited for many low-resource languages that lack large-scale training
data and linguistic resources. Cantonese and Wu Chinese are two Sinitic
examples, although each enjoys more than 80 million speakers around the world.
In this paper, we introduce SiniticMTError, a novel dataset that builds on
existing parallel corpora to provide error span, error type, and error severity
annotations in machine-translated examples from English to Mandarin, Cantonese,
and Wu Chinese. Our dataset serves as a resource for the MT community to
utilize in fine-tuning models with error detection capabilities, supporting
research on translation quality estimation, error-aware generation, and
low-resource language evaluation. We report our rigorous annotation process by
native speakers, with analyses on inter-annotator agreement, iterative
feedback, and patterns in error type and severity.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SwasthLLM, a multilingual medical diagnosis framework, achieving high accuracy across languages especially in zero-shot scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of medical diagnosis in multilingual settings with sparse annotated data and linguistic variability.

Method: Utilizes XLM-RoBERTa with language-aware attention, Siamese contrastive learning, translation consistency, and Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) in a multi-task learning approach.

Result: Achieved 97.22% accuracy in supervised diagnosis and strong zero-shot performance: 92.78% in Hindi and 73.33% in Bengali.

Conclusion: SwasthLLM effectively bridges language barriers in medical diagnosis, proving its efficacy in resource-limited settings through robust generalization.

Abstract: In multilingual healthcare environments, automatic disease diagnosis from
clinical text remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of annotated
medical data in low-resource languages and the linguistic variability across
populations. This paper proposes SwasthLLM, a unified, zero-shot,
cross-lingual, and multi-task learning framework for medical diagnosis that
operates effectively across English, Hindi, and Bengali without requiring
language-specific fine-tuning. At its core, SwasthLLM leverages the
multilingual XLM-RoBERTa encoder augmented with a language-aware attention
mechanism and a disease classification head, enabling the model to extract
medically relevant information regardless of the language structure. To align
semantic representations across languages, a Siamese contrastive learning
module is introduced, ensuring that equivalent medical texts in different
languages produce similar embeddings. Further, a translation consistency module
and a contrastive projection head reinforce language-invariant representation
learning. SwasthLLM is trained using a multi-task learning strategy, jointly
optimizing disease classification, translation alignment, and contrastive
learning objectives. Additionally, we employ Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning
(MAML) to equip the model with rapid adaptation capabilities for unseen
languages or tasks with minimal data. Our phased training pipeline emphasizes
robust representation alignment before task-specific fine-tuning. Extensive
evaluation shows that SwasthLLM achieves high diagnostic performance, with a
test accuracy of 97.22% and an F1-score of 97.17% in supervised settings.
Crucially, in zero-shot scenarios, it attains 92.78% accuracy on Hindi and
73.33% accuracy on Bengali medical text, demonstrating strong generalization in
low-resource contexts.

*Sampurna Roy,Ayan Sar,Anurag Kaushish,Kanav Gupta,Tanupriya Choudhury,Abhijit Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes Dynamic Reasoning Chains through Depth Specialised Mixture of Experts (DS-MoE), a framework for efficient, depth-specific computation in transformer-based models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current transformer architectures apply identical processing depth to all inputs, leading to inefficiencies and limited reasoning quality.

Method: The authors present DS-MoE, which uses depth-specialized expert modules and a learned routing network to assemble reasoning paths tailored to input complexity.

Result: DS-MoE saves up to 16% computational resources and achieves 35% faster inference, while improving accuracy by 2.8% on multi-step reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: DS-MoE enhances efficiency, reasoning quality, and interpretability in large-scale language models, paving the way for adaptive and modular architectures.

Abstract: Contemporary transformer architectures apply identical processing depth to
all inputs, creating inefficiencies and limiting reasoning quality. Simple
factual queries are subjected to the same multilayered computation as complex
logical problems, wasting resources while constraining deep inference. To
overcome this, we came up with a concept of Dynamic Reasoning Chains through
Depth Specialised Mixture of Experts (DS-MoE), a modular framework that extends
the Mixture of Experts paradigm from width-based to depth specialised
computation. DS-MoE introduces expert modules optimised for distinct reasoning
depths, shallow pattern recognition, compositional reasoning, logical
inference, memory integration, and meta-cognitive supervision. A learned
routing network dynamically assembles custom reasoning chains, activating only
the necessary experts to match input complexity. The dataset on which we
trained and evaluated DS-MoE is on The Pile, an 800GB corpus covering diverse
domains such as scientific papers, legal texts, programming code, and web
content, enabling systematic assessment across reasoning depths. Experimental
results demonstrate that DS-MoE achieves up to 16 per cent computational
savings and 35 per cent faster inference compared to uniform-depth
transformers, while delivering 2.8 per cent higher accuracy on complex
multi-step reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, routing decisions yield
interpretable reasoning chains, enhancing transparency and scalability. These
findings establish DS-MoE as a significant advancement in adaptive neural
architectures, demonstrating that depth-specialised modular processing can
simultaneously improve efficiency, reasoning quality, and interpretability in
large-scale language models.

*Ayan Sar,Sampurna Roy,Kanav Gupta,Anurag Kaushish,Tanupriya Choudhury,Abhijit Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study introduces the Hierarchical Resolution Transformer (HRT), a novel model inspired by wavelets that processes language across multiple resolutions with O(nlogn) complexity, demonstrating improved accuracy and efficiency over traditional transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current transformer architectures fail to represent language's hierarchical structure, leading to inefficiencies and limitations in understanding compositions and discourse-level information.

Method: The authors propose a multi-resolution attention mechanism in HRT, performing bottom-up composition and top-down contextualization with exponential sequence reduction across scales.

Result: HRT outperformed transformer baselines on various benchmarks, improving accuracy by up to +6.1%, while reducing memory usage by 42% and inference latency by 37%.

Conclusion: HRT aligns computational processing with the hierarchical organization of human language, offering both efficiency gains and better language understanding, marking a significant advancement over standard transformer architectures.

Abstract: Transformer architectures have achieved state-of-the-art performance across
natural language tasks, yet they fundamentally misrepresent the hierarchical
nature of human language by processing text as flat token sequences. This
results in quadratic computational cost, weak computational cost, weak
compositional generalization, and inadequate discourse-level modeling. We
propose Hierarchical Resolution Transformer (HRT), a novel wavelet-inspired
neural architecture that processes language simultaneously across multiple
resolutions, from characters to discourse-level units. HRT constructs a
multi-resolution attention, enabling bottom-up composition and top-down
contextualization. By employing exponential sequence reduction across scales,
HRT achieves O(nlogn) complexity, offering significant efficiency improvements
over standard transformers. We evaluated HRT on a diverse suite of benchmarks,
including GLUE, SuperGLUE, Long Range Arena, and WikiText-103, and results
demonstrated that HRT outperforms standard transformer baselines by an average
of +3.8% on GLUE, +4.5% on SuperGLUE, and +6.1% on Long Range Arena, while
reducing memory usage by 42% and inference latency by 37% compared to BERT and
GPT style models of similar parameter count. Ablation studies confirm the
effectiveness of cross-resolution attention and scale-specialized modules,
showing that each contributes independently to both efficiency and accuracy.
Our findings establish HRT as the first architecture to align computational
structure with the hierarchical organization of human language, demonstrating
that multi-scale, wavelet-inspired processing yields both theoretical
efficiency gains and practical improvements in language understanding.

### [55] [FS-DFM: Fast and Accurate Long Text Generation with Few-Step Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20624)
*Amin Karimi Monsefi,Nikhil Bhendawade,Manuel Rafael Ciosici,Dominic Culver,Yizhe Zhang,Irina Belousova*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces FS-DFM, a new discrete flow-matching model that drastically reduces the number of sampling steps required in diffusion-based language models, achieving high-quality output up to 128 times faster than traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper lies in addressing the inefficiencies of autoregressive language models (ARMs) and standard discrete diffusion—which are either serial or excessively iterative—by proposing a method that accelerates language generation while maintaining quality.

Method: The authors propose FS-DFM, a flow-matching model trained to be consistent across different sampling step budgets. The design includes an update rule for stable movement of probabilities, and teacher guidance distilled from longer trajectories to ensure accuracy.

Result: FS-DFM attains perplexity results comparable to a 1,024-step discrete-flow baseline while only using 8 sampling steps. This approach results in up to 128 times faster sampling with similar-level modeling quality.

Conclusion: The proposed FS-DFM enables significant improvements in language generation speed without compromising quality, making it a highly efficient alternative to traditional methods in the space of discrete diffusion models.

Abstract: Autoregressive language models (ARMs) deliver strong likelihoods, but are
inherently serial: they generate one token per forward pass, which limits
throughput and inflates latency for long sequences. Diffusion Language Models
(DLMs) parallelize across positions and thus appear promising for language
generation, yet standard discrete diffusion typically needs hundreds to
thousands of model evaluations to reach high quality, trading serial depth for
iterative breadth. We introduce FS-DFM, Few-Step Discrete Flow-Matching. A
discrete flow-matching model designed for speed without sacrificing quality.
The core idea is simple: make the number of sampling steps an explicit
parameter and train the model to be consistent across step budgets, so one big
move lands where many small moves would. We pair this with a reliable update
rule that moves probability in the right direction without overshooting, and
with strong teacher guidance distilled from long-run trajectories. Together,
these choices make few-step sampling stable, accurate, and easy to control. On
language modeling benchmarks, FS-DFM with 8 sampling steps achieves perplexity
parity with a 1,024-step discrete-flow baseline for generating 1,024 tokens
using a similar-size model, delivering up to 128 times faster sampling and
corresponding latency/throughput gains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to forecast large language model performance from redacted task descriptions without dataset access, using the PRECOG benchmark. It achieves moderate prediction accuracy and proposes improvements for anticipatory evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating large language models is time-consuming and resource-intensive due to the need to build benchmarks and run experiments iteratively. The work explores if it’s possible to predict performance before conducting any trials.

Method: They create a dataset (PRECOG) with redacted task description-performance pairs and experiment with models that use retrieval modules for performance prediction. Zero-leakage testing is also conducted on unindexed datasets.

Result: Their model achieves mean absolute error as low as 8.7 on accuracy benchmarks. They show that stronger reasoning models diversify and iteratively query to gather evidence, while current models exhibit limited querying abilities.

Conclusion: Their corpus facilitates the exploration of anticipatory evaluation in large language model research, allowing smarter experiment prioritization and task difficulty estimation in advance.

Abstract: Progress in large language models is constrained by an evaluation bottleneck:
build a benchmark, evaluate models and settings, then iterate. We therefore ask
a simple question: can we forecast outcomes before running any experiments? We
study text-only performance forecasting: estimating a model's score from a
redacted task description and intended configuration, with no access to dataset
instances. To support systematic study, we curate PRECOG, a corpus of redacted
description-performance pairs spanning diverse tasks, domains, and metrics.
Experiments show the task is challenging but feasible: models equipped with a
retrieval module that excludes source papers achieve moderate prediction
performance with well-calibrated uncertainty, reaching mean absolute error as
low as 8.7 on the Accuracy subset at high-confidence thresholds. Our analysis
indicates that stronger reasoning models engage in diverse, iterative querying,
whereas current open-source models lag and often skip retrieval or gather
evidence with limited diversity. We further test a zero-leakage setting,
forecasting on newly released datasets or experiments before their papers are
indexed, where GPT-5 with built-in web search still attains nontrivial
prediction accuracy. Overall, our corpus and analyses offer an initial step
toward open-ended anticipatory evaluation, supporting difficulty estimation and
smarter experiment prioritization.

### [57] [Building Tailored Speech Recognizers for Japanese Speaking Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20655)
*Yotaro Kubo,Richard Sproat,Chihiro Taguchi,Llion Jones*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study develops methods for creating speech recognizers for Japanese speaking assessments by addressing data sparsity through multitask learning and model fusion, resulting in significant mora-label error rate reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Japanese speaking assessments require accurate phonemic transcriptions with accent markers, but limited annotated data makes achieving high accuracy challenging.

Method: Two methods were proposed: (1) multitask training with auxiliary loss functions to utilize partially annotated data, and (2) fusion of phonetic and text-based estimators using a finite-state transducer framework.

Result: The proposed methods significantly reduced mora-label error rates from 12.3% to 7.1% on the CSJ core evaluation sets, outperforming generic multilingual recognizers.

Conclusion: The combination of multitask learning and fusion methods effectively enhances phonemic recognition accuracy for Japanese speaking assessment tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents methods for building speech recognizers tailored for
Japanese speaking assessment tasks. Specifically, we build a speech recognizer
that outputs phonemic labels with accent markers. Although Japanese is
resource-rich, there is only a small amount of data for training models to
produce accurate phonemic transcriptions that include accent marks. We propose
two methods to mitigate data sparsity. First, a multitask training scheme
introduces auxiliary loss functions to estimate orthographic text labels and
pitch patterns of the input signal, so that utterances with only orthographic
annotations can be leveraged in training. The second fuses two estimators, one
over phonetic alphabet strings, and the other over text token sequences. To
combine these estimates we develop an algorithm based on the finite-state
transducer framework. Our results indicate that the use of multitask learning
and fusion is effective for building an accurate phonemic recognizer. We show
that this approach is advantageous compared to the use of generic multilingual
recognizers. The relative advantages of the proposed methods were also
compared. Our proposed methods reduced the average of mora-label error rates
from 12.3% to 7.1% over the CSJ core evaluation sets.

*Peng Zhou,Lai Hou Tim,Zhixiang Cheng,Kun Xie,Chaoyi Li,Wei Liu,Xiangxiang Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper integrates knowledge from large language models (LLMs) with structural representations from pre-trained molecular models to improve molecular property prediction (MPP), achieving better results than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve molecular property prediction (MPP) by addressing limitations in existing methods, such as relying heavily on either graph neural networks (GNNs) or large language models (LLMs) separate from molecular structural data.

Method: The proposed framework prompts LLMs to generate both domain knowledge and code for molecular vectorization. This knowledge-based feature is fused with structural features derived from pre-trained molecular models using state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and DeepSeek-R1.

Result: The integrated approach combining LLM-derived knowledge and molecular structural information significantly outperformed traditional methods across extensive experiments.

Conclusion: Integrating LLM-extracted knowledge with structural molecular features provides an effective way to enhance MPP, demonstrating the value of combining human-like knowledge extraction with data-driven approaches.

Abstract: Predicting molecular properties is a critical component of drug discovery.
Recent advances in deep learning, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs),
have enabled end-to-end learning from molecular structures, reducing reliance
on manual feature engineering. However, while GNNs and self-supervised learning
approaches have advanced molecular property prediction (MPP), the integration
of human prior knowledge remains indispensable, as evidenced by recent methods
that leverage large language models (LLMs) for knowledge extraction. Despite
their strengths, LLMs are constrained by knowledge gaps and hallucinations,
particularly for less-studied molecular properties. In this work, we propose a
novel framework that, for the first time, integrates knowledge extracted from
LLMs with structural features derived from pre-trained molecular models to
enhance MPP. Our approach prompts LLMs to generate both domain-relevant
knowledge and executable code for molecular vectorization, producing
knowledge-based features that are subsequently fused with structural
representations. We employ three state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and
DeepSeek-R1, for knowledge extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our integrated method outperforms existing approaches, confirming that the
combination of LLM-derived knowledge and structural information provides a
robust and effective solution for MPP.

### [59] [RedHerring Attack: Testing the Reliability of Attack Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20691)
*Jonathan Rusert*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the RedHerring attack, which compromises the reliability of adversarial text attack detectors by manipulating predictions, causing tension between classifier and detector.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to explore the reliability of adversarial text attack detection models, which hasn't been thoroughly investigated, despite their importance.

Method: It proposes the RedHerring attack to manipulate text, ensuring detectors misidentify it as adversarial while classifiers maintain correct predictions. The attack is tested on 4 datasets using 3 detectors and 4 classifiers.

Result: RedHerring significantly reduces detection accuracy by 20-71 points while maintaining or improving classifier accuracy.

Conclusion: The RedHerring threat model highlights vulnerabilities in detection models, motivating further research, and offers a preliminary defense mechanism based on a confidence check to improve detection accuracy without retraining.

Abstract: In response to adversarial text attacks, attack detection models have been
proposed and shown to successfully identify text modified by adversaries.
Attack detection models can be leveraged to provide an additional check for NLP
models and give signals for human input. However, the reliability of these
models has not yet been thoroughly explored. Thus, we propose and test a novel
attack setting and attack, RedHerring. RedHerring aims to make attack detection
models unreliable by modifying a text to cause the detection model to predict
an attack, while keeping the classifier correct. This creates a tension between
the classifier and detector. If a human sees that the detector is giving an
``incorrect'' prediction, but the classifier a correct one, then the human will
see the detector as unreliable. We test this novel threat model on 4 datasets
against 3 detectors defending 4 classifiers. We find that RedHerring is able to
drop detection accuracy between 20 - 71 points, while maintaining (or
improving) classifier accuracy. As an initial defense, we propose a simple
confidence check which requires no retraining of the classifier or detector and
increases detection accuracy greatly. This novel threat model offers new
insights into how adversaries may target detection models.

*Abhinay Shankar Belde,Rohit Ramkumar,Jonathan Rusert*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes Hybrid Select and Dynamic Select, two new attack strategies that reduce query numbers in adversarial text attacks without compromising effectiveness, addressing computational inefficiencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to solve the issue of expensive computational costs associated with adversarial text attacks in NLP due to the high complexity of transformer-based models and inefficient existing methods requiring many queries.

Method: They introduced two attack selection strategies: Hybrid Select (using a size threshold to combine BinarySelect and GreedySelect) and Dynamic Select (learning when to apply each method based on text length).

Result: The Hybrid Select method achieves an average of 25.82% reduction in queries required per attack across 4 datasets and 6 target models, including both encoder models and LLMs, while maintaining attack effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed methods provide a computationally efficient and effective solution to adversarial text attacks, enabling researchers with limited resources to better explore NLP model robustness.

Abstract: Adversarial text attack research plays a crucial role in evaluating the
robustness of NLP models. However, the increasing complexity of
transformer-based architectures has dramatically raised the computational cost
of attack testing, especially for researchers with limited resources (e.g.,
GPUs). Existing popular black-box attack methods often require a large number
of queries, which can make them inefficient and impractical for researchers. To
address these challenges, we propose two new attack selection strategies called
Hybrid and Dynamic Select, which better combine the strengths of previous
selection algorithms. Hybrid Select merges generalized BinarySelect techniques
with GreedySelect by introducing a size threshold to decide which selection
algorithm to use. Dynamic Select provides an alternative approach of combining
the generalized Binary and GreedySelect by learning which lengths of texts each
selection method should be applied to. This greatly reduces the number of
queries needed while maintaining attack effectiveness (a limitation of
BinarySelect). Across 4 datasets and 6 target models, our best
method(sentence-level Hybrid Select) is able to reduce the number of required
queries per attack up 25.82\% on average against both encoder models and LLMs,
without losing the effectiveness of the attack.

### [61] [MI-Fuse: Label Fusion for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation with Closed-Source Large-Audio Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20706)
*Hsiao-Ying Huang,Yi-Cheng Lin,Hung-yi Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework named MI-Fuse to adapt speech emotion recognition (SER) models when there is domain mismatch and limited access to powerful Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs). It enables a student model to outperform LALMs using only unlabeled target-domain audio.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SER models often fail under domain mismatch in real-world applications, especially when source-domain data are unavailable and LALMs are accessible only via API, creating a need for effective domain adaptation.

Method: MI-Fuse employs denoised label fusion, combining predictions from both LALM and a source-domain trained SER classifier, weighted by mutual-information-based uncertainty. It stabilizes training using an exponential moving average teacher.

Result: Experiments across multiple datasets and cross-domain transfers show the student model consistently surpasses LALM in performance, outperforming the strongest baseline by 3.9%.

Conclusion: MI-Fuse enables effective SER adaptation for real-world applications without requiring source-domain data or full LALM access, thereby strengthening emotion-aware speech systems under domain mismatch.

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) show strong zero-shot ability on speech
tasks, suggesting promise for speech emotion recognition (SER). However, SER in
real-world deployments often fails under domain mismatch, where source data are
unavailable and powerful LALMs are accessible only through an API. We ask:
given only unlabeled target-domain audio and an API-only LALM, can a student
model be adapted to outperform the LALM in the target domain? To this end, we
propose MI-Fuse, a denoised label fusion framework that supplements the LALM
with a source-domain trained SER classifier as an auxiliary teacher. The
framework draws multiple stochastic predictions from both teachers, weights
their mean distributions by mutual-information-based uncertainty, and
stabilizes training with an exponential moving average teacher. Experiments
across three public emotion datasets and six cross-domain transfers show
consistent gains, with the student surpassing the LALM and outperforming the
strongest baseline by 3.9%. This approach strengthens emotion-aware speech
systems without sharing source data, enabling realistic adaptation.

*Jinwook Park,Kangil Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses a limitation in unsupervised neural grammar induction, proposing a solution to enhance performance and reduce model size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models in unsupervised neural grammar induction face issues with large, underperforming grammars due to probability distribution collapse.

Method: The authors analyze the occurrence of probability distribution collapse and propose collapse-relaxing neural parameterization to mitigate it.

Result: Their approach improves parsing performance and allows for more compact grammars across various languages.

Conclusion: The analysis and proposed solution effectively address expressiveness limits in neural grammar induction, optimizing both size and performance.

Abstract: Unsupervised neural grammar induction aims to learn interpretable
hierarchical structures from language data. However, existing models face an
expressiveness bottleneck, often resulting in unnecessarily large yet
underperforming grammars. We identify a core issue, $\textit{probability
distribution collapse}$, as the underlying cause of this limitation. We analyze
when and how the collapse emerges across key components of neural
parameterization and introduce a targeted solution, $\textit{collapse-relaxing
neural parameterization}$, to mitigate it. Our approach substantially improves
parsing performance while enabling the use of significantly more compact
grammars across a wide range of languages, as demonstrated through extensive
empirical analysis.

*Youwon Jang,Woo Suk Choi,Minjoon Jung,Minsu Lee,Byoung-Tak Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes C2R, a training-free QA framework that refines answers based on confidence scores using sub-questions in text, image, and video domains, yielding better model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the reliability and robustness of QA models by leveraging sub-questions and their confidence scores without requiring additional training.

Method: C2R constructs and refines sub-questions (sub-QAs), evaluates their confidence scores, and strategically selects final answers by comparing these scores across diverse reasoning paths.

Result: C2R consistently enhances the performance of various existing QA models across multiple benchmarks and domains.

Conclusion: The integration of sub-questions and confidence-driven refinement significantly boosts QA system reliability, providing insights into the effects of sub-QA quality and quantity on reasoning outcomes.

Abstract: We propose Confidence-guided Refinement Reasoning (C2R), a novel
training-free framework applicable to question-answering (QA) tasks across
text, image, and video domains. C2R strategically constructs and refines
sub-questions and their answers (sub-QAs), deriving a better confidence score
for the target answer. C2R first curates a subset of sub-QAs to explore diverse
reasoning paths, then compares the confidence scores of the resulting answer
candidates to select the most reliable final answer. Since C2R relies solely on
confidence scores derived from the model itself, it can be seamlessly
integrated with various existing QA models, demonstrating consistent
performance improvements across diverse models and benchmarks. Furthermore, we
provide essential yet underexplored insights into how leveraging sub-QAs
affects model behavior, specifically analyzing the impact of both the quantity
and quality of sub-QAs on achieving robust and reliable reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study revisits the trade-off between domain-specific fine-tuning and general performance degradation in LLMs, proposing and validating strategies to mitigate these issues, including a new method called TALR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses the concern that supervised fine-tuning on domain-specific datasets often degrades the general capabilities of large language models, despite their improved performance on specialized tasks.

Method: The authors empirically evaluate strategies like using smaller learning rates and propose a new method, Token-Adaptive Loss Reweighting (TALR), supported by theoretical analysis. Additionally, they compare TALR with other methods such as L2 regularization, LoRA, and model averaging to balance general and domain-specific performances.

Result: Experimental findings reveal that while no approach completely eliminates the trade-off, the proposed TALR method consistently achieves a better balance between maintaining general capabilities and improving domain-specific performance compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The paper concludes with practical recommendations for effectively adapting LLMs to new domains: use smaller learning rates to balance trade-offs and consider TALR for a more robust strategy when a stronger balance is needed.

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on domain-specific datasets is a common approach
to adapt Large Language Models (LLMs) to specialized tasks but is often
believed to degrade their general capabilities. In this work, we revisit this
trade-off and present both empirical and theoretical insights. First, we show
that SFT does not always hurt: using a smaller learning rate can substantially
mitigate general performance degradation while preserving comparable
target-domain performance. We then provide a theoretical analysis that explains
these phenomena and further motivates a new method, Token-Adaptive Loss
Reweighting (TALR). Building on this, and recognizing that smaller learning
rates alone do not fully eliminate general-performance degradation in all
cases, we evaluate a range of strategies for reducing general capability loss,
including L2 regularization, LoRA, model averaging, FLOW, and our proposed
TALR. Experimental results demonstrate that while no method completely
eliminates the trade-off, TALR consistently outperforms these baselines in
balancing domain-specific gains and general capabilities. Finally, we distill
our findings into practical guidelines for adapting LLMs to new domains: (i)
using a small learning rate to achieve a favorable trade-off, and (ii) when a
stronger balance is further desired, adopt TALR as an effective strategy.

### [65] [Towards Atoms of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20784)
*Chenhui Hu,Pengfei Cao,Yubo Chen,Kang Liu,Jun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes the 'Atoms Theory' to define fundamental units in large language models (LLMs), addressing issues with existing units like neurons and features. It provides theoretical and empirical validations, showcasing its effectiveness in achieving sparse and stable representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current understanding of fundamental units in LLMs is limited, with neurons and features having significant drawbacks. The paper aims to address these limitations by developing a more reliable theoretical framework.

Method: The authors propose the Atoms Theory, introducing the atomic inner product (AIP) and defining conditions that ensure sparse and stable representations. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) with threshold activations are used for empirical validation.

Result: The method demonstrated 99.9% sparse reconstruction across layers in models like Gemma2-2B, Gemma2-9B, and Llama3.1-8B. Over 99.8% of atoms satisfied uniqueness conditions, outperforming neurons and features.

Conclusion: Atoms Theory provides a robust framework for understanding and interpreting the internal representations of LLMs, offering a significant improvement over previous approaches.

Abstract: The fundamental units of internal representations in large language models
(LLMs) remain undefined, limiting further understanding of their mechanisms.
Neurons or features are often regarded as such units, yet neurons suffer from
polysemy, while features face concerns of unreliable reconstruction and
instability. To address this issue, we propose the Atoms Theory, which defines
such units as atoms. We introduce the atomic inner product (AIP) to correct
representation shifting, formally define atoms, and prove the conditions that
atoms satisfy the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), ensuring stable sparse
representations over atom set and linking to compressed sensing. Under stronger
conditions, we further establish the uniqueness and exact $\ell_1$
recoverability of the sparse representations, and provide guarantees that
single-layer sparse autoencoders (SAEs) with threshold activations can reliably
identify the atoms. To validate the Atoms Theory, we train threshold-activated
SAEs on Gemma2-2B, Gemma2-9B, and Llama3.1-8B, achieving 99.9% sparse
reconstruction across layers on average, and more than 99.8% of atoms satisfy
the uniqueness condition, compared to 0.5% for neurons and 68.2% for features,
showing that atoms more faithfully capture intrinsic representations of LLMs.
Scaling experiments further reveal the link between SAEs size and recovery
capacity. Overall, this work systematically introduces and validates Atoms
Theory of LLMs, providing a theoretical framework for understanding internal
representations and a foundation for mechanistic interpretability. Code

### [66] [Few-Shot and Training-Free Review Generation via Conversational Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20805)
*Genki Kusano*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Conversational Prompting methods (SCP and CCP) for personalized review generation using few user reviews, leveraging large language models (LLMs) effectively without requiring training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of generating personalized reviews in real-world scenarios with limited user review data and without requiring additional model training.

Method: The authors propose Conversational Prompting, including two variants: Simple Conversational Prompting (SCP), which uses only the user's reviews; and Contrastive Conversational Prompting (CCP), which incorporates negative examples to refine the user's review style.

Result: Experiments across multiple domains and models demonstrated that SCP and CCP generated user-specific reviews outperforming traditional non-conversational prompts, even with minimal user data. CCP further improved accuracy when high-quality negative samples were available.

Conclusion: Conversational Prompting is an effective and practical solution for few-shot, training-free personalized review generation, especially in resource-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: Personalized review generation helps businesses understand user preferences,
yet most existing approaches assume extensive review histories of the target
user or require additional model training. Real-world applications often face
few-shot and training-free situations, where only a few user reviews are
available and fine-tuning is infeasible. It is well known that large language
models (LLMs) can address such low-resource settings, but their effectiveness
depends on prompt engineering. In this paper, we propose Conversational
Prompting, a lightweight method that reformulates user reviews as multi-turn
conversations. Its simple variant, Simple Conversational Prompting (SCP),
relies solely on the user's own reviews, while the contrastive variant,
Contrastive Conversational Prompting (CCP), inserts reviews from other users or
LLMs as incorrect replies and then asks the model to correct them, encouraging
the model to produce text in the user's style. Experiments on eight product
domains and five LLMs showed that the conventional non-conversational prompt
often produced reviews similar to those written by random users, based on
text-based metrics such as ROUGE-L and BERTScore, and application-oriented
tasks like user identity matching and sentiment analysis. In contrast, both SCP
and CCP produced reviews much closer to those of the target user, even when
each user had only two reviews. CCP brings further improvements when
high-quality negative examples are available, whereas SCP remains competitive
when such data cannot be collected. These results suggest that conversational
prompting offers a practical solution for review generation under few-shot and
training-free constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face challenges like hallucinations and factual errors in knowledge-intensive tasks due to a semantic gap between structured knowledge graphs and unstructured queries.

Method: The paper proposes the Enrich-on-Graph (EoG) framework which enriches knowledge graphs using LLMs' prior knowledge, ensuring efficient evidence extraction while maintaining computational efficiency and scalability.

Result: Experiments on two KGQA benchmark datasets demonstrate that EoG enhances the quality of KGs and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: EoG successfully bridges the semantic gap between KGs and queries, offering a scalable and robust solution for precise reasoning in knowledge graph question answering tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning capabilities in complex
tasks. However, they still struggle with hallucinations and factual errors in
knowledge-intensive scenarios like knowledge graph question answering (KGQA).
We attribute this to the semantic gap between structured knowledge graphs (KGs)
and unstructured queries, caused by inherent differences in their focuses and
structures. Existing methods usually employ resource-intensive, non-scalable
workflows reasoning on vanilla KGs, but overlook this gap. To address this
challenge, we propose a flexible framework, Enrich-on-Graph (EoG), which
leverages LLMs' prior knowledge to enrich KGs, bridge the semantic gap between
graphs and queries. EoG enables efficient evidence extraction from KGs for
precise and robust reasoning, while ensuring low computational costs,
scalability, and adaptability across different methods. Furthermore, we propose
three graph quality evaluation metrics to analyze query-graph alignment in KGQA
task, supported by theoretical validation of our optimization objectives.
Extensive experiments on two KGQA benchmark datasets indicate that EoG can
effectively generate high-quality KGs and achieve the state-of-the-art
performance. Our code and data are available at

*Taehee Park,Heejin Do,Gary Geunbae Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes PoCO, blending large models' recall strengths with smaller models' precision for better grammatical error correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small language models (sLMs) are precise but lack recall, while large language models (LLMs) overcorrect. The authors aim to combine their strengths.

Method: The proposed PoCO triggers overcorrection via LLMs for increased recall and applies targeted post-corrections using fine-tuned small models.

Result: Experiments show PoCO improves grammatical error correction by balancing recall and precision.

Conclusion: PoCO harmonizes small and large model advantages for better grammar correction quality.

Abstract: Robust supervised fine-tuned small Language Models (sLMs) often show high
reliability but tend to undercorrect. They achieve high precision at the cost
of low recall. Conversely, Large Language Models (LLMs) often show the opposite
tendency, making excessive overcorrection, leading to low precision. To
effectively harness the strengths of LLMs to address the recall challenges in
sLMs, we propose Post-Correction via Overcorrection (PoCO), a novel approach
that strategically balances recall and precision. PoCO first intentionally
triggers overcorrection via LLM to maximize recall by allowing comprehensive
revisions, then applies a targeted post-correction step via fine-tuning smaller
models to identify and refine erroneous outputs. We aim to harmonize both
aspects by leveraging the generative power of LLMs while preserving the
reliability of smaller supervised models. Our extensive experiments demonstrate
that PoCO effectively balances GEC performance by increasing recall with
competitive precision, ultimately improving the overall quality of grammatical
error correction.

TL;DR: The paper proposes 'cheat-sheet ICL,' a method that condenses many-shot examples into a short textual summary to reduce the computational costs of in-context learning while maintaining or improving task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) can perform effective in-context learning using many-shot examples, but this comes with high computational demands due to long input sequences.

Method: The paper introduces 'cheat-sheet ICL,' which distills information from many-shot examples into concise textual summaries used during inference, eliminating the need for extensive tokens or test-time retrieval.

Result: The proposed method achieves comparable or better performance than many-shot ICL on complex reasoning tasks, with significantly fewer tokens, and is on par with retrieval-based ICL without requiring retrieval.

Conclusion: Cheat-sheet ICL offers a practical and computationally efficient approach for utilizing LLMs in downstream applications, reducing token lengths without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) enable effective in-context
learning (ICL) with many-shot examples, but at the cost of high computational
demand due to longer input tokens. To address this, we propose cheat-sheet ICL,
which distills the information from many-shot ICL into a concise textual
summary (cheat sheet) used as the context at inference time. Experiments on
challenging reasoning tasks show that cheat-sheet ICL achieves comparable or
better performance than many-shot ICL with far fewer tokens, and matches
retrieval-based ICL without requiring test-time retrieval. These findings
demonstrate that cheat-sheet ICL is a practical alternative for leveraging LLMs
in downstream tasks.

*Shuo Huang,Xingliang Yuan,Gholamreza Haffari,Lizhen Qu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a zero-shot algorithm for sentence rewriting that enhances privacy in user inputs to large language models while maintaining text coherence and utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing use of LLMs in cloud-based services risks exposing sensitive user information, necessitating better text anonymization and de-identification methods.

Method: The proposed method employs a tree-search-based iterative algorithm leveraging reward models to rewrite sentences, systematically removing private information while preserving text quality.

Result: Experiments indicate substantial improvement over existing methods, achieving better trade-offs between privacy protection and text usefulness.

Conclusion: The introduced algorithm offers an effective solution to the challenge of anonymizing text for LLMs, balancing privacy and utility successfully.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) in cloud-based
services has raised significant privacy concerns, as user inputs may
inadvertently expose sensitive information. Existing text anonymization and
de-identification techniques, such as rule-based redaction and scrubbing, often
struggle to balance privacy preservation with text naturalness and utility. In
this work, we propose a zero-shot, tree-search-based iterative sentence
rewriting algorithm that systematically obfuscates or deletes private
information while preserving coherence, relevance, and naturalness. Our method
incrementally rewrites privacy-sensitive segments through a structured search
guided by a reward model, enabling dynamic exploration of the rewriting space.
Experiments on privacy-sensitive datasets show that our approach significantly
outperforms existing baselines, achieving a superior balance between privacy
protection and utility preservation.

*Guo Chen,Qiuyuan Li,Qiuxian Li,Hongliang Dai,Xiang Chen,Piji Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes an advanced method for generating concise and accurate sub-sentence citations in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) question answering systems, addressing existing citation issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current citation methods in RAG systems often provide sentence or paragraph-level references, which include irrelevant content or omit essential context, making validation difficult for users.

Method: The authors develop annotation guidelines for sub-sentence citations, construct a dataset, and propose a framework that uses LLMs for automated data generation and a credit model to filter low-quality examples.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method produces higher-quality, more readable citations compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: Generating citations at the sub-sentence level enhances user verifiability, reduces validation effort, and improves citation quality for LLM outputs.

Abstract: In retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) question answering systems,
generating citations for large language model (LLM) outputs enhances
verifiability and helps users identify potential hallucinations. However, we
observe two problems in the citations produced by existing attribution methods.
First, the citations are typically provided at the sentence or even paragraph
level. Long sentences or paragraphs may include a substantial amount of
irrelevant content. Second, sentence-level citations may omit information that
is essential for verifying the output, forcing users to read the surrounding
context. In this paper, we propose generating sub-sentence citations that are
both concise and sufficient, thereby reducing the effort required by users to
confirm the correctness of the generated output. To this end, we first develop
annotation guidelines for such citations and construct a corresponding dataset.
Then, we propose an attribution framework for generating citations that adhere
to our standards. This framework leverages LLMs to automatically generate
fine-tuning data for our task and employs a credit model to filter out
low-quality examples. Our experiments on the constructed dataset demonstrate
that the propose approach can generate high-quality and more readable
citations.

### [72] [WeFT: Weighted Entropy-driven Fine-Tuning for dLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20863)
*Guowei Xu,Wenxin Xu,Jiawang Zhao,Kaisheng Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes WeFT, a weighted supervised fine-tuning (SFT) method for diffusion language models, demonstrating significant performance improvements on reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised fine-tuning for diffusion models is challenging due to the lack of precise probability estimates at each denoising step. Additionally, diffusion models often produce less predictable and inconsistent outputs, necessitating a method to control key tokens that guide generation.

Method: The authors introduce WeFT, a technique that assigns weights to tokens based on their entropy during SFT of diffusion models to improve token control and reasoning consistency.

Result: The proposed WeFT approach achieves 39%, 64%, and 83% relative improvements over standard SFT on Sudoku, Countdown, GSM8K, and MATH-500 reasoning benchmarks, using different datasets.

Conclusion: WeFT effectively addresses the challenges of supervised fine-tuning in diffusion language models, yielding significant gains in reasoning tasks. Code and models will be released for further research.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown strong potential in language modeling,
offering faster generation compared to traditional autoregressive approaches.
However, applying supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to diffusion models remains
challenging, as they lack precise probability estimates at each denoising step.
While the diffusion mechanism enables the model to reason over entire
sequences, it also makes the generation process less predictable and often
inconsistent. This highlights the importance of controlling key tokens that
guide the direction of generation. To address this issue, we propose WeFT, a
weighted SFT method for diffusion language models, where tokens are assigned
different weights based on their entropy. Derived from diffusion theory, WeFT
delivers substantial gains: training on s1K, s1K-1.1, and 3k samples from
open-r1, it achieves relative improvements of 39%, 64%, and 83% over standard
SFT on four widely used reasoning benchmarks (Sudoku, Countdown, GSM8K, and
MATH-500). The code and models will be made publicly available.

### [73] [Single Answer is Not Enough: On Generating Ranked Lists with Medical Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20866)
*Pittawat Taveekitworachai,Natpatchara Pongjirapat,Krittaphas Chaisutyakorn,Piyalitt Ittichaiwong,Tossaporn Saengja,Kunat Pipatanakul*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how medical reasoning models (MRMs) can generate ranked answer lists for open-ended clinical questions using two approaches: prompting and fine-tuning (including supervised and reinforcement). The study finds reinforcement fine-tuned models to be more robust across multiple answer formats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In clinical decision-making, multiple answer options help reduce narrow perspectives, but current MRMs are primarily trained to generate single answers, even for open-ended questions.

Method: The study investigates prompting as a cost-effective method and uses supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) to train MRMs to produce ranked lists. New reward functions for RFT are proposed, and ablation studies are conducted.

Result: Reinforcement fine-tuned models outperform others in robustness across different answer formats. A case study on a modified MedQA dataset shows these MRMs can identify multiple valid answers but may miss benchmark-preferred ones.

Conclusion: The paper highlights ranked-list answer generation as a valuable alternative format for MRMs, which can improve clinical reasoning outcomes by accommodating multiple valid responses.

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic study on enabling medical reasoning models
(MRMs) to generate ranked lists of answers for open-ended questions. Clinical
decision-making rarely relies on a single answer but instead considers multiple
options, reducing the risks of narrow perspectives. Yet current MRMs are
typically trained to produce only one answer, even in open-ended settings. We
propose an alternative format: ranked lists and investigate two approaches:
prompting and fine-tuning. While prompting is a cost-effective way to steer an
MRM's response, not all MRMs generalize well across different answer formats:
choice, short text, and list answers. Based on our prompting findings, we train
and evaluate MRMs using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT). SFT teaches a model to imitate annotated responses, and RFT
incentivizes exploration through the responses that maximize a reward. We
propose new reward functions targeted at ranked-list answer formats, and
conduct ablation studies for RFT. Our results show that while some SFT models
generalize to certain answer formats, models trained with RFT are more robust
across multiple formats. We also present a case study on a modified MedQA with
multiple valid answers, finding that although MRMs might fail to select the
benchmark's preferred ground truth, they can recognize valid answers. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic investigation of approaches
for enabling MRMs to generate answers as ranked lists. We hope this work
provides a first step toward developing alternative answer formats that are
beneficial beyond single answers in medical domains.

### [74] [Learning to Summarize by Learning to Quiz: Adversarial Agentic Collaboration for Long Document Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20900)
*Weixuan Wang,Minghao Wu,Barry Haddow,Alexandra Birch*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SummQ, an adversarial multi-agent framework for improving long document summarization, employing collaborative intelligence between summarization and quizzing agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large language models struggle with summarizing excessively long documents due to issues like information loss, factual inconsistencies, and coherence problems.

Method: SummQ uses a multi-agent framework with summary generators, reviewers, quiz generators, reviewers, and an examinee agent. These interact adversarially to iteratively refine document summaries through continuous feedback.

Result: SummQ outperforms state-of-the-art methods on long document summarization benchmarks based on ROUGE, BERTScore, and evaluations by humans and LLMs.

Conclusion: The multi-agent adversarial collaboration introduced in SummQ effectively enhances long document summarization, setting a new standard for summarization quality.

Abstract: Long document summarization remains a significant challenge for current large
language models (LLMs), as existing approaches commonly struggle with
information loss, factual inconsistencies, and coherence issues when processing
excessively long documents. We propose SummQ, a novel adversarial multi-agent
framework that addresses these limitations through collaborative intelligence
between specialized agents operating in two complementary domains:
summarization and quizzing. Our approach employs summary generators and
reviewers that work collaboratively to create and evaluate comprehensive
summaries, while quiz generators and reviewers create comprehension questions
that serve as continuous quality checks for the summarization process. This
adversarial dynamic, enhanced by an examinee agent that validates whether the
generated summary contains the information needed to answer the quiz questions,
enables iterative refinement through multifaceted feedback mechanisms. We
evaluate SummQ on three widely used long document summarization benchmarks.
Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms
existing state-of-the-art methods across ROUGE and BERTScore metrics, as well
as in LLM-as-a-Judge and human evaluations. Our comprehensive analyses reveal
the effectiveness of the multi-agent collaboration dynamics, the influence of
different agent configurations, and the impact of the quizzing mechanism. This
work establishes a new approach for long document summarization that uses
adversarial agentic collaboration to improve summarization quality.

### [75] [MemLens: Uncovering Memorization in LLMs with Activation Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20909)
*Zirui He,Haiyan Zhao,Ali Payani,Mengnan du*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MemLens detects memorization in large language models by analyzing numeric token probability trajectories, distinguishing between clean and contaminated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation metrics for LLMs may involve contaminated benchmarks, and existing detection methods are inadequate, especially for implicitly contaminated data.

Method: MemLens examines probability trajectories of numeric tokens during the generation process, identifying clear patterns of reasoning in contaminated versus clean data by activation analysis.

Result: MemLens identifies distinct 'shortcut' behaviors in contaminated data and validates findings via controlled LoRA fine-tuning experiments.

Conclusion: MemLens effectively captures signals of memorization, distinguishing contaminated from clean data and addressing limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are commonly evaluated on challenging benchmarks
such as AIME and Math500, which are susceptible to contamination and risk of
being memorized. Existing detection methods, which primarily rely on
surface-level lexical overlap and perplexity, demonstrate low generalization
and degrade significantly when encountering implicitly contaminated data. In
this paper, we propose MemLens (An Activation Lens for Memorization Detection)
to detect memorization by analyzing the probability trajectories of numeric
tokens during generation. Our method reveals that contaminated samples exhibit
``shortcut'' behaviors, locking onto an answer with high confidence in the
model's early layers, whereas clean samples show more gradual evidence
accumulation across the model's full depth. We observe that contaminated and
clean samples exhibit distinct and well-separated reasoning trajectories. To
further validate this, we inject carefully designed samples into the model
through LoRA fine-tuning and observe the same trajectory patterns as in
naturally contaminated data. These results provide strong evidence that MemLens
captures genuine signals of memorization rather than spurious correlations.

### [76] [Tool Calling for Arabic LLMs: Data Strategies and Instruction Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20957)
*Asim Ersoy,Enes Altinisik,Husrev Taha Sencar,Kareem Darwish*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines how well Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform tool-calling tasks in Arabic, addressing three key research questions, and conducts experiments using adapted Arabic tool-calling datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of research and resources for enabling tool-calling capabilities in languages other than English, specifically Arabic.

Method: The study translates and adapts two open-source tool-calling datasets into Arabic and performs experiments on base and post-trained versions of an Arabic LLM.

Result: The research provides essential insights into developing effective strategies for Arabic tool-calling performance, examining cross-lingual data transfer, instruction tuning, and fine-tuning on specific tools.

Conclusion: The findings highlight strategies to enhance the tool-calling abilities of Arabic LLMs, contributing to better resource utilization and improved multilingual AI capabilities.

Abstract: Tool calling is a critical capability that allows Large Language Models
(LLMs) to interact with external systems, significantly expanding their
utility. However, research and resources for tool calling are predominantly
English-centric, leaving a gap in our understanding of how to enable this
functionality for other languages, such as Arabic. This paper investigates
three key research questions: (1) the necessity of in-language (Arabic)
tool-calling data versus relying on cross-lingual transfer, (2) the effect of
general-purpose instruction tuning on tool-calling performance, and (3) the
value of fine-tuning on specific, high-priority tools. To address these
questions, we conduct extensive experiments using base and post-trained
variants of an open-weight Arabic LLM. To enable this study, we bridge the
resource gap by translating and adapting two open-source tool-calling datasets
into Arabic. Our findings provide crucial insights into the optimal strategies
for developing robust tool-augmented agents for Arabic.

### [77] [Analysis of instruction-based LLMs' capabilities to score and judge text-input problems in an academic setting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20982)
*Valeria Ramirez-Garcia,David de-Fitero-Dominguez,Antonio Garcia-Cabot,Eva Garcia-Lopez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the use of large language models (LLMs) for automatic evaluation of academic Text-Input Problems using rubrics. It compares five proposed evaluation systems on answers from computer science higher education students, finding that the Reference Aided Evaluation method shows the best alignment with human evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the capability of LLMs as effective evaluators in academic settings by utilizing rubrics and improving upon existing evaluation methodologies.

Method: Five evaluation systems were proposed and tested with three different LLMs (JudgeLM, Llama-3.1-8B, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B) on a dataset of answers to Text-Input Problems. Evaluation systems include JudgeLM Evaluation, Reference Aided Evaluation, No Reference Evaluation, Additive Evaluation, and Adaptive Evaluation.

Result: Reference Aided Evaluation outperformed other methods, showing the lowest median absolute deviation (0.945) and root mean square deviation (1.214) when compared to human evaluators. Other methods faced limitations like poor performance in concise answers or lack of necessary information for assessment.

Conclusion: LLM-driven automatic evaluation systems, when supported by effective methodologies like Reference Aided Evaluation, possess the potential to act as supplementary tools in academic evaluation. However, certain methods still face limitations and require further refinement.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can act as evaluators, a role studied by methods
like LLM-as-a-Judge and fine-tuned judging LLMs. In the field of education,
LLMs have been studied as assistant tools for students and teachers. Our
research investigates LLM-driven automatic evaluation systems for academic
Text-Input Problems using rubrics. We propose five evaluation systems that have
been tested on a custom dataset of 110 answers about computer science from
higher education students with three models: JudgeLM, Llama-3.1-8B and
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B. The evaluation systems include: The JudgeLM
evaluation, which uses the model's single answer prompt to obtain a score;
Reference Aided Evaluation, which uses a correct answer as a guide aside from
the original context of the question; No Reference Evaluation, which ommits the
reference answer; Additive Evaluation, which uses atomic criteria; and Adaptive
Evaluation, which is an evaluation done with generated criteria fitted to each
question. All evaluation methods have been compared with the results of a human
evaluator. Results show that the best method to automatically evaluate and
score Text-Input Problems using LLMs is Reference Aided Evaluation. With the
lowest median absolute deviation (0.945) and the lowest root mean square
deviation (1.214) when compared to human evaluation, Reference Aided Evaluation
offers fair scoring as well as insightful and complete evaluations. Other
methods such as Additive and Adaptive Evaluation fail to provide good results
in concise answers, No Reference Evaluation lacks information needed to
correctly assess questions and JudgeLM Evaluations have not provided good
results due to the model's limitations. As a result, we conclude that
Artificial Intelligence-driven automatic evaluation systems, aided with proper
methodologies, show potential to work as complementary tools to other academic
resources.

### [78] [Generative AI for FFRDCs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21040)
*Arun S. Maiya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores using large language models (LLMs) to automate summarization and analysis for FFRDC workloads, applying an open-source framework for secure AI deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FFRDCs deal with extensive text-heavy workloads that are cumbersome to analyze manually. The motivation is to enhance efficiency and speed while maintaining security in sensitive government applications.

Method: The paper applies large language models for tasks like summarization, classification, extraction, and sense-making. It utilizes OnPrem.LLM, a framework designed for secure, open-source AI use, suitable for sensitive contexts.

Result: Case studies on defense policy documents (NDAA) and scientific datasets (NSF Awards) demonstrate that this approach improves oversight and strategic analysis. It achieves these goals without compromising data sovereignty or auditability.

Conclusion: Large language models, when used with secure frameworks like OnPrem.LLM, can significantly enhance the efficiency of analyzing text-heavy workloads in sensitive domains, balancing utility with security.

Abstract: Federally funded research and development centers (FFRDCs) face text-heavy
workloads, from policy documents to scientific and engineering papers, that are
slow to analyze manually. We show how large language models can accelerate
summarization, classification, extraction, and sense-making with only a few
input-output examples. To enable use in sensitive government contexts, we apply
OnPrem$.$LLM, an open-source framework for secure and flexible application of
generative AI. Case studies on defense policy documents and scientific corpora,
including the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) and National Science
Foundation (NSF) Awards, demonstrate how this approach enhances oversight and
strategic analysis while maintaining auditability and data sovereignty.

### [79] [Behind RoPE: How Does Causal Mask Encode Positional Information?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21042)
*Junu Kim,Xiao Liu,Zhenghao Lin,Lei Ji,Yeyun Gong,Edward Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that the causal mask in Transformer decoders inherently provides positional information, independent of explicit positional encodings like RoPE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate how the causal mask in Transformer decoders impacts positional information and interacts with explicit positional encodings.

Method: The study uses theoretical and empirical analysis to observe position-dependent attention patterns induced by the causal mask and their interaction with RoPE positional encodings.

Result: It is shown that the causal mask induces position-dependent attention patterns similar to explicit positional encodings. Additionally, the RoPE and causal mask interaction distorts relative attention score patterns into non-relative ones.

Conclusion: The causal mask serves as a significant source of positional information, which must be carefully considered alongside explicit encodings for optimal model performance.

Abstract: While explicit positional encodings such as RoPE are a primary source of
positional information in Transformer decoders, the causal mask also provides
positional information. In this work, we prove that the causal mask can induce
position-dependent patterns in attention scores, even without parameters or
causal dependency in the input. Our theoretical analysis indicates that the
induced attention pattern tends to favor nearby query-key pairs, mirroring the
behavior of common positional encodings. Empirical analysis confirms that
trained models exhibit the same behavior, with learned parameters further
amplifying these patterns. Notably, we found that the interaction of causal
mask and RoPE distorts RoPE's relative attention score patterns into
non-relative ones. We consistently observed this effect in modern large
language models, suggesting the importance of considering the causal mask as a
source of positional information alongside explicit positional encodings.

*Keno Harada,Yudai Yamazaki,Masachika Taniguchi,Edison Marrese-Taylor,Takeshi Kojima,Yusuke Iwasawa,Yutaka Matsuo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces benchmarks for evaluating the performance of large language models (LLMs) in following multiple instructions simultaneously in text and code generation tasks, finding degradation in performance as instruction count increases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the critical challenge of assessing LLMs' ability to effectively handle real-world scenarios with multiple simultaneous instructions.

Method: Two benchmarks (ManyIFEval for text generation and StyleMBPP for code generation) were created, along with regression models to predict the performance of LLMs in unseen instruction combinations and counts.

Result: Performance of LLMs consistently degraded as the number of instructions increased. Logistic regression models effectively predicted multi-instruction performance with about 10% error.

Conclusion: Using modest sample sizes, the benchmarks and models provide an efficient framework for evaluating LLMs' abilities to handle multiple instructions, emphasizing practical scalability.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to real-world
scenarios, it becomes crucial to understand their ability to follow multiple
instructions simultaneously. To systematically evaluate these capabilities, we
introduce two specialized benchmarks for fundamental domains where multiple
instructions following is important: Many Instruction-Following Eval
(ManyIFEval) for text generation with up to ten instructions, and Style-aware
Mostly Basic Programming Problems (StyleMBPP) for code generation with up to
six instructions. Our experiments with the created benchmarks across ten LLMs
reveal that performance consistently degrades as the number of instructions
increases. Furthermore, given the fact that evaluating all the possible
combinations of multiple instructions is computationally impractical in actual
use cases, we developed three types of regression models that can estimate
performance on both unseen instruction combinations and different numbers of
instructions which are not used during training. We demonstrate that a logistic
regression model using instruction count as an explanatory variable can predict
performance of following multiple instructions with approximately 10% error,
even for unseen instruction combinations. We show that relatively modest sample
sizes (500 for ManyIFEval and 300 for StyleMBPP) are sufficient for performance
estimation, enabling efficient evaluation of LLMs under various instruction
combinations.

*Qixin Wan,Zilong Wang,Jingwen Zhou,Wanting Wang,Ziheng Geng,Jiachen Liu,Ran Cao,Minghui Cheng,Lu Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces SoM-1K, a multimodal benchmark dataset to evaluate foundation models on engineering problems related to the strength of materials. The study finds limitations in models' visual reasoning and proposes a novel textual prompting strategy (DoI).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models perform well in various domains, but their capability to solve sophisticated multimodal engineering problems has not been thoroughly investigated.

Method: The authors designed the SoM-1K dataset with 1,065 annotated engineering problems involving text and diagrams and experimented with eight foundation models using a prompting strategy called Descriptions of Images (DoI) for diagrams.

Result: The best-performing model achieved only 56.6% accuracy, and LLMs paired with DoI often outperformed VLMs that directly processed visual diagrams.

Conclusion: Accurate textual descriptions (DoI) are more effective than direct image inputs for solving multimodal engineering problems, underscoring the need for improved multimodal reasoning capabilities in foundation models.

Abstract: Foundation models have shown remarkable capabilities in various domains, but
their performance on complex, multimodal engineering problems remains largely
unexplored. We introduce SoM-1K, the first large-scale multimodal benchmark
dataset dedicated to evaluating foundation models on problems in the strength
of materials (SoM). The dataset, which contains 1,065 annotated SoM problems,
mirrors real-world engineering tasks by including both textual problem
statements and schematic diagrams. Due to the limited capabilities of current
foundation models in understanding complicated visual information, we propose a
novel prompting strategy called Descriptions of Images (DoI), which provides
rigorous expert-generated text descriptions of the visual diagrams as the
context. We evaluate eight representative foundation models, including both
large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs). Our results
show that current foundation models struggle significantly with these
engineering problems, with the best-performing model achieving only 56.6%
accuracy. Interestingly, we found that LLMs, when provided with DoI, often
outperform VLMs provided with visual diagrams. A detailed error analysis
reveals that DoI plays a crucial role in mitigating visual misinterpretation
errors, suggesting that accurate text-based descriptions can be more effective
than direct image input for current foundation models. This work establishes a
rigorous benchmark for engineering AI and highlights a critical need for
developing more robust multimodal reasoning capabilities in foundation models,
particularly in scientific and engineering contexts.

### [82] [Which Cultural Lens Do Models Adopt? On Cultural Positioning Bias and Agentic Mitigation in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21080)
*Yixin Wan,Xingrun Chen,Kai-Wei Chang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper identifies and addresses a cultural bias in large language models (LLMs), where they favor mainstream U.S. culture and overlook non-mainstream ones. It introduces the CultureLens benchmark and mitigation methods to counteract this bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind the paper is to address the subtle cultural bias in LLMs, where these models default to a mainstream U.S. cultural perspective in their generative tasks, marginalizing non-mainstream cultures.

Method: The authors propose the CultureLens benchmark with 4,000 prompts and three evaluation metrics to measure the cultural positioning bias in LLMs. They also introduce two mitigation methods: a baseline prompt-based Fairness Intervention Pillars (FIP) method and a structured Mitigation via Fairness Agents (MFA) framework with two pipelines (Single-Agent and Multi-Agent).

Result: Evaluation of five state-of-the-art LLMs using the CultureLens benchmark showed a significant bias: over 88% of scripts for U.S. contexts adopted insider tones, while non-mainstream cultures were treated as outsiders. The proposed mitigation methods demonstrated promising effectiveness in reducing these biases.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit notable cultural positioning biases favoring mainstream U.S. perspectives. Structured agent-based frameworks like MFA show potential for reducing these biases and enhancing fairness in generative tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have unlocked a wide range of downstream
generative applications. However, we found that they also risk perpetuating
subtle fairness issues tied to culture, positioning their generations from the
perspectives of the mainstream US culture while demonstrating salient
externality towards non-mainstream ones. In this work, we identify and
systematically investigate this novel culture positioning bias, in which an
LLM's default generative stance aligns with a mainstream view and treats other
cultures as outsiders. We propose the CultureLens benchmark with 4000
generation prompts and 3 evaluation metrics for quantifying this bias through
the lens of a culturally situated interview script generation task, in which an
LLM is positioned as an onsite reporter interviewing local people across 10
diverse cultures. Empirical evaluation on 5 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals a
stark pattern: while models adopt insider tones in over 88 percent of
US-contexted scripts on average, they disproportionately adopt mainly outsider
stances for less dominant cultures. To resolve these biases, we propose 2
inference-time mitigation methods: a baseline prompt-based Fairness
Intervention Pillars (FIP) method, and a structured Mitigation via Fairness
Agents (MFA) framework consisting of 2 pipelines: (1) MFA-SA (Single-Agent)
introduces a self-reflection and rewriting loop based on fairness guidelines.
(2) MFA-MA (Multi-Agent) structures the process into a hierarchy of specialized
agents: a Planner Agent(initial script generation), a Critique Agent (evaluates
initial script against fairness pillars), and a Refinement Agent (incorporates
feedback to produce a polished, unbiased script). Empirical results showcase
the effectiveness of agent-based methods as a promising direction for
mitigating biases in generative LLMs.

*Mohammad Hosseini,Kimia Hosseini,Shayan Bali,Zahra Zanjani,Saeedeh Momtazi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PerHalluEval, a benchmark for evaluating hallucinations in Persian-language LLMs, revealing challenges across models and partial mitigation by providing external knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the persistent problem of hallucinations in large language models, especially in low-resource languages like Persian.

Method: PerHalluEval is a benchmark employing a three-stage pipeline with LLM-driven processes and human validation to assess hallucinated content in QA and summarization tasks, incorporating Persian-specific contexts and log probability analysis.

Result: Evaluation of 12 LLMs showed difficulty in detecting hallucinated Persian text, and no significant advantage for Persian-trained models over others. External knowledge partially reduced hallucinations.

Conclusion: LLMs struggle with hallucinations in the Persian language, and while external knowledge helps, training models specifically for Persian doesn't significantly improve performance.

Abstract: Hallucination is a persistent issue affecting all large language Models
(LLMs), particularly within low-resource languages such as Persian.
PerHalluEval (Persian Hallucination Evaluation) is the first dynamic
hallucination evaluation benchmark tailored for the Persian language. Our
benchmark leverages a three-stage LLM-driven pipeline, augmented with human
validation, to generate plausible answers and summaries regarding QA and
summarization tasks, focusing on detecting extrinsic and intrinsic
hallucinations. Moreover, we used the log probabilities of generated tokens to
select the most believable hallucinated instances. In addition, we engaged
human annotators to highlight Persian-specific contexts in the QA dataset in
order to evaluate LLMs' performance on content specifically related to Persian
culture. Our evaluation of 12 LLMs, including open- and closed-source models
using PerHalluEval, revealed that the models generally struggle in detecting
hallucinated Persian text. We showed that providing external knowledge, i.e.,
the original document for the summarization task, could mitigate hallucination
partially. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in terms of
hallucination when comparing LLMs specifically trained for Persian with others.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces BESPOKE, a benchmark to evaluate personalization in search-augmented large language models (LLMs) using human-annotated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve LLMs for diverse user needs by addressing limitations in personalized response generation beyond simple query understanding.

Method: BESPOKE collects human-authored chat and search histories, paired with preferences, for systematic evaluation with fine-grained feedback.

Result: Results show insights into the key elements required for effective personalization in information-seeking tasks.

Conclusion: BESPOKE provides a robust foundation for evaluating and advancing personalized search-augmented LLMs, with the resources open for community use.

Abstract: Search-augmented large language models (LLMs) have advanced
information-seeking tasks by integrating retrieval into generation, reducing
users' cognitive burden compared to traditional search systems. Yet they remain
insufficient for fully addressing diverse user needs, which requires
recognizing how the same query can reflect different intents across users and
delivering information in preferred forms. While recent systems such as ChatGPT
and Gemini attempt personalization by leveraging user histories, systematic
evaluation of such personalization is under-explored. To address this gap, we
propose BESPOKE, the realistic benchmark for evaluating personalization in
search-augmented LLMs. BESPOKE is designed to be both realistic, by collecting
authentic chat and search histories directly from humans, and diagnostic, by
pairing responses with fine-grained preference scores and feedback. The
benchmark is constructed through long-term, deeply engaged human annotation,
where human annotators contributed their own histories, authored queries with
detailed information needs, and evaluated responses with scores and diagnostic
feedback. Leveraging BESPOKE, we conduct systematic analyses that reveal key
requirements for effective personalization in information-seeking tasks,
providing a foundation for fine-grained evaluation of personalized
search-augmented LLMs. Our code and data are available at

*Junhyuk Choi,Ro-hoon Oh,Jihwan Seol,Bugeun Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VoiceBBQ extends the BBQ bias benchmark to spoken language, evaluating content and acoustic biases in Spoken Language Models (SLMs) using controlled voice conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the unique challenges of social bias in SLMs, which can emerge not only from content but also from speech acoustics.

Method: VoiceBBQ converts the textual BBQ dataset into controlled voice conditions to measure per-axis accuracy, bias, and consistency, facilitating direct comparison to the original text.

Result: Tests on LLaMA-Omni and Qwen2-Audio reveal that LLaMA-Omni resists acoustic bias but amplifies gender/accent bias, while Qwen2-Audio dampens acoustic cues but maintains content fidelity.

Conclusion: VoiceBBQ serves as an essential, compact benchmarking tool for analyzing both content and acoustic bias in spoken language models.

Abstract: We introduce VoiceBBQ, a spoken extension of the BBQ (Bias Benchmark for
Question Answering) - a dataset that measures social bias by presenting
ambiguous or disambiguated contexts followed by questions that may elicit
stereotypical responses. Due to the nature of speech, social bias in Spoken
Language Models (SLMs) can emerge from two distinct sources: 1) content aspect
and 2) acoustic aspect. The dataset converts every BBQ context into controlled
voice conditions, enabling per-axis accuracy, bias, and consistency scores that
remain comparable to the original text benchmark. Using VoiceBBQ, we evaluate
two SLMs - LLaMA-Omni and Qwen2-Audio - and observe architectural contrasts:
LLaMA-Omni resists acoustic bias while amplifying gender and accent bias,
whereas Qwen2-Audio substantially dampens these cues while preserving content
fidelity. VoiceBBQ thus provides a compact, drop-in testbed for jointly
diagnosing content and acoustic bias across spoken language models.

*Junhyuk Choi,Jihwan Seol,Nayeon Kim,Chanhee Cho,EunBin Cho,Bugeun Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses gender bias in Speech-aware Language Models (SpeechLMs) and introduces a dataset for systematic analysis, revealing paradoxical patterns in gender-related questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate and address gender-related biases in SpeechLMs that can affect response fairness and contextual appropriateness.

Method: They developed a new dataset with 9,208 speech samples across three gender-related categories and evaluated the LLaMA-Omni series models, analyzing their responses.

Result: The study found paradoxical gender response patterns in SpeechLMs, influenced by male-oriented acoustic tokens generated by Whisper speech encoders.

Conclusion: Current SpeechLMs fail to effectively eliminate gender biases, necessitating improved techniques for handling gender information in speech-based AI.

Abstract: Speech-aware Language Models (SpeechLMs) have fundamentally transformed
human-AI interaction by enabling voice-based communication, yet they may
exhibit acoustic-based gender differentiation where identical questions lead to
different responses based on the speaker's gender. This paper propose a new
dataset that enables systematic analysis of this phenomenon, containing 9,208
speech samples across three categories: Gender-Independent,
Gender-Stereotypical, and Gender-Dependent. We further evaluated LLaMA-Omni
series and discovered a paradoxical pattern; while overall responses seems
identical regardless of gender, the pattern is far from unbiased responses.
Specifically, in Gender-Stereotypical questions, all models consistently
exhibited male-oriented responses; meanwhile, in Gender-Dependent questions
where gender differentiation would be contextually appropriate, models
exhibited responses independent to gender instead. We also confirm that this
pattern does not result from neutral options nor perceived gender of a voice.
When we allow neutral response, models tends to respond neutrally also in
Gender-Dependent questions. The paradoxical pattern yet retains when we applied
gender neutralization methods on speech. Through comparison between SpeechLMs
with corresponding backbone LLMs, we confirmed that these paradoxical patterns
primarily stem from Whisper speech encoders, which generates male-oriented
acoustic tokens. These findings reveal that current SpeechLMs may not
successfully remove gender biases though they prioritized general fairness
principles over contextual appropriateness, highlighting the need for more
sophisticated techniques to utilize gender information properly in speech
technology.

### [88] [Retrieval over Classification: Integrating Relation Semantics for Multimodal Relation Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21151)
*Lei Hei,Tingjing Liao,Yingxin Pei,Yiyang Qi,Jiaqi Wang,Ruiting Li,Feiliang Ren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a retrieval-based framework (ROC) to enhance multimodal relation extraction, focusing on semantic understanding and structural constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most multimodal relation extraction approaches rely on classification paradigms, which ignore entity type and positional cues and lack nuanced semantic understanding.

Method: ROC reformulates the relation extraction process as a retrieval task using a multimodal encoder to integrate structural cues, expanding relation labels with natural language descriptions and leveraging contrastive learning for semantic alignment.

Result: The proposed ROC framework achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets MNRE and MORE, demonstrating improved robustness and interpretability.

Conclusion: ROC addresses limitations of traditional classification paradigms in multimodal relation extraction, offering a semantically rich, high-performing, and interpretable solution.

Abstract: Relation extraction (RE) aims to identify semantic relations between entities
in unstructured text. Although recent work extends traditional RE to multimodal
scenarios, most approaches still adopt classification-based paradigms with
fused multimodal features, representing relations as discrete labels. This
paradigm has two significant limitations: (1) it overlooks structural
constraints like entity types and positional cues, and (2) it lacks semantic
expressiveness for fine-grained relation understanding. We propose
\underline{R}etrieval \underline{O}ver \underline{C}lassification (ROC), a
novel framework that reformulates multimodal RE as a retrieval task driven by
relation semantics. ROC integrates entity type and positional information
through a multimodal encoder, expands relation labels into natural language
descriptions using a large language model, and aligns entity-relation pairs via
semantic similarity-based contrastive learning. Experiments show that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark datasets MNRE and
MORE and exhibits stronger robustness and interpretability.

*Chantal Shaib,Vinith M. Suriyakumar,Levent Sagun,Byron C. Wallace,Marzyeh Ghassemi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how syntactic templates can create spurious correlations between syntax and domain, which may override semantics in task instruction responses for LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address the impact of unintended syntactic-domain correlations on the performance and safety of LLMs.

Method: Using synthetic datasets and an evaluation framework, the study examines how syntax influences domain association in LLMs, and tests this phenomenon on models like GPT-4o and OLMo-2.

Result: Syntactic-domain correlation reduces entity knowledge task performance and can bypass safety refusals in specific LLMs, demonstrating risks in training and prompt handling.

Conclusion: Explicit testing for syntactic-domain correlations and ensuring syntactic diversity within training data are critical to mitigate these risks.

Abstract: For an LLM to correctly respond to an instruction it must understand both the
semantics and the domain (i.e., subject area) of a given task-instruction pair.
However, syntax can also convey implicit information Recent work shows that
syntactic templates--frequent sequences of Part-of-Speech (PoS) tags--are
prevalent in training data and often appear in model outputs. In this work we
characterize syntactic templates, domain, and semantics in task-instruction
pairs. We identify cases of spurious correlations between syntax and domain,
where models learn to associate a domain with syntax during training; this can
sometimes override prompt semantics. Using a synthetic training dataset, we
find that the syntactic-domain correlation can lower performance (mean 0.51 +/-
0.06) on entity knowledge tasks in OLMo-2 models (1B-13B). We introduce an
evaluation framework to detect this phenomenon in trained models, and show that
it occurs on a subset of the FlanV2 dataset in open (OLMo-2-7B;
Llama-4-Maverick), and closed (GPT-4o) models. Finally, we present a case study
on the implications for safety finetuning, showing that unintended
syntactic-domain correlations can be used to bypass refusals in OLMo-2-7B
Instruct and GPT-4o. Our findings highlight two needs: (1) to explicitly test
for syntactic-domain correlations, and (2) to ensure syntactic diversity in
training data, specifically within domains, to prevent such spurious
correlations.

*Tyler Loakman,William Thorne,Chenghua Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Humour creation and perception pose significant challenges in NLP due to its abstract and context-sensitive nature, and existing models struggle to match human capabilities. This paper surveys work on generative humour tasks and highlights areas for future research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humour is a complex, context-dependent construct that tests common-sense reasoning and creativity, making it a critical task for evaluating LLMs' capabilities.

Method: The paper conducts a literature survey focused on computational humour in generative tasks, particularly creation and explanation, and examines its state and challenges.

Result: Despite its significance, research on generating and explaining humour remains limited and models underperform compared to humans.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes the need to prioritize computational humour as a distinct NLP subfield and suggests directions to address its subjective and ethical intricacies.

Abstract: The creation and perception of humour is a fundamental human trait,
positioning its computational understanding as one of the most challenging
tasks in natural language processing (NLP). As an abstract, creative, and
frequently context-dependent construct, humour requires extensive reasoning to
understand and create, making it a pertinent task for assessing the
common-sense knowledge and reasoning abilities of modern large language models
(LLMs). In this work, we survey the landscape of computational humour as it
pertains to the generative tasks of creation and explanation. We observe that,
despite the task of understanding humour bearing all the hallmarks of a
foundational NLP task, work on generating and explaining humour beyond puns
remains sparse, while state-of-the-art models continue to fall short of human
capabilities. We bookend our literature survey by motivating the importance of
computational humour processing as a subdiscipline of NLP and presenting an
extensive discussion of future directions for research in the area that takes
into account the subjective and ethically ambiguous nature of humour.

*Jieli Zhu,Vi Ngoc-Nha Tran*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores personally identifiable information (PII) leakage in small language model (SLM)-based chatbots and proposes a new attack method, GEP, which outperforms previous approaches in leakage detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SLMs are appealing due to energy and time efficiency but have not been thoroughly analyzed for PII leakage, especially in sensitive fields like medicine.

Method: The authors fine-tuned a chatbot (ChatBioGPT) using a medical dataset, evaluated its performance, and introduced GEP, a gradient-based method, to detect PII leakage effectively in realistic scenarios.

Result: The GEP method demonstrated up to 60x more PII leakage detection than template-based approaches and managed to detect leakage rates up to 4.53% even in complex conditions.

Conclusion: SLMs, while efficient, pose significant PII leakage risks, necessitating advanced evaluation methods like GEP to ensure privacy in sensitive applications.

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) become unprecedentedly appealing due to their
approximately equivalent performance compared to large language models (LLMs)
in certain fields with less energy and time consumption during training and
inference. However, the personally identifiable information (PII) leakage of
SLMs for downstream tasks has yet to be explored. In this study, we investigate
the PII leakage of the chatbot based on SLM. We first finetune a new chatbot,
i.e., ChatBioGPT based on the backbone of BioGPT using medical datasets Alpaca
and HealthCareMagic. It shows a matchable performance in BERTscore compared
with previous studies of ChatDoctor and ChatGPT. Based on this model, we prove
that the previous template-based PII attacking methods cannot effectively
extract the PII in the dataset for leakage detection under the SLM condition.
We then propose GEP, which is a greedy coordinate gradient-based (GCG) method
specifically designed for PII extraction. We conduct experimental studies of
GEP and the results show an increment of up to 60$\times$ more leakage compared
with the previous template-based methods. We further expand the capability of
GEP in the case of a more complicated and realistic situation by conducting
free-style insertion where the inserted PII in the dataset is in the form of
various syntactic expressions instead of fixed templates, and GEP is still able
to reveal a PII leakage rate of up to 4.53%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework to enhance scientific reasoning in large language models by combining implicit retrieval and structured collaboration, significantly improving accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies caused by explicit retrieval processes and the dilution of solutions in multi-agent pipelines during language model-based scientific reasoning.

Method: The framework has two main components: (1) a Monitor-based retrieval module for token-level implicit knowledge integration, and (2) structured collaboration techniques, including Hierarchical Solution Refinement (HSR) and Quality-Aware Iterative Reasoning (QAIR), for refining candidate solutions.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (48.3%) on Humanity's Last Exam Bio/Chem, significantly outperforming prior models by up to 18.1 points, reducing token usage by 53.5%, and cutting agent steps by 43.7%. Robustness is confirmed across other domains like SuperGPQA and TRQA.

Conclusion: Implicit augmentation and structured refinement successfully address tool inefficiencies and aggregation problems in language models, enhancing both accuracy and resource efficiency.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong progress on
scientific reasoning, yet two major bottlenecks remain. First, explicit
retrieval fragments reasoning, imposing a hidden "tool tax" of extra tokens and
steps. Second, multi-agent pipelines often dilute strong solutions by averaging
across all candidates. We address these challenges with a unified framework
that combines implicit retrieval and structured collaboration. At its
foundation, a Monitor-based retrieval module operates at the token level,
integrating external knowledge with minimal disruption to reasoning. On top of
this substrate, Hierarchical Solution Refinement (HSR) iteratively designates
each candidate as an anchor to be repaired by its peers, while Quality-Aware
Iterative Reasoning (QAIR) adapts refinement to solution quality. On Humanity's
Last Exam (HLE) Bio/Chem Gold, our framework achieves 48.3\% accuracy -- the
highest reported to date, surpassing the strongest agent baseline by 13.4
points and leading frontier LLMs by up to 18.1 points, while simultaneously
reducing token usage by 53.5\% and agent steps by 43.7\%. Results on SuperGPQA
and TRQA confirm robustness across domains. Error analysis shows that reasoning
failures and knowledge gaps co-occur in over 85\% of cases, while diversity
analysis reveals a clear dichotomy: retrieval tasks benefit from solution
variety, whereas reasoning tasks favor consensus. Together, these findings
demonstrate how implicit augmentation and structured refinement overcome the
inefficiencies of explicit tool use and uniform aggregation. Code is available

### [93] [CLaw: Benchmarking Chinese Legal Knowledge in Large Language Models - A Fine-grained Corpus and Reasoning Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21208)
*Xinzhe Xu,Liang Zhao,Hongshen Xu,Chen Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CLaw, a benchmark designed to evaluate Chinese legal reasoning in LLMs, revealing their struggles in faithfully reproducing legal provisions and suggesting strategies to improve reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited reliability of general pre-trained LLMs in analyzing legal texts, particularly for accurately retrieving and reasoning with Chinese legal statutes.

Method: The paper develops CLaw, comprising (1) a detailed corpus of Chinese statutes segmented at the subparagraph level with historical revisions and (2) challenging case-based reasoning tests from Supreme Court materials.

Result: Most existing LLMs fail to reliably recall and cite legal provisions, undermining their legal reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: Trustworthy legal reasoning in LLMs requires combining accurate knowledge retrieval methods, such as supervised fine-tuning or retrieval-augmented generation, with strong reasoning skills. CLaw serves as a crucial tool to evaluate and improve these systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with analyzing legal
texts and citing relevant statutes, yet their reliability is often compromised
by general pre-training that ingests legal texts without specialized focus,
obscuring the true depth of their legal knowledge. This paper introduces CLaw,
a novel benchmark specifically engineered to meticulously evaluate LLMs on
Chinese legal knowledge and its application in reasoning. CLaw comprises two
key components: (1) a comprehensive, fine-grained corpus of all 306 Chinese
national statutes, segmented to the subparagraph level and incorporating
precise historical revision timesteps for rigorous recall evaluation (64,849
entries), and (2) a challenging set of 254 case-based reasoning instances
derived from China Supreme Court curated materials to assess the practical
application of legal knowledge. Our empirical evaluation reveals that most
contemporary LLMs significantly struggle to faithfully reproduce legal
provisions. As accurate retrieval and citation of legal provisions form the
basis of legal reasoning, this deficiency critically undermines the reliability
of their responses. We contend that achieving trustworthy legal reasoning in
LLMs requires a robust synergy of accurate knowledge retrieval--potentially
enhanced through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG)--and strong general reasoning capabilities. This work provides an
essential benchmark and critical insights for advancing domain-specific LLM
reasoning, particularly within the complex legal sphere.

*Yaxiong Wu,Yongyue Zhang,Sheng Liang,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SGMem is a memory management system for long-term conversational agents that uses sentence-level graphs to improve context retrieval and response generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of conversational agents necessitates effective memory systems to manage dialogue histories beyond the context window of large language models (LLMs). Existing methods struggle to efficiently organize and retrieve relevant information.

Method: SGMem uses sentence-level graphs to represent dialogue within chunked units, capturing associations at multiple contextual levels (turn, round, session). It combines raw dialogue with generated memory like summaries, facts, and insights.

Result: SGMem demonstrated superior performance in experiments on LongMemEval and LoCoMo datasets, achieving higher accuracy and outperforming strong baselines in long-term conversational question answering tasks.

Conclusion: The SGMem approach provides LLMs with coherent and relevant contextual memory, enhancing long-term conversational capability.

Abstract: Long-term conversational agents require effective memory management to handle
dialogue histories that exceed the context window of large language models
(LLMs). Existing methods based on fact extraction or summarization reduce
redundancy but struggle to organize and retrieve relevant information across
different granularities of dialogue and generated memory. We introduce SGMem
(Sentence Graph Memory), which represents dialogue as sentence-level graphs
within chunked units, capturing associations across turn-, round-, and
session-level contexts. By combining retrieved raw dialogue with generated
memory such as summaries, facts and insights, SGMem supplies LLMs with coherent
and relevant context for response generation. Experiments on LongMemEval and
LoCoMo show that SGMem consistently improves accuracy and outperforms strong
baselines in long-term conversational question answering.

*Yaxiong Wu,Jianyuan Bo,Yongyue Zhang,Sheng Liang,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: QCG-RAG introduces a query-centric graph structure for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to address the granularity issue in balancing token costs and context relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges of balancing granularity in retrieval-augmented generation methods, where overly fine-grained graphs lose context and coarse graphs fail to accurately capture relationships.

Method: The paper proposes a query-centric graph-building framework using Doc2Query tools to generate query-specific graphs and a custom graph-based multi-hop retrieval process to identify relevant text chunks.

Result: Experiments on datasets LiHuaWorld and MultiHop-RAG demonstrate that QCG-RAG improves question-answering accuracy over existing chunk- and graph-based RAG methods.

Conclusion: QCG-RAG offers an effective and interpretable approach to addressing granularity issues in RAG frameworks, setting a benchmark in multi-hop reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enriches large language
models (LLMs) with external knowledge for long-context understanding and
multi-hop reasoning, but existing methods face a granularity dilemma:
fine-grained entity-level graphs incur high token costs and lose context, while
coarse document-level graphs fail to capture nuanced relations. We introduce
QCG-RAG, a query-centric graph RAG framework that enables query-granular
indexing and multi-hop chunk retrieval. Our query-centric approach leverages
Doc2Query and Doc2Query{-}{-} to construct query-centric graphs with
controllable granularity, improving graph quality and interpretability. A
tailored multi-hop retrieval mechanism then selects relevant chunks via the
generated queries. Experiments on LiHuaWorld and MultiHop-RAG show that QCG-RAG
consistently outperforms prior chunk-based and graph-based RAG methods in
question answering accuracy, establishing a new paradigm for multi-hop
reasoning.

*Evgeny Kaskov,Elizaveta Petrova,Petr Surovtsev,Anna Kostikova,Ilya Mistiurin,Alexander Kapitanov,Alexander Nagaev*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the problem of homonym duplication in generative diffusion models, with a focus on both linguistic and cultural biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the challenges caused by homonyms in text, which lead generative models to erroneously blend multiple interpretations into a single output. Furthermore, it aims to address Anglocentric translations causing non-English words to acquire homonym characteristics in English, leading to inaccuracies.

Method: The paper measures duplication rates using Vision-Language Models (VLM) and human evaluation. It also proposes prompt expansion as a strategy to address the issue.

Result: The proposed prompt expansion method successfully reduces homonym duplication and addresses issues arising from Anglocentric bias.

Conclusion: Prompt expansion is shown to be an effective technique for mitigating homonym duplication in generative diffusion models, and the paper's evaluation pipeline is made publicly accessible.

Abstract: Homonyms are words with identical spelling but distinct meanings, which pose
challenges for many generative models. When a homonym appears in a prompt,
diffusion models may generate multiple senses of the word simultaneously, which
is known as homonym duplication. This issue is further complicated by an
Anglocentric bias, which includes an additional translation step before the
text-to-image model pipeline. As a result, even words that are not homonymous
in the original language may become homonyms and lose their meaning after
translation into English. In this paper, we introduce a method for measuring
duplication rates and conduct evaluations of different diffusion models using
both automatic evaluation utilizing Vision-Language Models (VLM) and human
evaluation. Additionally, we investigate methods to mitigate the homonym
duplication problem through prompt expansion, demonstrating that this approach
also effectively reduces duplication related to Anglocentric bias. The code for
the automatic evaluation pipeline is publicly available.

*Shomik Jain,Jack Lanchantin,Maximilian Nickel,Karen Ullrich,Ashia Wilson,Jamelle Watson-Daniels*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses output homogenization in large language models, proposing a task-dependent approach to enhance diversity where needed while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of task-specific considerations in evaluating and mitigating output homogenization in large language models, recognizing that homogenization expectations vary across task types.

Method: The authors develop a task taxonomy with eight categories, propose task-anchored functional diversity for evaluations, and introduce a task-anchored sampling technique to adjust homogenization based on task-specific requirements.

Result: The proposed techniques increased functional diversity for tasks where it was desired while preserving output quality, demonstrating the success of a task-dependent approach in addressing homogenization issues.

Conclusion: Task dependence is critical for effectively evaluating and mitigating output homogenization in large language models without compromising response quality.

Abstract: A large language model can be less helpful if it exhibits output response
homogenization. But whether two responses are considered homogeneous, and
whether such homogenization is problematic, both depend on the task category.
For instance, in objective math tasks, we often expect no variation in the
final answer but anticipate variation in the problem-solving strategy. Whereas,
for creative writing tasks, we may expect variation in key narrative components
(e.g. plot, genre, setting, etc), beyond the vocabulary or embedding diversity
produced by temperature-sampling. Previous work addressing output
homogenization often fails to conceptualize diversity in a task-dependent way.
We address this gap in the literature directly by making the following
contributions. (1) We present a task taxonomy comprised of eight task
categories that each have distinct conceptualizations of output homogenization.
(2) We introduce task-anchored functional diversity to better evaluate output
homogenization. (3) We propose a task-anchored sampling technique that
increases functional diversity for task categories where homogenization is
undesired, while preserving homogenization where it is desired. (4) We
challenge the perceived existence of a diversity-quality trade-off by
increasing functional diversity while maintaining response quality. Overall, we
demonstrate how task dependence improves the evaluation and mitigation of
output homogenization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LLMTrace, a bilingual corpus for detecting AI-generated text, addressing gaps in existing datasets like limited languages and mixed authorship scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome limitations in training data for detecting AI-generated text, such as outdated datasets, English focus, and lack of annotations for mixed human-AI authorship.

Method: The authors developed LLMTrace, a bilingual corpus (English and Russian) with character-level annotations, capable of supporting binary classification and interval detection tasks.

Result: LLMTrace provides a modern and practical dataset with a diverse range of text inputs, enabling better training for next-gen models in AI text detection.

Conclusion: LLMTrace serves as a crucial resource to address existing challenges in AI text detection, setting the groundwork for improved and nuanced detection systems.

Abstract: The widespread use of human-like text from Large Language Models (LLMs)
necessitates the development of robust detection systems. However, progress is
limited by a critical lack of suitable training data; existing datasets are
often generated with outdated models, are predominantly in English, and fail to
address the increasingly common scenario of mixed human-AI authorship.
Crucially, while some datasets address mixed authorship, none provide the
character-level annotations required for the precise localization of
AI-generated segments within a text. To address these gaps, we introduce
LLMTrace, a new large-scale, bilingual (English and Russian) corpus for
AI-generated text detection. Constructed using a diverse range of modern
proprietary and open-source LLMs, our dataset is designed to support two key
tasks: traditional full-text binary classification (human vs. AI) and the novel
task of AI-generated interval detection, facilitated by character-level
annotations. We believe LLMTrace will serve as a vital resource for training
and evaluating the next generation of more nuanced and practical AI detection
models. The project page is available at

TL;DR: This paper provides a theoretical analysis on how input perturbations impact Chain-of-Thought (CoT) outputs, supporting findings with experimental validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and mitigating the impact of input perturbations on Chain-of-Thought reasoning outputs remains an open challenge, which limits advancements in prompt optimization methods.

Method: Derived an upper bound for input perturbations, drew theoretical conclusions about their relation to reasoning steps, and validated these findings on the Linear Self-Attention (LSA) model supplemented by experiments.

Result: Proved that input perturbation effects are positively correlated with reasoning steps, cannot be eliminated with infinitely long reasoning, and depend on norms of input embedding and hidden state vectors. Experimental results validated theoretical predictions.

Conclusion: The paper provides new insights into the propagation of input perturbations in CoT reasoning, establishing theoretical foundations to guide future work in prompt optimization and model robustness.

Abstract: Existing research indicates that the output of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) is
significantly affected by input perturbations. Although many methods aim to
mitigate such impact by optimizing prompts, a theoretical explanation of how
these perturbations influence CoT outputs remains an open area of research.
This gap limits our in-depth understanding of how input perturbations propagate
during the reasoning process and hinders further improvements in prompt
optimization methods. Therefore, in this paper, we theoretically analyze the
effect of input perturbations on the fluctuation of CoT outputs. We first
derive an upper bound for input perturbations under the condition that the
output fluctuation is within an acceptable range, based on which we prove that:
(i) This upper bound is positively correlated with the number of reasoning
steps in the CoT; (ii) Even an infinitely long reasoning process cannot
eliminate the impact of input perturbations. We then apply these conclusions to
the Linear Self-Attention (LSA) model, which can be viewed as a simplified
version of the Transformer. For the LSA model, we prove that the upper bound
for input perturbation is negatively correlated with the norms of the input
embedding and hidden state vectors. To validate this theoretical analysis, we
conduct experiments on three mainstream datasets and four mainstream models.
The experimental results align with our theoretical analysis, empirically
demonstrating the correctness of our findings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DisCoCLIP is a multimodal model that improves compositional reasoning in vision-language tasks by integrating syntactic structure into text encoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models often fail in tasks requiring understanding of word order and grammatical structure.

Method: DisCoCLIP combines a frozen CLIP vision transformer with a tensor network text encoder capable of encoding syntactic language structure. It uses Combinatory Categorial Grammar parsing and reduces parameter count through tensor decompositions.

Result: DisCoCLIP significantly enhances sensitivity to verb semantics, word order, and improves performance on multiple benchmarks, including SVO-Probes, ARO scores, and a new SVO-Swap benchmark.

Conclusion: Embedding explicit linguistic structure via tensor networks leads to interpretable, efficient models improving compositional reasoning in vision-language tasks.

Abstract: Recent vision-language models excel at large-scale image-text alignment but
often neglect the compositional structure of language, leading to failures on
tasks that hinge on word order and predicate-argument structure. We introduce
DisCoCLIP, a multimodal encoder that combines a frozen CLIP vision transformer
with a novel tensor network text encoder that explicitly encodes syntactic
structure. Sentences are parsed with a Combinatory Categorial Grammar parser to
yield distributional word tensors whose contractions mirror the sentence's
grammatical derivation. To keep the model efficient, high-order tensors are
factorized with tensor decompositions, reducing parameter count from tens of
millions to under one million. Trained end-to-end with a self-supervised
contrastive loss, DisCoCLIP markedly improves sensitivity to verb semantics and
word order: it raises CLIP's SVO-Probes verb accuracy from 77.6% to 82.4%,
boosts ARO attribution and relation scores by over 9% and 4%, and achieves
93.7% on a newly introduced SVO-Swap benchmark. These results demonstrate that
embedding explicit linguistic structure via tensor networks yields
interpretable, parameter-efficient representations that substantially improve
compositional reasoning in vision-language tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Updesh, a synthetic dataset for Indian languages generated through a bottom-up strategy using large language models, demonstrating improved AI capabilities, particularly in low-resource languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing effective and culturally grounded multilingual AI systems, especially for low-resource languages, is challenging and understudied.

Method: Synthetic datasets were generated by prompting large open-source LLMs using language-specific Wikipedia content, emphasizing Indian cultural contexts.

Result: Updesh dataset improved AI models' performance significantly in generative tasks and narrowed gaps between low/medium-resource and high-resource languages.

Conclusion: Multilingual AI development benefits from culturally grounded, context-aware data pipelines that depart from traditional top-down methods.

Abstract: Developing AI systems that operate effectively across languages while
remaining culturally grounded is a long-standing challenge, particularly in
low-resource settings. Synthetic data provides a promising avenue, yet its
effectiveness in multilingual and multicultural contexts remains underexplored.
We investigate the creation and impact of synthetic, culturally contextualized
datasets for Indian languages through a bottom-up generation strategy that
prompts large open-source LLMs (>= 235B parameters) to ground data generation
in language-specific Wikipedia content. This approach complements the dominant
top-down paradigm of translating synthetic datasets from high-resource
languages such as English. We introduce Updesh, a high-quality large-scale
synthetic instruction-following dataset comprising 9.5M data points across 13
Indian languages, encompassing diverse reasoning and generative tasks with an
emphasis on long-context, multi-turn capabilities, and alignment with Indian
cultural contexts. A comprehensive evaluation incorporating both automated
metrics and human annotation across 10k assessments indicates that generated
data is high quality; though, human evaluation highlights areas for further
improvement. Additionally, we perform downstream evaluations by fine-tuning
models on our dataset and assessing the performance across 15 diverse
multilingual datasets. Models trained on Updesh consistently achieve
significant gains on generative tasks and remain competitive on multiple-choice
style NLU tasks. Notably, relative improvements are most pronounced in low and
medium-resource languages, narrowing their gap with high-resource languages.
These findings provide empirical evidence that effective multilingual AI
requires multi-faceted data curation and generation strategies that incorporate
context-aware, culturally grounded methodologies.

### [102] [Sycophancy Is Not One Thing: Causal Separation of Sycophantic Behaviors in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21305)
*Daniel Vennemeyer,Phan Anh Duong,Tiffany Zhan,Tianyu Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates sycophantic behaviors in large language models (LLMs) and finds that these behaviors originate from distinct, linear, and independently steerable representations in latent space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and mitigating sycophantic behaviors in LLMs is crucial for improving their trustworthiness and reliability, as these behaviors may distort model-user interactions.

Method: The authors used difference-in-means directions, activation additions, and subspace geometry to study sycophantic agreement, sycophantic praise, and genuine agreement across various models and datasets.

Result: The study reveals that sycophantic agreement, sycophantic praise, and genuine agreement are encoded along distinct linear directions in the model's latent space, and these behaviors can be modulated independently. This structure is consistent across different model families and scales.

Conclusion: Sycophantic behaviors in LLMs are driven by separate and steerable mechanisms, offering potential avenues for targeted interventions to address undesirable interactions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit sycophantic behaviors -- such as
excessive agreement with or flattery of the user -- but it is unclear whether
these behaviors arise from a single mechanism or multiple distinct processes.
We decompose sycophancy into sycophantic agreement and sycophantic praise,
contrasting both with genuine agreement. Using difference-in-means directions,
activation additions, and subspace geometry across multiple models and
datasets, we show that: (1) the three behaviors are encoded along distinct
linear directions in latent space; (2) each behavior can be independently
amplified or suppressed without affecting the others; and (3) their
representational structure is consistent across model families and scales.
These results suggest that sycophantic behaviors correspond to distinct,
independently steerable representations.

*Zhilin Wang,Jiaqi Zeng,Olivier Delalleau,Ellie Evans,Daniel Egert,Hoo-Chang Shin,Felipe Soares,Yi Dong,Oleksii Kuchaiev*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces RLBFF, a reinforcement learning framework that combines human feedback and rule-based verification to improve response quality evaluation, surpassing existing models in alignment benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLHF lacks explicit criteria and struggles with interpretability, while RLVR's correctness-based focus limits scope. Hence, RLBFF is proposed to address these limitations.

Method: RLBFF extracts binary principles from human feedback and frames them as entailment tasks for training reward models, allowing customizability during inference.

Result: Reward Models trained with RLBFF achieve top rankings in benchmarks like RM-Bench and JudgeBench. The open-source framework matches leading models on alignment tasks at reduced inference costs.

Conclusion: RLBFF combines flexibility and precision for tailored response evaluations, offering a competitive, open-source solution for LLM post-training in terms of performance and cost efficiency.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) are the main RL paradigms used in LLM
post-training, each offering distinct advantages. However, RLHF struggles with
interpretability and reward hacking because it relies on human judgments that
usually lack explicit criteria, whereas RLVR is limited in scope by its focus
on correctness-based verifiers. We propose Reinforcement Learning with Binary
Flexible Feedback (RLBFF), which combines the versatility of human-driven
preferences with the precision of rule-based verification, enabling reward
models to capture nuanced aspects of response quality beyond mere correctness.
RLBFF extracts principles that can be answered in a binary fashion (e.g.
accuracy of information: yes, or code readability: no) from natural language
feedback. Such principles can then be used to ground Reward Model training as
an entailment task (response satisfies or does not satisfy an arbitrary
principle). We show that Reward Models trained in this manner can outperform
Bradley-Terry models when matched for data and achieve top performance on
RM-Bench (86.2%) and JudgeBench (81.4%, #1 on leaderboard as of September 24,
2025). Additionally, users can specify principles of interest at inference time
to customize the focus of our reward models, in contrast to Bradley-Terry
models. Finally, we present a fully open source recipe (including data) to
align Qwen3-32B using RLBFF and our Reward Model, to match or exceed the
performance of o3-mini and DeepSeek R1 on general alignment benchmarks of
MT-Bench, WildBench, and Arena Hard v2 (at <5% of the inference cost).

Motivation: To create a model capable of aligning natural language with diverse scientific representations and performing complex reasoning tasks across domains.

Method: The model was pretrained on a large scientific corpus, fine-tuned using 40M instructions, bootstrapping for long-form reasoning, and reinforcement learning for task-specific reasoning. Data curation and multi-discipline training were emphasized.

Result: The model supports capabilities like translation between text and scientific formats, knowledge extraction, and data-driven property prediction while improving fidelity and generalization.

Conclusion: Cross-discipline learning enhances reliability, making the model suitable for varied scientific reasoning tasks. It is open-sourced for further use and development.

Abstract: We present a scientific reasoning foundation model that aligns natural
language with heterogeneous scientific representations. The model is pretrained
on a 206B-token corpus spanning scientific text, pure sequences, and
sequence-text pairs, then aligned via SFT on 40M instructions, annealed
cold-start bootstrapping to elicit long-form chain-of-thought, and
reinforcement learning with task-specific reward shaping, which instills
deliberate scientific reasoning. It supports four capability families, covering
up to 103 tasks across workflows: (i) faithful translation between text and
scientific formats, (ii) text/knowledge extraction, (iii) property prediction,
(iv) property classification, (v) unconditional and conditional sequence
generation and design. Compared with specialist systems, our approach broadens
instruction coverage, improves cross-domain generalization, and enhances
fidelity. We detail data curation and training and show that cross-discipline

### [105] [Leveraging NTPs for Efficient Hallucination Detection in VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20379)
*Ofir Azachi,Kfir Eliyahu,Eyal El Ani,Rom Himelstein,Roi Reichart,Yuval Pinter,Nitay Calderon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a lightweight method for detecting hallucinations in vision-language models (VLMs) using next-token probabilities (NTP) to measure model uncertainty, achieving competitive performance without heavy computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of hallucinations in VLMs, which compromise their reliability, by finding an efficient and computationally lightweight detection mechanism.

Method: The paper proposes using next-token probabilities (NTP) as a measure of uncertainty in VLM-generated outputs. A dataset of 1,400 human-annotated statements was used to train traditional ML models on these NTP-based features, with further enhancements by combining these signals with linguistic NTPs and integrating scores from VLMs.

Result: The NTP-based features proved effective in predicting hallucinations. The lightweight models achieved comparable performance to stronger VLMs, and combining NTPs with linguistic NTPs and VLM-based predictions boosted detection accuracy.

Conclusion: NTP-based methods provide an efficient and reliable way to detect hallucinations in VLMs, and combining these with other predictive features further improves their effectiveness, demonstrating the potential for simpler, faster hallucination detection systems.

Abstract: Hallucinations of vision-language models (VLMs), which are misalignments
between visual content and generated text, undermine the reliability of VLMs.
One common approach for detecting them employs the same VLM, or a different
one, to assess generated outputs. This process is computationally intensive and
increases model latency. In this paper, we explore an efficient on-the-fly
method for hallucination detection by training traditional ML models over
signals based on the VLM's next-token probabilities (NTPs). NTPs provide a
direct quantification of model uncertainty. We hypothesize that high
uncertainty (i.e., a low NTP value) is strongly associated with hallucinations.
To test this, we introduce a dataset of 1,400 human-annotated statements
derived from VLM-generated content, each labeled as hallucinated or not, and
use it to test our NTP-based lightweight method. Our results demonstrate that
NTP-based features are valuable predictors of hallucinations, enabling fast and
simple ML models to achieve performance comparable to that of strong VLMs.
Furthermore, augmenting these NTPs with linguistic NTPs, computed by feeding
only the generated text back into the VLM, enhances hallucination detection
performance. Finally, integrating hallucination prediction scores from VLMs
into the NTP-based models led to better performance than using either VLMs or
NTPs alone. We hope this study paves the way for simple, lightweight solutions
that enhance the reliability of VLMs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Fast-SEnSeI, a sensor-independent, lightweight encoder for cloud segmentation across multispectral sensors, suitable for on-board and space hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of tightly sensor-coupled models and reliance on ground-based processing in cloud segmentation.

Method: Developing Fast-SEnSeI, a lightweight encoder with improved spectral descriptors and a robust, hybrid CPU-FPGA implementation for cloud segmentation.

Result: The method proved accurate for cloud segmentation on Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 datasets, regardless of input band configurations.

Conclusion: Fast-SEnSeI enables flexible and efficient cloud segmentation on embedded and space-qualified hardware, advancing on-board Earth observation capabilities.

Abstract: Cloud segmentation is a critical preprocessing step for many Earth
observation tasks, yet most models are tightly coupled to specific sensor
configurations and rely on ground-based processing. In this work, we propose
Fast-SEnSeI, a lightweight, sensor-independent encoder module that enables
flexible, on-board cloud segmentation across multispectral sensors with varying
band configurations. Building upon SEnSeI-v2, Fast-SEnSeI integrates an
improved spectral descriptor, lightweight architecture, and robust padding-band
handling. It accepts arbitrary combinations of spectral bands and their
wavelengths, producing fixed-size feature maps that feed into a compact,
quantized segmentation model based on a modified U-Net. The module runs
efficiently on embedded CPUs using Apache TVM, while the segmentation model is
deployed on FPGA, forming a CPU-FPGA hybrid pipeline suitable for
space-qualified hardware. Evaluations on Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 datasets
demonstrate accurate segmentation across diverse input configurations.

*Elias N. Zois,Moises Diaz,Salem Said,Miguel A. Ferrer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses offline handwritten signature verification using a synthetic data generation method based on Riemannian geometry, achieving strong results across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenge of writer-independent handwritten signature verification by developing models capable of generalization without relying solely on real-world signature datasets.

Method: The paper proposes using Riemannian geometry to generate quasi-synthetic data from genuine samples in the SPD matrix space. It involves a Riemannian Gaussian Mixture to simulate synthetic writers and variances, coupled with a metric learning framework for verification.

Result: Experiments show that the quasi-synthetic approach produces low error rates on signature datasets covering different writing styles, demonstrating its effectiveness under multiple evaluation protocols.

Conclusion: Using synthetic data generated in Riemannian spaces can enhance writer-independent signature verification, suggesting potential for broader applications in this domain.

Abstract: Offline handwritten signature verification remains a challenging task,
particularly in writer-independent settings where models must generalize across
unseen individuals. Recent developments have highlighted the advantage of
geometrically inspired representations, such as covariance descriptors on
Riemannian manifolds. However, past or present, handcrafted or data-driven
methods usually depend on real-world signature datasets for classifier
training. We introduce a quasi-synthetic data generation framework leveraging
the Riemannian geometry of Symmetric Positive Definite matrices (SPD). A small
set of genuine samples in the SPD space is the seed to a Riemannian Gaussian
Mixture which identifies Riemannian centers as synthetic writers and variances
as their properties. Riemannian Gaussian sampling on each center generates
positive as well as negative synthetic SPD populations. A metric learning
framework utilizes pairs of similar and dissimilar SPD points, subsequently
testing it over on real-world datasets. Experiments conducted on two popular
signature datasets, encompassing Western and Asian writing styles, demonstrate
the efficacy of the proposed approach under both intra- and cross- dataset
evaluation protocols. The results indicate that our quasi-synthetic approach
achieves low error rates, highlighting the potential of generating synthetic
data in Riemannian spaces for writer-independent signature verification
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To push the boundaries of generative AI by providing a unified system capable of handling sophisticated image synthesis, editing, and composition tasks with high efficiency.

Method: Seedream 4.0 employs a diffusion transformer combined with an optimized VAE, pretrained on billions of text-image pairs, fine-tuned VLM model for multimodal tasks, and multiple inference optimization strategies to achieve high performance.

Result: Seedream 4.0 delivers state-of-the-art results, enabling precise image editing, in-context reasoning, multi-image referencing, and generating high-resolution images efficiently on an interactive framework.

Conclusion: The system establishes a new benchmark in multimodal generative AI, serving as a versatile and advanced tool for creative and professional applications, accessible for broader usage.

Abstract: We introduce Seedream 4.0, an efficient and high-performance multimodal image
generation system that unifies text-to-image (T2I) synthesis, image editing,
and multi-image composition within a single framework. We develop a highly
efficient diffusion transformer with a powerful VAE which also can reduce the
number of image tokens considerably. This allows for efficient training of our
model, and enables it to fast generate native high-resolution images (e.g.,
1K-4K). Seedream 4.0 is pretrained on billions of text-image pairs spanning
diverse taxonomies and knowledge-centric concepts. Comprehensive data
collection across hundreds of vertical scenarios, coupled with optimized
strategies, ensures stable and large-scale training, with strong
generalization. By incorporating a carefully fine-tuned VLM model, we perform
multi-modal post-training for training both T2I and image editing tasks
jointly. For inference acceleration, we integrate adversarial distillation,
distribution matching, and quantization, as well as speculative decoding. It
achieves an inference time of up to 1.8 seconds for generating a 2K image
(without a LLM/VLM as PE model). Comprehensive evaluations reveal that Seedream
4.0 can achieve state-of-the-art results on both T2I and multimodal image
editing. In particular, it demonstrates exceptional multimodal capabilities in
complex tasks, including precise image editing and in-context reasoning, and
also allows for multi-image reference, and can generate multiple output images.
This extends traditional T2I systems into an more interactive and
multidimensional creative tool, pushing the boundary of generative AI for both
creativity and professional applications. Seedream 4.0 is now accessible on

*Samia Saeed,Khuram Naveed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Contrastive Learning (CL)-based approach for early breast cancer detection using deep learning, achieving a 96.7% accuracy on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Breast cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths, and early detection significantly improves treatment outcomes. Traditional CAD systems are limited, while deep learning methods face challenges with small labeled datasets.

Method: The authors used a semi-supervised Contrastive Learning framework with ResNet-50, leveraging large amounts of unlabeled mammogram data and various augmentations, then fine-tuned the model on a small labeled dataset.

Result: The proposed method achieved 96.7% accuracy in breast cancer detection on the benchmark datasets INbreast and MIAS, surpassing existing methods.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of Contrastive Learning in overcoming data limitations and highlights its application in achieving high accuracy in breast cancer detection.

Abstract: Breast cancer, the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally,
accounts for a quarter of all cancer cases [1]. To lower this death rate, it is
crucial to detect tumors early, as early-stage detection significantly improves
treatment outcomes. Advances in non-invasive imaging techniques have made early
detection possible through computer-aided detection (CAD) systems which rely on
traditional image analysis to identify malignancies. However, there is a
growing shift towards deep learning methods due to their superior
effectiveness. Despite their potential, deep learning methods often struggle
with accuracy due to the limited availability of large-labeled datasets for
training. To address this issue, our study introduces a Contrastive Learning
(CL) framework, which excels with smaller labeled datasets. In this regard, we
train Resnet-50 in semi supervised CL approach using similarity index on a
large amount of unlabeled mammogram data. In this regard, we use various
augmentation and transformations which help improve the performance of our
approach. Finally, we tune our model on a small set of labelled data that
outperforms the existing state of the art. Specifically, we observed a 96.7%
accuracy in detecting breast cancer on benchmark datasets INbreast and MIAS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether Foundation Models can replace task-specific supervised AI in quality inspection, thereby reducing the need for labeled training data and improving implementation efficiency.

Method: The authors tested multiple recent Foundation Models on both real-world industrial image data and public image datasets to evaluate their performance.

Result: The models performed well on public benchmark datasets but failed on the real-world industrial data.

Conclusion: Foundation Models are unsuitable in their current form for real-world industrial quality inspection tasks, despite their promise in generalization across datasets.

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) have shown impressive performance on various text and
image processing tasks. They can generalize across domains and datasets in a
zero-shot setting. This could make them suitable for automated quality
inspection during series manufacturing, where various types of images are being
evaluated for many different products. Replacing tedious labeling tasks with a
simple text prompt to describe anomalies and utilizing the same models across
many products would save significant efforts during model setup and
implementation. This is a strong advantage over supervised Artificial
Intelligence (AI) models, which are trained for individual applications and
require labeled training data. We test multiple recent FMs on both custom
real-world industrial image data and public image data. We show that all of
those models fail on our real-world data, while the very same models perform
well on public benchmark datasets.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a universal Neural Space (NS) framework to simplify and improve efficiency in multi-task vision and imaging applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI models are designed for specific high-precision tasks, creating inefficiency when handling modular tasks across different latent domains.

Method: The authors propose a universal Neural Space (NS) using an encoder-decoder architecture to compute features shared across multiple vision and imaging tasks.

Result: The framework reduces redundancies, enhances generalization across domain shifts, and efficiently performs tasks like demosaicing, denoising, depth estimation, and semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: The NS framework establishes an efficient and lightweight foundation for multi-task vision pipelines, distinguishing itself from heavier transformer-based architectures.

Abstract: The majority of AI models in imaging and vision are customized to perform on
specific high-precision task. However, this strategy is inefficient for
applications with a series of modular tasks, since each requires a mapping into
a disparate latent domain. To address this inefficiency, we proposed a
universal Neural Space (NS), where an encoder-decoder framework pre-computes
features across vision and imaging tasks. Our encoder learns transformation
aware, generalizable representations, which enable multiple downstream AI
modules to share the same feature space. This architecture reduces redundancy,
improves generalization across domain shift, and establishes a foundation for
effecient multi-task vision pipelines. Furthermore, as opposed to larger
transformer backbones, our backbone is lightweight and CNN-based, allowing for
wider across hardware. We furthur demonstrate that imaging and vision modules,
such as demosaicing, denoising, depth estimation and semantic segmentation can
be performed efficiently in the NS.

TL;DR: The paper investigates image selection strategies for edge devices in ever-evolving environments to maximize model quality while minimizing transmission costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge devices face computational limits and require efficient updates to operate in dynamic environments, which necessitates optimal image selection for training models efficiently.

Method: The study evaluates the efficacy of combining a high-confidence stream-based strategy with a diversity-based approach to select training images.

Result: A combination of high-confidence and diversity-based strategies yields high-quality models with minimal queries compared to other methods for the same training load.

Conclusion: Strategic image selection significantly improves edge model training efficiency, addressing constraints of computational power and transmission costs in dynamic settings.

Abstract: Edge camera-based systems are continuously expanding, facing ever-evolving
environments that require regular model updates. In practice, complex teacher
models are run on a central server to annotate data, which is then used to
train smaller models tailored to the edge devices with limited computational
power. This work explores how to select the most useful images for training to
maximize model quality while keeping transmission costs low. Our work shows
that, for a similar training load (i.e., iterations), a high-confidence
stream-based strategy coupled with a diversity-based approach produces a
high-quality model with minimal dataset queries.

TL;DR: InstructVTON is a virtual try-on system using Vision Language Models for styling control based on natural language instructions, eliminating the need for manually drawn masks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current virtual try-on systems are challenged by the complexity of generating masks that precisely define styling, which requires expertise and limits flexibility in design.

Method: The method integrates Vision Language Models (VLMs) and image segmentation models to generate binary masks guided by free-text instructions, allowing automated mask creation and styling adjustments.

Result: InstructVTON achieves advanced and precise styling control across a variety of garments and styling scenarios, interoperating with current models for enhanced virtual try-on outcomes.

Conclusion: This system improves end-user experience by eliminating the need for intricate masking while achieving state-of-the-art results in virtual try-on, demonstrating its scalability and automation.

Abstract: We present InstructVTON, an instruction-following interactive virtual try-on
system that allows fine-grained and complex styling control of the resulting
generation, guided by natural language, on single or multiple garments. A
computationally efficient and scalable formulation of virtual try-on formulates
the problem as an image-guided or image-conditioned inpainting task. These
inpainting-based virtual try-on models commonly use a binary mask to control
the generation layout. Producing a mask that yields desirable result is
difficult, requires background knowledge, might be model dependent, and in some
cases impossible with the masking-based approach (e.g. trying on a long-sleeve
shirt with "sleeves rolled up" styling on a person wearing long-sleeve shirt
with sleeves down, where the mask will necessarily cover the entire sleeve).
InstructVTON leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) and image segmentation
models for automated binary mask generation. These masks are generated based on
user-provided images and free-text style instructions. InstructVTON simplifies
the end-user experience by removing the necessity of a precisely drawn mask,
and by automating execution of multiple rounds of image generation for try-on
scenarios that cannot be achieved with masking-based virtual try-on models
alone. We show that InstructVTON is interoperable with existing virtual try-on
models to achieve state-of-the-art results with styling control.

TL;DR: This paper introduces DeepAFRNet, a deep learning model for robust altered fingerprint recognition in challenging conditions (Easy, Medium, Hard), achieving high accuracies using real altered samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Altered fingerprints can be deliberately modified by adversaries to avoid biometric identification, which creates challenges for security applications like border control, forensics, and fiscal admission.

Method: The paper proposes DeepAFRNet, a model using a VGG16 backbone to extract high-dimensional features and cosine similarity for comparing embeddings. It evaluates performance on the SOCOFing Real-Altered dataset under various difficulty levels.

Result: DeepAFRNet achieves accuracies of 96.7%, 98.76%, and 99.54% for Easy, Medium, and Hard levels, respectively. However, relaxing the threshold drastically reduces accuracy, emphasizing the significance of threshold selection.

Conclusion: DeepAFRNet offers improved recognition of altered fingerprints with real-world applicability by addressing shortcomings in prior works, particularly those relying on synthetic data or limited protocols.

Abstract: Altered fingerprint recognition (AFR) is challenging for biometric
verification in applications such as border control, forensics, and fiscal
admission. Adversaries can deliberately modify ridge patterns to evade
detection, so robust recognition of altered prints is essential. We present
DeepAFRNet, a deep learning recognition model that matches and recognizes
distorted fingerprint samples. The approach uses a VGG16 backbone to extract
high-dimensional features and cosine similarity to compare embeddings. We
evaluate on the SOCOFing Real-Altered subset with three difficulty levels
(Easy, Medium, Hard). With strict thresholds, DeepAFRNet achieves accuracies of
96.7 percent, 98.76 percent, and 99.54 percent for the three levels. A
threshold-sensitivity study shows that relaxing the threshold from 0.92 to 0.72
sharply degrades accuracy to 7.86 percent, 27.05 percent, and 29.51 percent,
underscoring the importance of threshold selection in biometric systems. By
using real altered samples and reporting per-level metrics, DeepAFRNet
addresses limitations of prior work based on synthetic alterations or limited
verification protocols, and indicates readiness for real-world deployments
where both security and recognition resilience are critical.

*Hanna Yurchyk,Wei-Di Chang,Gregory Dudek,David Meger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes integrating attention maps from a pre-trained Vision Transformer (DINOv2) into 3D voxel representations for bimanual robotic manipulation tasks, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing the precision and effectiveness of bimanual robotic manipulation by incorporating semantically rich visual information derived from attention maps.

Method: The authors used attention maps from the self-supervised ViT model DINOv2 to provide pixel-level saliency scores. These are then lifted into 3D voxel grids and fed into a voxel-based behavior cloning policy for robotic manipulation.

Result: The integration of attention-guided featurization improved performance by 8.2% in absolute terms and 21.9% in relative terms across tasks in the RLBench bimanual manipulation benchmark.

Conclusion: Leveraging semantic cues from Vision Transformer attention maps leads to substantial performance enhancements in robotic manipulation policies.

Abstract: We investigate the integration of attention maps from a pre-trained Vision
Transformer into voxel representations to enhance bimanual robotic
manipulation. Specifically, we extract attention maps from DINOv2, a
self-supervised ViT model, and interpret them as pixel-level saliency scores
over RGB images. These maps are lifted into a 3D voxel grid, resulting in
voxel-level semantic cues that are incorporated into a behavior cloning policy.
When integrated into a state-of-the-art voxel-based policy, our
attention-guided featurization yields an average absolute improvement of 8.2%
and a relative gain of 21.9% across all tasks in the RLBench bimanual
benchmark.

### [116] [A Comparative Benchmark of Real-time Detectors for Blueberry Detection towards Precision Orchard Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20580)
*Xinyang Mu,Yuzhen Lu,Boyang Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper benchmarks real-time object detectors YOLO and RT-DETR for detecting ripe and unripe blueberries in challenging natural environments. A new dataset and semi-supervised learning (SSL) improve detection, with RT-DETR-v2-X achieving the best accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Blueberry detection in natural environments is challenging due to lighting, occlusions, and motion blur. Deep learning object detectors require diverse datasets and practical trade-offs to optimize performance in real-world applications.

Method: The study benchmarks 36 YOLO and RT-DETR model variants on a newly curated dataset of 661 images with 85,879 labeled blueberries. SSL using 1,035 unlabeled images was applied to further enhance detection accuracy.

Result: YOLOv12m achieved 93.3% mAP@50, RT-DETRv2-X achieved 93.6% mAP@50. SSL improved accuracies up to 94.8% for RT-DETRv2-X, with notable performance gains across models.

Conclusion: RT-DETRv2-X was identified as the top model for blueberry detection, with SSL further enhancing accuracy. Data, tools, and insights from this study provide resources for advancing the field.

Abstract: Blueberry detection in natural environments remains challenging due to
variable lighting, occlusions, and motion blur due to environmental factors and
imaging devices. Deep learning-based object detectors promise to address these
challenges, but they demand a large-scale, diverse dataset that captures the
real-world complexities. Moreover, deploying these models in practical
scenarios often requires the right accuracy/speed/memory trade-off in model
selection. This study presents a novel comparative benchmark analysis of
advanced real-time object detectors, including YOLO (You Only Look Once)
(v8-v12) and RT-DETR (Real-Time Detection Transformers) (v1-v2) families,
consisting of 36 model variants, evaluated on a newly curated dataset for
blueberry detection. This dataset comprises 661 canopy images collected with
smartphones during the 2022-2023 seasons, consisting of 85,879 labelled
instances (including 36,256 ripe and 49,623 unripe blueberries) across a wide
range of lighting conditions, occlusions, and fruit maturity stages. Among the
YOLO models, YOLOv12m achieved the best accuracy with a mAP@50 of 93.3%, while
RT-DETRv2-X obtained a mAP@50 of 93.6%, the highest among all the RT-DETR
variants. The inference time varied with the model scale and complexity, and
the mid-sized models appeared to offer a good accuracy-speed balance. To
further enhance detection performance, all the models were fine-tuned using
Unbiased Mean Teacher-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) on a separate set of
1,035 unlabeled images acquired by a ground-based machine vision platform in
2024. This resulted in accuracy gains ranging from -1.4% to 2.9%, with
RT-DETR-v2-X achieving the best mAP@50 of 94.8%. More in-depth research into
SSL is needed to better leverage cross-domain unlabeled data. Both the dataset
and software programs of this study are made publicly available to support
further research.

### [117] [Region-of-Interest Augmentation for Mammography Classification under Patient-Level Cross-Validation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20585)
*Farbod Bigdeli,Mohsen Mohammadagha,Ali Bigdeli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Researchers evaluated an ROI augmentation strategy to improve mammogram classification using the Mini-DDSM dataset, achieving modest ROC-AUC gains while keeping inference-time costs consistent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving mammogram interpretation using deep learning faces challenges due to limited-resolution datasets and small sample sizes.

Method: They implemented a training-time-only ROI augmentation strategy that replaces full images probabilistically with random ROI crops from a precomputed bounding-box bank.

Result: The augmentation strategy provided modest gains in ROC-AUC across folds but resulted in flat or slightly lower PR-AUC metrics.

Conclusion: ROI augmentation enhances classification performance in constrained settings without requiring new labels or architectural changes.

Abstract: Breast cancer screening with mammography remains central to early detection
and mortality reduction. Deep learning has shown strong potential for
automating mammogram interpretation, yet limited-resolution datasets and small
sample sizes continue to restrict performance. We revisit the Mini-DDSM dataset
(9,684 images; 2,414 patients) and introduce a lightweight region-of-interest
(ROI) augmentation strategy. During training, full images are probabilistically
replaced with random ROI crops sampled from a precomputed, label-free
bounding-box bank, with optional jitter to increase variability. We evaluate
under strict patient-level cross-validation and report ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, and
training-time efficiency metrics (throughput and GPU memory). Because ROI
augmentation is training-only, inference-time cost remains unchanged. On
Mini-DDSM, ROI augmentation (best: p_roi = 0.10, alpha = 0.10) yields modest
average ROC-AUC gains, with performance varying across folds; PR-AUC is flat to
slightly lower. These results demonstrate that simple, data-centric ROI
strategies can enhance mammography classification in constrained settings
without requiring additional labels or architectural modifications.

*Jing Wu,Zirui Wang,Iro Laina,Victor Adrian Prisacariu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to use mirror reflections in images for robust 3D reconstruction, leveraging stereo information from a single capture and camera pose refinements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify and improve the accuracy of 3D reconstruction by exploiting reflection-based stereo information from a single image.

Method: Treat the reflection as a virtual camera view, applying a transformation for pixel-domain generation of virtual views and introducing a symmetric-aware loss for pose refinement. Extendable to dynamic scenes.

Result: Developed a synthetic dataset for evaluation and conducted extensive real-world and synthetic experiments, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: Mirror reflections provide an effective auxiliary view for 3D reconstruction, allowing multi-view setups from single images and precise geometry recovery in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Mirror reflections are common in everyday environments and can provide stereo
information within a single capture, as the real and reflected virtual views
are visible simultaneously. We exploit this property by treating the reflection
as an auxiliary view and designing a transformation that constructs a
physically valid virtual camera, allowing direct pixel-domain generation of the
virtual view while adhering to the real-world imaging process. This enables a
multi-view stereo setup from a single image, simplifying the imaging process,
making it compatible with powerful feed-forward reconstruction models for
generalizable and robust 3D reconstruction. To further exploit the geometric
symmetry introduced by mirrors, we propose a symmetric-aware loss to refine
pose estimation. Our framework also naturally extends to dynamic scenes, where
each frame contains a mirror reflection, enabling efficient per-frame geometry
recovery. For quantitative evaluation, we provide a fully customizable
synthetic dataset of 16 Blender scenes, each with ground-truth point clouds and
camera poses. Extensive experiments on real-world data and synthetic data are
conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of our method.

*Yiming Xiao,Archit Gupta,Miguel Esparza,Yu-Hsuan Ho,Antonia Sebastian,Hannah Weas,Rose Houck,Ali Mostafavi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces FacadeTrack, a system for assessing building occupancy after disasters using street-level imagery and language-guided analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address shortcomings in rapid post-disaster occupancy assessments due to limitations of overhead and street-level imagery.

Method: FacadeTrack processes panoramic video to align imagery with building parcels, rectifies facades, and extracts attributes for decision-making using both one-stage and two-stage strategies.

Result: In post-Hurricane surveys, the two-stage approach demonstrated improved metrics compared to the one-stage, achieving a higher F-1 score (0.848 vs. 0.822).

Conclusion: FacadeTrack provides accurate and scalable assessments, enhances diagnostics, and integrates well into disaster management workflows.

Abstract: Building-level occupancy after disasters is vital for triage, inspections,
utility re-energization, and equitable resource allocation. Overhead imagery
provides rapid coverage but often misses facade and access cues that determine
habitability, while street-view imagery captures those details but is sparse
and difficult to align with parcels. We present FacadeTrack, a street-level,
language-guided framework that links panoramic video to parcels, rectifies
views to facades, and elicits interpretable attributes (for example, entry
blockage, temporary coverings, localized debris) that drive two decision
strategies: a transparent one-stage rule and a two-stage design that separates
perception from conservative reasoning. Evaluated across two post-Hurricane
Helene surveys, the two-stage approach achieves a precision of 0.927, a recall
of 0.781, and an F-1 score of 0.848, compared with the one-stage baseline at a
precision of 0.943, a recall of 0.728, and an F-1 score of 0.822. Beyond
accuracy, intermediate attributes and spatial diagnostics reveal where and why
residual errors occur, enabling targeted quality control. The pipeline provides
auditable, scalable occupancy assessments suitable for integration into
geospatial and emergency-management workflows.

### [120] [Human Semantic Representations of Social Interactions from Moving Shapes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20673)
*Yiling Yun,Hongjing Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates how humans use semantic representations, along with visual features, to interpret social interactions from moving shapes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how humans complement visual features with semantic representations to recognize social interactions in simple displays.

Method: The researchers conducted two studies: 1) asking participants to label animations based on their impressions and analyzing response distributions; and 2) comparing human similarity judgments of social interactions with model predictions derived from visual features, labels, and semantic embeddings extracted from descriptions.

Result: Semantic models, particularly verb-based embeddings from descriptions, provided complementary insights to visual features and aligned best with human similarity judgments.

Conclusion: Humans perceive social interactions as a combination of visual and semantic structures, suggesting that semantic representations bridge visual and abstract understanding in social perception.

Abstract: Humans are social creatures who readily recognize various social interactions
from simple display of moving shapes. While previous research has often focused
on visual features, we examine what semantic representations that humans employ
to complement visual features. In Study 1, we directly asked human participants
to label the animations based on their impression of moving shapes. We found
that human responses were distributed. In Study 2, we measured the
representational geometry of 27 social interactions through human similarity
judgments and compared it with model predictions based on visual features,
labels, and semantic embeddings from animation descriptions. We found that
semantic models provided complementary information to visual features in
explaining human judgments. Among the semantic models, verb-based embeddings
extracted from descriptions account for human similarity judgments the best.
These results suggest that social perception in simple displays reflects the
semantic structure of social interactions, bridging visual and abstract
representations.

*Xiaowei Wang,Di Wang,Ke Li,Yifeng Wang,Chengjian Wang,Libin Sun,Zhihong Wu,Yiming Zhang,Quan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper tackles challenges in cross-view geo-localization by introducing a novel framework to enhance cross-domain generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address robustness issues under diverse UAV orientations and establish reliable global and local correspondences in cross-view geo-localization tasks.

Method: Introduce EGS framework with E²-Steerable CNN encoder for stable feature extraction and a graph-based mechanism incorporating a virtual super-node for global-local consistency.

Result: The proposed EGS framework significantly improved performance compared to previous methods on benchmarks University-1652 and SUES-200.

Conclusion: EGS establishes a new state-of-the-art in cross-view geo-localization by overcoming challenges of robustness and correspondence reliability.

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) aims to match images of the same location
captured from drastically different viewpoints. Despite recent progress,
existing methods still face two key challenges: (1) achieving robustness under
severe appearance variations induced by diverse UAV orientations and fields of
view, which hinders cross-domain generalization, and (2) establishing reliable
correspondences that capture both global scene-level semantics and fine-grained
local details. In this paper, we propose EGS, a novel CVGL framework designed
to enhance cross-domain generalization. Specifically, we introduce an
E(2)-Steerable CNN encoder to extract stable and reliable features under
rotation and viewpoint shifts. Furthermore, we construct a graph with a virtual
super-node that connects to all local nodes, enabling global semantics to be
aggregated and redistributed to local regions, thereby enforcing global-local
consistency. Extensive experiments on the University-1652 and SUES-200
benchmarks demonstrate that EGS consistently achieves substantial performance
gains and establishes a new state of the art in cross-domain CVGL.

### [122] [DENet: Dual-Path Edge Network with Global-Local Attention for Infrared Small Target Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20701)
*Jiayi Zuo,Songwei Pei,Qian Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Dual-Path Edge Network to improve infrared small target detection under cluttered backgrounds by combining edge enhancement and semantic modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infrared small targets are hard to detect due to blending into noisy backgrounds and the lack of distinct features.

Method: The method uses two paths: 1) Bidirectional Interaction Module for semantic understanding and 2) Multi-Edge Refiner for enhancing edge details using math-based operators and attention mechanisms.

Result: It achieves precise small target detection by integrating structural semantics and refined edge details.

Conclusion: The framework effectively tackles the challenges in detecting infrared small targets by combining complementary methodologies for improved accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection is crucial for remote sensing applications
like disaster warning and maritime surveillance. However, due to the lack of
distinctive texture and morphological features, infrared small targets are
highly susceptible to blending into cluttered and noisy backgrounds. A
fundamental challenge in designing deep models for this task lies in the
inherent conflict between capturing high-resolution spatial details for minute
targets and extracting robust semantic context for larger targets, often
leading to feature misalignment and suboptimal performance. Existing methods
often rely on fixed gradient operators or simplistic attention mechanisms,
which are inadequate for accurately extracting target edges under low contrast
and high noise. In this paper, we propose a novel Dual-Path Edge Network that
explicitly addresses this challenge by decoupling edge enhancement and semantic
modeling into two complementary processing paths. The first path employs a
Bidirectional Interaction Module, which uses both Local Self-Attention and
Global Self-Attention to capture multi-scale local and global feature
dependencies. The global attention mechanism, based on a Transformer
architecture, integrates long-range semantic relationships and contextual
information, ensuring robust scene understanding. The second path introduces
the Multi-Edge Refiner, which enhances fine-grained edge details using cascaded
Taylor finite difference operators at multiple scales. This mathematical
approach, along with an attention-driven gating mechanism, enables precise edge
localization and feature enhancement for targets of varying sizes, while
effectively suppressing noise. Our method provides a promising solution for
precise infrared small target detection and localization, combining structural
semantics and edge refinement in a unified framework.

*Ruixu Zhang,Yuran Wang,Xinyi Hu,Chaoyu Mai,Wenxuan Liu,Danni Xu,Xian Zhong,Zheng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the concept of group intention forecasting (GIF), presents a new dataset SHOT for studying it, and proposes a framework called GIFT for prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current intention recognition focuses on individual actions, neglecting how collective goals arise through interactions in a group setting.

Method: They propose a new dataset (SHOT) designed to capture group intention dynamics and introduce GIFT, a framework that examines individual and group-level behavior to improve forecasting accuracy.

Result: Experimental results show SHOT and GIFT successfully predict group intentions, demonstrating their robustness and setting a baseline for future studies.

Conclusion: SHOT and GIFT provide crucial tools for advancing the study of group intention forecasting, opening pathways for innovative research in scenarios needing collective behavior understanding.

Abstract: Intention recognition has traditionally focused on individual intentions,
overlooking the complexities of collective intentions in group settings. To
address this limitation, we introduce the concept of group intention, which
represents shared goals emerging through the actions of multiple individuals,
and Group Intention Forecasting (GIF), a novel task that forecasts when group
intentions will occur by analyzing individual actions and interactions before
the collective goal becomes apparent. To investigate GIF in a specific
scenario, we propose SHOT, the first large-scale dataset for GIF, consisting of
1,979 basketball video clips captured from 5 camera views and annotated with 6
types of individual attributes. SHOT is designed with 3 key characteristics:
multi-individual information, multi-view adaptability, and multi-level
intention, making it well-suited for studying emerging group intentions.
Furthermore, we introduce GIFT (Group Intention ForecasTer), a framework that
extracts fine-grained individual features and models evolving group dynamics to
forecast intention emergence. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of
SHOT and GIFT, establishing a strong foundation for future research in group
intention forecasting. The dataset is available at

*Yu Guo,Shengfeng He,Yuxu Lu,Haonan An,Yihang Tao,Huilin Zhu,Jingxian Liu,Yuguang Fang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Neptune-X, a framework utilizing synthetic data generation and active sample selection to improve maritime object detection, addressing issues with data scarcity and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models for maritime object detection struggle due to a lack of annotated data and poor performance in diverse and challenging conditions.

Method: The proposed method includes a generative model (X-to-Maritime) with a Bidirectional Object-Water Attention module to synthesize realistic scenes and an Attribute-correlated Active Sampling technique to select task-relevant samples dynamically.

Result: Experiments showcase improved maritime scene synthesis and a new benchmark in detection accuracy, particularly in underrepresented and challenging conditions.

Conclusion: Neptune-X significantly enhances maritime object detection by combining generative modeling and active sample selection, demonstrating its effectiveness for real-world applications in navigation and surveillance.

Abstract: Maritime object detection is essential for navigation safety, surveillance,
and autonomous operations, yet constrained by two key challenges: the scarcity
of annotated maritime data and poor generalization across various maritime
attributes (e.g., object category, viewpoint, location, and imaging
environment). % In particular, models trained on existing datasets often
underperform in underrepresented scenarios such as open-sea environments. To
address these challenges, we propose Neptune-X, a data-centric
generative-selection framework that enhances training effectiveness by
leveraging synthetic data generation with task-aware sample selection. From the
generation perspective, we develop X-to-Maritime, a multi-modality-conditioned
generative model that synthesizes diverse and realistic maritime scenes. A key
component is the Bidirectional Object-Water Attention module, which captures
boundary interactions between objects and their aquatic surroundings to improve
visual fidelity. To further improve downstream tasking performance, we propose
Attribute-correlated Active Sampling, which dynamically selects synthetic
samples based on their task relevance. To support robust benchmarking, we
construct the Maritime Generation Dataset, the first dataset tailored for
generative maritime learning, encompassing a wide range of semantic conditions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach sets a new benchmark in
maritime scene synthesis, significantly improving detection accuracy,
particularly in challenging and previously underrepresented settings.The code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces STELLA, a complete pipeline for Crater-Based Navigation (CBN) crucial for long-duration lunar mapping, and validates it with a realistic dataset called CRESENT-365.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of applying Crater-Based Navigation (CBN) in long-duration lunar mapping missions, given its prior focus on short-duration lunar descent contexts.

Method: STELLA integrates a Mask R-CNN-based crater detector, a robust crater identification module, a pose solver, and a batch orbit determination back-end. It is tested using a new dataset, CRESENT-365, which mimics long-term lunar mapping conditions.

Result: STELLA achieves metre-level position and sub-degree attitude accuracies across varying conditions, including wide viewing ranges and different lighting scenarios.

Conclusion: STELLA demonstrates effective and reliable CBN for year-long lunar mapping missions, marking a significant advancement in the field and providing insights for future missions.

Abstract: Crater-Based Navigation (CBN) uses the ubiquitous impact craters of the Moon
observed on images as natural landmarks to determine the six degrees of freedom
pose of a spacecraft. To date, CBN has primarily been studied in the context of
powered descent and landing. These missions are typically short in duration,
with high-frequency imagery captured from a nadir viewpoint over well-lit
terrain. In contrast, lunar mapping missions involve sparse, oblique imagery
acquired under varying illumination conditions over potentially year-long
campaigns, posing significantly greater challenges for pose estimation. We
bridge this gap with STELLA - the first end-to-end CBN pipeline for
long-duration lunar mapping. STELLA combines a Mask R-CNN-based crater
detector, a descriptor-less crater identification module, a robust
perspective-n-crater pose solver, and a batch orbit determination back-end. To
rigorously test STELLA, we introduce CRESENT-365 - the first public dataset
that emulates a year-long lunar mapping mission. Each of its 15,283 images is
rendered from high-resolution digital elevation models with SPICE-derived Sun
angles and Moon motion, delivering realistic global coverage, illumination
cycles, and viewing geometries. Experiments on CRESENT+ and CRESENT-365 show
that STELLA maintains metre-level position accuracy and sub-degree attitude
accuracy on average across wide ranges of viewing angles, illumination
conditions, and lunar latitudes. These results constitute the first
comprehensive assessment of CBN in a true lunar mapping setting and inform
operational conditions that should be considered for future missions.

### [126] [Seeing Through Words, Speaking Through Pixels: Deep Representational Alignment Between Vision and Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20751)
*Zoe Wanying He,Sean Trott,Meenakshi Khosla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study explores how vision-only and language-only deep models align semantically despite being trained on disjoint data, finding that their representations converge in mid-to-late layers, with robustness to semantic changes and strong reflection of human judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to investigate why and how deep models trained separately in vision and language converge on shared semantic representations, as well as to understand the cues and dynamics supporting this.

Method: The authors analyzed the alignment between vision-only and language-only models across layers, studied the impact of linguistic and visual changes, and extended analysis to many-to-many image-text matching tasks using a "Pick-a-Pic" preference alignment test as well as exemplar averaging.

Result: Alignment between vision and language networks peaks in mid-to-late layers and reflects a semantic, rather than appearance-based, similarity. Tests show these models reflect human preferences in image-text alignment, and averaging embeddings enhances this alignment.

Conclusion: Unimodal networks (vision-only, language-only) appear to share a robust semantic encoding space that aligns strongly with human semantic judgments and benefits from aggregation of exemplars.

Abstract: Recent studies show that deep vision-only and language-only models--trained
on disjoint modalities--nonetheless project their inputs into a partially
aligned representational space. Yet we still lack a clear picture of where in
each network this convergence emerges, what visual or linguistic cues support
it, whether it captures human preferences in many-to-many image-text scenarios,
and how aggregating exemplars of the same concept affects alignment. Here, we
systematically investigate these questions. We find that alignment peaks in
mid-to-late layers of both model types, reflecting a shift from
modality-specific to conceptually shared representations. This alignment is
robust to appearance-only changes but collapses when semantics are altered
(e.g., object removal or word-order scrambling), highlighting that the shared
code is truly semantic. Moving beyond the one-to-one image-caption paradigm, a
forced-choice "Pick-a-Pic" task shows that human preferences for image-caption
matches are mirrored in the embedding spaces across all vision-language model
pairs. This pattern holds bidirectionally when multiple captions correspond to
a single image, demonstrating that models capture fine-grained semantic
distinctions akin to human judgments. Surprisingly, averaging embeddings across
exemplars amplifies alignment rather than blurring detail. Together, our
results demonstrate that unimodal networks converge on a shared semantic code
that aligns with human judgments and strengthens with exemplar aggregation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FreeInsert, a training-free framework for realistic and geometrically controlled object insertion into images, overcoming challenges of geometric control, style consistency, and avoiding extensive training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in current image editing techniques such as lack of precise geometric control, poor style consistency, and reliance on textual inputs which hinder realistic object insertion.

Method: The FreeInsert framework converts 2D objects into 3D, enables editing at the 3D level, re-renders the updated object into a 2D image, and combines geometric, style, and content controls through diffusion-based models for realistic image integration.

Result: The framework ensures precise geometric control, maintains style consistency between object and background, and eliminates the need for extensive training.

Conclusion: FreeInsert offers a novel, efficient way to perform realistic and customized image editing by leveraging 3D geometric editing and diffusion-based models, thereby improving upon earlier limitations in the field.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have made significant progress in image
generation, allowing for effortless customized generation. However, existing
image editing methods still face certain limitations when dealing with
personalized image composition tasks. First, there is the issue of lack of
geometric control over the inserted objects. Current methods are confined to 2D
space and typically rely on textual instructions, making it challenging to
maintain precise geometric control over the objects. Second, there is the
challenge of style consistency. Existing methods often overlook the style
consistency between the inserted object and the background, resulting in a lack
of realism. In addition, the challenge of inserting objects into images without
extensive training remains significant. To address these issues, we propose
\textit{FreeInsert}, a novel training-free framework that customizes object
insertion into arbitrary scenes by leveraging 3D geometric information.
Benefiting from the advances in existing 3D generation models, we first convert
the 2D object into 3D, perform interactive editing at the 3D level, and then
re-render it into a 2D image from a specified view. This process introduces
geometric controls such as shape or view. The rendered image, serving as
geometric control, is combined with style and content control achieved through
diffusion adapters, ultimately producing geometrically controlled,
style-consistent edited images via the diffusion model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image diffusion models face challenges such as degraded scenes, insufficient control, and poor perceptual identity, which limit their practicality and usability in generating human photos.

Method: CustomEnhancer utilizes a zero-shot enhancement pipeline and introduces the triple-flow fused PerGeneration approach to unify and enhance generation and reconstruction. To improve inversion speed, it incorporates a novel ResInversion method to rectify noise efficiently.

Result: CustomEnhancer achieves state-of-the-art results in scene diversity, identity fidelity, and training-free control. Its ResInversion method reduces inversion time by 129 times compared to conventional techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed framework significantly enhances personalized text-to-image diffusion models by improving control and representation while drastically lowering computational time, without requiring additional training.

Abstract: Recently remarkable progress has been made in synthesizing realistic human
photos using text-to-image diffusion models. However, current approaches face
degraded scenes, insufficient control, and suboptimal perceptual identity. We
introduce CustomEnhancer, a novel framework to augment existing identity
customization models. CustomEnhancer is a zero-shot enhancement pipeline that
leverages face swapping techniques, pretrained diffusion model, to obtain
additional representations in a zeroshot manner for encoding into personalized
models. Through our proposed triple-flow fused PerGeneration approach, which
identifies and combines two compatible counter-directional latent spaces to
manipulate a pivotal space of personalized model, we unify the generation and
reconstruction processes, realizing generation from three flows. Our pipeline
also enables comprehensive training-free control over the generation process of
personalized models, offering precise controlled personalization for them and
eliminating the need for controller retraining for per-model. Besides, to
address the high time complexity of null-text inversion (NTI), we introduce
ResInversion, a novel inversion method that performs noise rectification via a
pre-diffusion mechanism, reducing the inversion time by 129 times. Experiments
demonstrate that CustomEnhancer reach SOTA results at scene diversity, identity
fidelity, training-free controls, while also showing the efficiency of our
ResInversion over NTI. The code will be made publicly available upon paper
acceptance.

*Hyomin Choi,Heeji Han,Chris Rosewarne,Fabien Racapé*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CompressAI-Vision is an open-source platform designed to evaluate video compression methods optimized for computer vision tasks, focusing on maintaining efficiency and task accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing need for video compression methods tailored for neural network-based computer vision tasks, given the diversity of models, tasks, and datasets.

Method: Developed an open-source evaluation platform that assesses compression efficiency versus task accuracy in two scenarios: "remote" and "split" inferencing.

Result: Various use cases and demonstrations highlight the platform's utility, and it has been adopted by MPEG for the Feature Coding for Machines (FCM) standard.

Conclusion: CompressAI-Vision serves as a foundation for developing video compression strategies, offering a collaborative framework for optimizing compression targeted at vision-related applications.

Abstract: With the increasing use of neural network (NN)-based computer vision

"split" inferencing. Our study showcases various use cases of the evaluation
platform incorporated with standard codecs (under development) by examining the
compression gain on several datasets in terms of bit-rate versus task accuracy.

### [130] [Dual-supervised Asymmetric Co-training for Semi-supervised Medical Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20785)
*Jincai Song,Haipeng Chen,Jun Qin,Na Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Dual-supervised Asymmetric Co-training (DAC) framework to tackle cross-domain semi-supervised domain generalization (CD-SSDG) challenges in medical image segmentation, particularly under domain shift conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG), particularly when domain shifts exist not only between training and testing sets but also between labeled and unlabeled training data, which conventional SSDG methods fail to handle effectively.

Method: The method involves a DAC framework with dual sub-models that perform cross pseudo supervision, feature-level supervision to manage domain shifts, and distinct self-supervised auxiliary tasks for enhancing discriminative, domain-invariant feature learning while avoiding model collapse.

Result: The proposed DAC framework demonstrates robust generalizability with better performance compared to existing SSDG approaches, validated through extensive experiments on medical image segmentation datasets like Fundus, Polyp, and SCGM.

Conclusion: The DAC framework effectively addresses the practical challenges in CD-SSDG by incorporating innovative strategies for pseudo supervision and domain-invariant feature learning, showcasing significant improvements in medical image segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG) in medical image segmentation
offers a promising solution for generalizing to unseen domains during testing,
addressing domain shift challenges and minimizing annotation costs. However,
conventional SSDG methods assume labeled and unlabeled data are available for
each source domain in the training set, a condition that is not always met in
practice. The coexistence of limited annotation and domain shift in the
training set is a prevalent issue. Thus, this paper explores a more practical
and challenging scenario, cross-domain semi-supervised domain generalization
(CD-SSDG), where domain shifts occur between labeled and unlabeled training
data, in addition to shifts between training and testing sets. Existing SSDG
methods exhibit sub-optimal performance under such domain shifts because of
inaccurate pseudolabels. To address this issue, we propose a novel
dual-supervised asymmetric co-training (DAC) framework tailored for CD-SSDG.
Building upon the co-training paradigm with two sub-models offering cross
pseudo supervision, our DAC framework integrates extra feature-level
supervision and asymmetric auxiliary tasks for each sub-model. This
feature-level supervision serves to address inaccurate pseudo supervision
caused by domain shifts between labeled and unlabeled data, utilizing
complementary supervision from the rich feature space. Additionally, two
distinct auxiliary self-supervised tasks are integrated into each sub-model to
enhance domain-invariant discriminative feature learning and prevent model
collapse. Extensive experiments on real-world medical image segmentation
datasets, i.e., Fundus, Polyp, and SCGM, demonstrate the robust
generalizability of the proposed DAC framework.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces DEIMv2, an enhanced object detection framework using DINOv3 features, delivering state-of-the-art accuracy across various deployment scenarios, from GPUs to mobile devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve real-time object detection models with superior performance-cost trade-offs, covering a wide range of model sizes for diverse deployment requirements.

Method: The proposed method integrates DINOv3-pretrained or distilled backbones, a Spatial Tuning Adapter for multi-scale processing, and ultra-lightweight HGNetv2 models for strict hardware constraints. It also introduces an upgraded Dense O2O training framework and simplified decoder.

Result: DEIMv2 achieves new state-of-the-art results, with its largest model delivering superior detection accuracy using fewer parameters, and its compact and ultra-lightweight versions offering high performance within strict resource limits.

Conclusion: DEIMv2 establishes a unified framework that spans multiple scales and scenarios, surpassing existing models in performance while optimizing cost and deployment flexibility.

Abstract: Benefiting from the simplicity and effectiveness of Dense O2O and MAL, DEIM
has become the mainstream training framework for real-time DETRs, significantly
outperforming the YOLO series. In this work, we extend it with DINOv3 features,
resulting in DEIMv2. DEIMv2 spans eight model sizes from X to Atto, covering
GPU, edge, and mobile deployment. For the X, L, M, and S variants, we adopt
DINOv3-pretrained or distilled backbones and introduce a Spatial Tuning Adapter
(STA), which efficiently converts DINOv3's single-scale output into multi-scale
features and complements strong semantics with fine-grained details to enhance
detection. For ultra-lightweight models (Nano, Pico, Femto, and Atto), we
employ HGNetv2 with depth and width pruning to meet strict resource budgets.
Together with a simplified decoder and an upgraded Dense O2O, this unified
design enables DEIMv2 to achieve a superior performance-cost trade-off across
diverse scenarios, establishing new state-of-the-art results. Notably, our
largest model, DEIMv2-X, achieves 57.8 AP with only 50.3 million parameters,
surpassing prior X-scale models that require over 60 million parameters for
just 56.5 AP. On the compact side, DEIMv2-S is the first sub-10 million model
(9.71 million) to exceed the 50 AP milestone on COCO, reaching 50.9 AP. Even
the ultra-lightweight DEIMv2-Pico, with just 1.5 million parameters, delivers
38.5 AP, matching YOLOv10-Nano (2.3 million) with around 50 percent fewer
parameters.

*Ved Umrajkar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAC-LoRA introduces a dynamic adversarial training approach that enhances the robustness of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) against adversarial attacks while maintaining high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs are critical for applications like autonomous driving and medical diagnosis but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, jeopardizing their reliability in safety-critical situations.

Method: DAC-LoRA utilizes an intelligent, progressively challenging adversarial curriculum based on the First-Order Stationary Condition (FOSC) and a TRADES-inspired loss, integrated into PEFT frameworks like LoRA.

Result: The framework improves adversarial robustness of VLMs significantly without degrading their clean accuracy and is compatible with standard PEFT pipelines.

Conclusion: DAC-LoRA offers a lightweight and effective solution to bolster the security of VLMs, making it adaptable for broad applications.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are foundational to critical applications like
autonomous driving, medical diagnosis, and content moderation. While
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA enable their efficient
adaptation to specialized tasks, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial
attacks that can compromise safety-critical decisions. CLIP, the backbone for
numerous downstream VLMs, is a high-value target whose vulnerabilities can
cascade across the multimodal AI ecosystem. We propose Dynamic Adversarial
Curriculum DAC-LoRA, a novel framework that integrates adversarial training
into PEFT. The core principle of our method i.e. an intelligent curriculum of
progressively challenging attack, is general and can potentially be applied to
any iterative attack method. Guided by the First-Order Stationary Condition
(FOSC) and a TRADES-inspired loss, DAC-LoRA achieves substantial improvements
in adversarial robustness without significantly compromising clean accuracy.
Our work presents an effective, lightweight, and broadly applicable method to
demonstrate that the DAC-LoRA framework can be easily integrated into a
standard PEFT pipeline to significantly enhance robustness.

*Jianhan Wu,Xiaoyang Qu,Zhangcheng Huang,Jianzong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedDSPG uses domain-specific soft prompts generated during training to enhance federated domain generalization, improving adaptation to unseen domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of domain shifts and limited diversity in federated domain generalization using prompt learning.

Method: The method generates domain-specific soft prompts (DSPs) by integrating content and domain knowledge in a generative model, which guides adaptation to unseen domains during inference.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results in federated domain generalization across multiple public datasets.

Conclusion: FedDSPG proves to be a highly effective strategy for federated domain generalization, outperforming strong baselines and tackling challenges in unseen domains.

Abstract: Prompt learning has become an efficient paradigm for adapting CLIP to
downstream tasks. Compared with traditional fine-tuning, prompt learning
optimizes a few parameters yet yields highly competitive results, especially
appealing in federated learning for computational efficiency. engendering
domain shift among clients and posing a formidable challenge for
downstream-task adaptation. Existing federated domain generalization (FDG)
methods based on prompt learning typically learn soft prompts from training
samples, replacing manually designed prompts to enhance the generalization
ability of federated models. However, these learned prompts exhibit limited
diversity and tend to ignore information from unknown domains. We propose a
novel and effective method from a generative perspective for handling FDG
tasks, namely federated domain generalization with domain-specific soft prompts
generation (FedDSPG). Specifically, during training, we introduce
domain-specific soft prompts (DSPs) for each domain and integrate content and
domain knowledge into the generative model among clients. In the inference
phase, the generator is utilized to obtain DSPs for unseen target domains, thus
guiding downstream tasks in unknown domains. Comprehensive evaluations across
several public datasets confirm that our method outperforms existing strong
baselines in FDG, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Low back pain affects millions worldwide, driving the need for robust
diagnostic models that can jointly analyze complex medical images and
accompanying text reports. We present LumbarCLIP, a novel multimodal framework
that leverages contrastive language-image pretraining to align lumbar spine MRI
scans with corresponding radiological descriptions. Built upon a curated
dataset containing axial MRI views paired with expert-written reports,
LumbarCLIP integrates vision encoders (ResNet-50, Vision Transformer, Swin
Transformer) with a BERT-based text encoder to extract dense representations.
These are projected into a shared embedding space via learnable projection
heads, configurable as linear or non-linear, and normalized to facilitate
stable contrastive training using a soft CLIP loss. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on downstream classification, reaching up to
95.00% accuracy and 94.75% F1-score on the test set, despite inherent class

TL;DR: PoisonVID is a black-box poisoning attack targeting prompt-guided frame sampling in Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs), achieving up to 99% attack success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the vulnerabilities in prompt-guided frame sampling for VideoLLMs, which remain unexplored despite its importance in ensuring model effectiveness.

Method: The paper introduces PoisonVID, which utilizes a closed-loop optimization strategy. It employs a universal perturbation to suppress frame relevance scores, using a shadow VideoLLM and a lightweight model, GPT-4o-mini, alongside paraphrased harmful descriptions.

Result: PoisonVID successfully compromises prompt-guided sampling across three VideoLLMs, achieving attack success rates ranging from 82% to 99%.

Conclusion: The work highlights vulnerabilities in prompt-guided sampling and calls for enhanced advanced sampling strategies to bolster VideoLLM safety and effectiveness.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
understanding videos, supporting tasks such as summarization, captioning, and
question answering. Their performance has been driven by advances in frame
sampling, progressing from uniform-based to semantic-similarity-based and, most
recently, prompt-guided strategies. While vulnerabilities have been identified
in earlier sampling strategies, the safety of prompt-guided sampling remains
unexplored. We close this gap by presenting PoisonVID, the first black-box
poisoning attack that undermines prompt-guided sampling in VideoLLMs. PoisonVID
compromises the underlying prompt-guided sampling mechanism through a
closed-loop optimization strategy that iteratively optimizes a universal
perturbation to suppress harmful frame relevance scores, guided by a depiction
set constructed from paraphrased harmful descriptions leveraging a shadow
VideoLLM and a lightweight language model, i.e., GPT-4o-mini. Comprehensively
evaluated on three prompt-guided sampling strategies and across three advanced
VideoLLMs, PoisonVID achieves 82% - 99% attack success rate, highlighting the
importance of developing future advanced sampling strategies for VideoLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Game of Regularizer (GoR), a novel method enhancing quantization-aware training (QAT) with knowledge distillation (KD) for neural network compression, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing QAT-KD methods struggle to balance task-specific and distillation losses due to heterogeneous gradient magnitudes, especially under low-bit quantization.

Method: Proposed GoR, a learnable regularization method that dynamically balances task-specific and distillation losses using two trainable parameters. Additionally introduced EKD-GoR for ensemble distillation with multiple teacher models.

Result: GoR demonstrates superior performance in image classification, object detection, and large language model compression, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods. It also delivers faster inference on edge devices with near full-precision accuracy.

Conclusion: GoR effectively reduces conflicts between supervision signals, enhances convergence, and provides a robust real-world deployment solution for compressed neural networks under resource constraints.

Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) combined with knowledge distillation (KD)
is a promising strategy for compressing Artificial Intelligence (AI) models for
deployment on resource-constrained hardware. However, existing QAT-KD methods
often struggle to balance task-specific (TS) and distillation losses due to
heterogeneous gradient magnitudes, especially under low-bit quantization. We
propose Game of Regularizer (GoR), a novel learnable regularization method that
adaptively balances TS and KD objectives using only two trainable parameters
for dynamic loss weighting. GoR reduces conflict between supervision signals,
improves convergence, and boosts the performance of small quantized models
(SQMs). Experiments on image classification, object detection (OD), and large
language model (LLM) compression show that GoR consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art QAT-KD methods. On low-power edge devices, it delivers faster
inference while maintaining full-precision accuracy. We also introduce
QAT-EKD-GoR, an ensemble distillation framework that uses multiple
heterogeneous teacher models. Under optimal conditions, the proposed EKD-GoR
can outperform full-precision models, providing a robust solution for
real-world deployment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper focuses on the 2017 LifeCLEF plant identification challenge, which explores automated identification systems for over 10,000 plant species using 1.1M images. It evaluates the ability of large, noisy datasets from the web to compete with smaller, expert-verified datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from improving automated plant identification systems at a continental scale, leveraging recent advances in deep learning and visual data aggregation, while addressing the challenge of insufficiently illustrated plant species.

Method: The challenge compared two training strategies: one using a large but noisy dataset collected from the web and another using a smaller yet trusted dataset verified by experts. The test data was sourced from the Pl@ntNet mobile application.

Result: The study provided insights into the effectiveness of noisy web-based datasets and summarized the tools, approaches, and outcomes of participating systems.

Conclusion: The findings inform the trade-offs between dataset scale and quality, emphasizing the potential of web-collected data even with labeling errors, in advancing automated plant identification.

Abstract: The 2017-th edition of the LifeCLEF plant identification challenge is an
important milestone towards automated plant identification systems working at
the scale of continental floras with 10.000 plant species living mainly in
Europe and North America illustrated by a total of 1.1M images. Nowadays, such
ambitious systems are enabled thanks to the conjunction of the dazzling recent
progress in image classification with deep learning and several outstanding
international initiatives, such as the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL), aggregating
the visual knowledge on plant species coming from the main national botany
institutes. However, despite all these efforts the majority of the plant
species still remain without pictures or are poorly illustrated. Outside the
institutional channels, a much larger number of plant pictures are available
and spread on the web through botanist blogs, plant lovers web-pages, image
hosting websites and on-line plant retailers. The LifeCLEF 2017 plant challenge
presented in this paper aimed at evaluating to what extent a large noisy
training dataset collected through the web and containing a lot of labelling
errors can compete with a smaller but trusted training dataset checked by
experts. To fairly compare both training strategies, the test dataset was
created from a third data source, i.e. the Pl@ntNet mobile application that
collects millions of plant image queries all over the world. This paper
presents more precisely the resources and assessments of the challenge,
summarizes the approaches and systems employed by the participating research
groups, and provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

TL;DR: This paper introduces TasselNetV4, a model for class-agnostic, cross-species plant counting, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of plant biodiversity and the impracticality of building species-dependent counting models, motivated by the need for a universal, efficient solution to count plants in varied environments.

Method: TasselNetV4, based on a vision transformer, integrates a novel multi-branch box-aware local counting approach to enhance cross-scale robustness for class-agnostic plant counting.

Result: TasselNetV4 achieves superior counting performance and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art models on two datasets (PAC-105 and PAC-Somalia).

Conclusion: TasselNetV4 stands as a foundational tool for cross-scene, cross-scale, and cross-species plant counting, effectively addressing the challenges in the domain.

Abstract: Accurate plant counting provides valuable information for agriculture such as
crop yield prediction, plant density assessment, and phenotype quantification.
Vision-based approaches are currently the mainstream solution. Prior art
typically uses a detection or a regression model to count a specific plant.
However, plants have biodiversity, and new cultivars are increasingly bred each
year. It is almost impossible to exhaust and build all species-dependent
counting models. Inspired by class-agnostic counting (CAC) in computer vision,
we argue that it is time to rethink the problem formulation of plant counting,
from what plants to count to how to count plants. In contrast to most daily
objects with spatial and temporal invariance, plants are dynamic, changing with
time and space. Their non-rigid structure often leads to worse performance than
counting rigid instances like heads and cars such that current CAC and
open-world detection models are suboptimal to count plants. In this work, we
inherit the vein of the TasselNet plant counting model and introduce a new
extension, TasselNetV4, shifting from species-specific counting to
cross-species counting. TasselNetV4 marries the local counting idea of
TasselNet with the extract-and-match paradigm in CAC. It builds upon a plain
vision transformer and incorporates novel multi-branch box-aware local counters
used to enhance cross-scale robustness. Two challenging datasets, PAC-105 and
PAC-Somalia, are harvested. Extensive experiments against state-of-the-art CAC
models show that TasselNetV4 achieves not only superior counting performance
but also high efficiency.Our results indicate that TasselNetV4 emerges to be a
vision foundation model for cross-scene, cross-scale, and cross-species plant
counting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a semi-supervised learning model with a biomarker topology engine for anatomically correct segmentation of retinal layers and lesions, outperforming current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in retinal OCT segmentation methods, such as anatomical implausibility, poor modeling of layer-lesion interactions, and lack of topological correctness guarantees.

Method: Develop a semi-supervised model incorporating a fully differentiable biomarker topology engine, enabling anatomically correct and disentangled spatial-style segmentation of retinal layers and lesions.

Result: The proposed model surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both lesion and layer segmentation, demonstrating enhanced generalizability and robustness in pathological cases.

Conclusion: Anatomical constraints in semi-supervised learning improve retinal segmentation performance, offering more accurate and trustworthy diagnostic tools for retinal disease monitoring.

Abstract: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is widely used for diagnosing and
monitoring retinal diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
The segmentation of biomarkers such as layers and lesions is essential for
patient diagnosis and follow-up. Recently, semi-supervised learning has shown
promise in improving retinal segmentation performance. However, existing
methods often produce anatomically implausible segmentations, fail to
effectively model layer-lesion interactions, and lack guarantees on topological
correctness.
  To address these limitations, we propose a novel semi-supervised model that
introduces a fully differentiable biomarker topology engine to enforce
anatomically correct segmentation of lesions and layers. This enables joint
learning with bidirectional influence between layers and lesions, leveraging
unlabeled and diverse partially labeled datasets. Our model learns a
disentangled representation, separating spatial and style factors. This
approach enables more realistic layer segmentations and improves lesion
segmentation, while strictly enforcing lesion location in their anatomically
plausible positions relative to the segmented layers.
  We evaluate the proposed model on public and internal datasets of OCT scans
and show that it outperforms the current state-of-the-art in both lesion and
layer segmentation, while demonstrating the ability to generalize layer
segmentation to pathological cases using partially annotated training data. Our
results demonstrate the potential of using anatomical constraints in
semi-supervised learning for accurate, robust, and trustworthy retinal
biomarker segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance plant identification methods for real-world biodiversity monitoring and tackle the challenges posed by unknown categories in open-set recognition tasks.

Method: The challenge used a dataset of 110K images representing 1000 plant species from West Europe, evaluated through participatory sensing and focused on open-set recognition systems.

Result: The paper analyzes the performance of methods adopted by research groups, focusing on their ability to reject false positives and identify known classes effectively.

Conclusion: The paper highlights key insights into the challenges of plant identification at scale, especially the need for robust mechanisms to handle unknown species.

Abstract: The LifeCLEF plant identification challenge aims at evaluating plant
identification methods and systems at a very large scale, close to the
conditions of a real-world biodiversity monitoring scenario. The 2016-th
edition was actually conducted on a set of more than 110K images illustrating
1000 plant species living in West Europe, built through a large-scale
participatory sensing platform initiated in 2011 and which now involves tens of
thousands of contributors. The main novelty over the previous years is that the
identification task was evaluated as an open-set recognition problem, i.e. a
problem in which the recognition system has to be robust to unknown and never
seen categories. Beyond the brute-force classification across the known classes
of the training set, the big challenge was thus to automatically reject the
false positive classification hits that are caused by the unknown classes. This
overview presents more precisely the resources and assessments of the
challenge, summarizes the approaches and systems employed by the participating
research groups, and provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SCRA-VQA, a method to improve knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (VQA) by summarizing and reranking captions to help large language models (LLMs) focus on relevant information, leading to enhanced performance without expensive training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current KB-VQA methods that rely on noisy image captions and limited reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in VQA tasks.

Method: SCRA-VQA uses a pre-trained visual language model to generate captions for images, then creates contextual examples, summarizes, and reorders captions to eliminate irrelevant information. This process improves LLMs' understanding and reasoning without requiring full end-to-end training.

Result: SCRA-VQA achieved high accuracy on two knowledge-based VQA datasets: OK-VQA (38.8%) and A-OKVQA (34.6%), utilizing an LLM with 6.7B parameters.

Conclusion: The caption-reranking approach enables SCRA-VQA to refine noisy visual data and enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, offering an efficient and effective solution for knowledge-based VQA tasks without extensive training.

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality knowledge is a central focus in Knowledge-Based Visual
Question Answering (KB-VQA). Recent methods use large language models (LLMs) as
knowledge engines for answering. These methods generally employ image captions
as visual text descriptions to assist LLMs in interpreting images. However, the
captions frequently include excessive noise irrelevant to the question, and
LLMs generally do not comprehend VQA tasks, limiting their reasoning
capabilities. To address this issue, we propose the Summarized Caption-Rerank
Augmented VQA (SCRA-VQA), which employs a pre-trained visual language model to
convert images into captions. Moreover, SCRA-VQA generates contextual examples
for the captions while simultaneously summarizing and reordering them to
exclude unrelated information. The caption-rerank process enables LLMs to
understand the image information and questions better, thus enhancing the
model's reasoning ability and task adaptability without expensive end-to-end
training. Based on an LLM with 6.7B parameters, SCRA-VQA performs excellently
on two challenging knowledge-based VQA datasets: OK-VQA and A-OKVQA, achieving
accuracies of 38.8% and 34.6%. Our code is available at

Motivation: To bridge the gap between the effectiveness of objectives like fidelity and adversarial metrics for perceptual optimization and their functionality in IQA.

Method: Systematic analysis of fidelity and adversarial objectives, study of discriminator architectures, and evaluation of their performance in perceptual optimization and IQA.

Result: Fidelity metrics excel in IQA but are less effective for optimization under adversarial training. Discriminators suppress artifacts successfully, but their representations have limited reuse potential in IQA models.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes the importance of aligning loss function design with the distinct demands of perceptual optimization and IQA transferability for better image quality results.

Abstract: Perceptual optimization is primarily driven by the fidelity objective, which
enforces both semantic consistency and overall visual realism, while the
adversarial objective provides complementary refinement by enhancing perceptual
sharpness and fine-grained detail. Despite their central role, the correlation
between their effectiveness as optimization objectives and their capability as
image quality assessment (IQA) metrics remains underexplored. In this work, we
conduct a systematic analysis and reveal an unanticipated asymmetry between
perceptual optimization and assessment: fidelity metrics that excel in IQA are
not necessarily effective for perceptual optimization, with this misalignment
emerging more distinctly under adversarial training. In addition, while
discriminators effectively suppress artifacts during optimization, their
learned representations offer only limited benefits when reused as backbone
initializations for IQA models. Beyond this asymmetry, our findings further
demonstrate that discriminator design plays a decisive role in shaping
optimization, with patch-level and convolutional architectures providing more
faithful detail reconstruction than vanilla or Transformer-based alternatives.
These insights advance the understanding of loss function design and its
connection to IQA transferability, paving the way for more principled
approaches to perceptual optimization.

*Zhifei Li,Feng Qiu,Yiran Wang,Yujing Xia,Kui Xiao,Miao Zhang,Yan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IOG-VQA improves Visual Question Answering (VQA) performance by integrating Object Interaction Self-Attention and GAN-Based Debiasing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges of visual reasoning and biases in training data that impair generalization in VQA models.

Method: The model uses a self-attention mechanism to capture object interactions and a GAN-based framework to generate unbiased data.

Result: Experimental results show its superior performance on VQA-CP v1 and VQA-CP v2 datasets, especially in handling biased data.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully advances VQA tasks by addressing visual understanding and dataset biases.

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) presents a unique challenge by requiring
models to understand and reason about visual content to answer questions
accurately. Existing VQA models often struggle with biases introduced by the
training data, leading to over-reliance on superficial patterns and inadequate
generalization to diverse questions and images. This paper presents a novel
model, IOG-VQA, which integrates Object Interaction Self-Attention and
GAN-Based Debiasing to enhance VQA model performance. The self-attention
mechanism allows our model to capture complex interactions between objects
within an image, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the visual
context. Meanwhile, the GAN-based debiasing framework generates unbiased data
distributions, helping the model to learn more robust and generalizable
features. By leveraging these two components, IOG-VQA effectively combines
visual and textual information to address the inherent biases in VQA datasets.
Extensive experiments on the VQA-CP v1 and VQA-CP v2 datasets demonstrate that
our model shows excellent performance compared with the existing methods,
particularly in handling biased and imbalanced data distributions highlighting
the importance of addressing both object interactions and dataset biases in
advancing VQA tasks. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid model combining low-rank temporal modeling with diffusion posterior sampling to enhance video restoration performance, specifically tested on cardiac ultrasound dehazing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address shortcomings of robust principal component methods, which fail to capture the rich variability in real-world video sequences due to overly strict sparsity assumptions.

Method: A hybrid framework, called Nuclear Diffusion, integrates low-rank temporal modeling with diffusion posterior sampling.

Result: The approach outperforms traditional RPCA in a medical imaging context (cardiac ultrasound) by enhancing contrast (gCNR) and preserving key signals (KS statistic).

Conclusion: Combining model-based temporal models with deep generative priors can significantly improve the fidelity of video restoration.

Abstract: Video sequences often contain structured noise and background artifacts that
obscure dynamic content, posing challenges for accurate analysis and
restoration. Robust principal component methods address this by decomposing
data into low-rank and sparse components. Still, the sparsity assumption often
fails to capture the rich variability present in real video data. To overcome
this limitation, a hybrid framework that integrates low-rank temporal modeling
with diffusion posterior sampling is proposed. The proposed method, Nuclear
Diffusion, is evaluated on a real-world medical imaging problem, namely cardiac
ultrasound dehazing, and demonstrates improved dehazing performance compared to
traditional RPCA concerning contrast enhancement (gCNR) and signal preservation
(KS statistic). These results highlight the potential of combining model-based
temporal models with deep generative priors for high-fidelity video
restoration.

TL;DR: The paper introduces FerretNet, a compact neural network for efficient synthetic image detection, achieving superior accuracy across various generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of detecting increasingly realistic synthetic images generated by models like VAEs, GANs, and LDMs.

Method: Leveraging local pixel dependencies rooted in Markov Random Fields to reconstruct textures and edges in synthetic images, and designing FerretNet for detection.

Result: FerretNet achieves 97.1% average accuracy on a benchmark spanning 22 generative models, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 10.6%.

Conclusion: The approach and FerretNet provide an effective tool for identifying disruptions in texture continuity and edge coherence in synthetic images, advancing detection capabilities.

Abstract: The increasing realism of synthetic images generated by advanced models such
as VAEs, GANs, and LDMs poses significant challenges for synthetic image
detection. To address this issue, we explore two artifact types introduced
during the generation process: (1) latent distribution deviations and (2)
decoding-induced smoothing effects, which manifest as inconsistencies in local
textures, edges, and color transitions. Leveraging local pixel dependencies
(LPD) properties rooted in Markov Random Fields, we reconstruct synthetic
images using neighboring pixel information to expose disruptions in texture
continuity and edge coherence. Building upon LPD, we propose FerretNet, a
lightweight neural network with only 1.1M parameters that delivers efficient
and robust synthetic image detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FerretNet, trained exclusively on the 4-class ProGAN dataset, achieves an
average accuracy of 97.1% on an open-world benchmark comprising across 22
generative models, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by 10.6%.

*Patrick Knab,Sascha Marton,Philipp J. Schubert,Drago Guggiana,Christian Bartelt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents MoTIF, a framework inspired by transformers, extending concept bottleneck models (CBMs) from image classification to video classification, with a focus on temporal concept dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the challenge of adapting Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs), which are originally designed for static image classification, to video classification where temporal dependencies are critical for understanding actions and events.

Method: The method involves introducing MoTIF, a transformer-based architecture that adapts the CBM framework for handling video sequences of arbitrary length. It focuses on capturing and analyzing global, local, and temporal dependencies of concepts that collectively form actionable motifs.

Result: Experiments show that MoTIF effectively transfers the concept-based modeling paradigm to video data, enhances understanding of temporal contexts, and achieves competitive performance in video classification tasks.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that MoTIF successfully adapts CBMs for video classification, offering interpretable insights into concept contributions over time while maintaining high performance.

Abstract: Conceptual models such as Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have driven
substantial progress in improving interpretability for image classification by
leveraging human-interpretable concepts. However, extending these models from
static images to sequences of images, such as video data, introduces a
significant challenge due to the temporal dependencies inherent in videos,
which are essential for capturing actions and events. In this work, we
introduce MoTIF (Moving Temporal Interpretable Framework), an architectural
design inspired by a transformer that adapts the concept bottleneck framework
for video classification and handles sequences of arbitrary length. Within the
video domain, concepts refer to semantic entities such as objects, attributes,
or higher-level components (e.g., 'bow', 'mount', 'shoot') that reoccur across
time - forming motifs collectively describing and explaining actions. Our
design explicitly enables three complementary perspectives: global concept
importance across the entire video, local concept relevance within specific
windows, and temporal dependencies of a concept over time. Our results
demonstrate that the concept-based modeling paradigm can be effectively
transferred to video data, enabling a better understanding of concept
contributions in temporal contexts while maintaining competitive performance.

Conclusion: FSMODNet proves effective in few-shot multispectral object detection, offering adaptability in diverse conditions and advancing detection methods for limited annotations.

Abstract: Few-shot multispectral object detection (FSMOD) addresses the challenge of
detecting objects across visible and thermal modalities with minimal annotated

detection performance even with limited labels. By effectively combining the
unique strengths of visible and thermal imagery using deformable attention, the
proposed method demonstrates robust adaptability in complex illumination and
environmental conditions. Experimental results on two public datasets show
effective object detection performance in challenging low-data regimes,

*Julius Pesonen,Arno Solin,Eija Honkavaara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a particle filter-based approach for 3D object localisation using camera measurements, especially suitable for distant objects or resource-limited tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety-critical tasks such as drone-based wildfire monitoring require reliable object localisation, but existing methods like dense depth estimation fail under certain constraints (e.g., distant objects or limited computational resources).

Method: The authors propose using a particle filter technique to solve the localisation problem. They test this in 3D simulations and real-world drone-based image segmentation sequences with GNSS-based camera pose estimates.

Result: The particle filter method performs effectively in scenarios where traditional localisation methods fail. It is flexible and adaptable regardless of the detection method used.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates particle filters as a feasible and resource-efficient tool for 3D object localisation in safety-critical applications such as drone-based wildfire monitoring.

Abstract: 3D object localisation based on a sequence of camera measurements is
essential for safety-critical surveillance tasks, such as drone-based wildfire
monitoring. Localisation of objects detected with a camera can typically be
solved with dense depth estimation or 3D scene reconstruction. However, in the
context of distant objects or tasks limited by the amount of available
computational resources, neither solution is feasible. In this paper, we show
that the task can be solved using particle filters for both single and multiple
target scenarios. The method was studied using a 3D simulation and a
drone-based image segmentation sequence with global navigation satellite system
(GNSS)-based camera pose estimates. The results showed that a particle filter
can be used to solve practical localisation tasks based on camera poses and
image segments in these situations where other solutions fail. The particle
filter is independent of the detection method, making it flexible for new
tasks. The study also demonstrates that drone-based wildfire monitoring can be
conducted using the proposed method paired with a pre-existing image
segmentation model.

*Qinfeng Zhu,Han Li,Liang He,Lei Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SwinMamba, a novel segmentation model for remote sensing imagery that combines local and global scanning to capture fine-grained details and broader contextual information, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Remote sensing image segmentation faces challenges like high spatial resolution, complex scene structures, and diverse object scales. Current solutions like Vision Mamba overlook critical local features such as textures and edges.

Method: SwinMamba integrates local Mamba-style scanning within shifted windows for capturing fine-grained details and global receptive fields for broader context. It uses shifted overlapping windows to enhance inter-region information exchange.

Result: SwinMamba demonstrated superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in segmentation tasks on the LoveDA and ISPRS Potsdam datasets.

Conclusion: SwinMamba effectively balances the capture of local and global features, making it a strong candidate for semantic segmentation in remote sensing imagery.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery is a fundamental task in
computer vision, supporting a wide range of applications such as land use
classification, urban planning, and environmental monitoring. However, this
task is often challenged by the high spatial resolution, complex scene
structures, and diverse object scales present in remote sensing data. To
address these challenges, various deep learning architectures have been
proposed, including convolutional neural networks, Vision Transformers, and the
recently introduced Vision Mamba. Vision Mamba features a global receptive
field and low computational complexity, demonstrating both efficiency and
effectiveness in image segmentation. However, its reliance on global scanning
tends to overlook critical local features, such as textures and edges, which
are essential for achieving accurate segmentation in remote sensing contexts.
To tackle this limitation, we propose SwinMamba, a novel framework inspired by
the Swin Transformer. SwinMamba integrates localized Mamba-style scanning
within shifted windows with a global receptive field, to enhance the model's
perception of both local and global features. Specifically, the first two
stages of SwinMamba perform local scanning to capture fine-grained details,
while its subsequent two stages leverage global scanning to fuse broader
contextual information. In our model, the use of overlapping shifted windows
enhances inter-region information exchange, facilitating more robust feature
integration across the entire image. Extensive experiments on the LoveDA and
ISPRS Potsdam datasets demonstrate that SwinMamba outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, underscoring its effectiveness and potential as a superior solution
for semantic segmentation of remotely sensed imagery.

*Wenhao Tang,Heng Fang,Ge Wu,Xiang Li,Ming-Ming Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel framework for computational pathology handling high data heterogeneity and redundancy in digitized pathology slides.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches in computational pathology fail to efficiently address high sequence length variations and limited supervision in pathology slides.

Method: A pack-based MIL framework is proposed that packs variable-length feature sequences, introduces hyperslides for multi-slide supervision, and uses an attention-driven feature downsampler.

Result: The proposed method improves accuracy by 8% and reduces training time to only 12%, showcasing efficiency and effectiveness.

Conclusion: Focusing on data challenges in computational pathology shows great promise, especially in the context of foundation models.

Abstract: Computational pathology (CPath) digitizes pathology slides into whole slide
images (WSIs), enabling analysis for critical healthcare tasks such as cancer
diagnosis and prognosis. However, WSIs possess extremely long sequence lengths
(up to 200K), significant length variations (from 200 to 200K), and limited
supervision. These extreme variations in sequence length lead to high data
heterogeneity and redundancy. Conventional methods often compromise on training
efficiency and optimization to preserve such heterogeneity under limited
supervision. To comprehensively address these challenges, we propose a
pack-based MIL framework. It packs multiple sampled, variable-length feature
sequences into fixed-length ones, enabling batched training while preserving
data heterogeneity. Moreover, we introduce a residual branch that composes
discarded features from multiple slides into a hyperslide which is trained with
tailored labels. It offers multi-slide supervision while mitigating feature
loss from sampling. Meanwhile, an attention-driven downsampler is introduced to
compress features in both branches to reduce redundancy. By alleviating these
challenges, our approach achieves an accuracy improvement of up to 8% while
using only 12% of the training time in the PANDA(UNI). Extensive experiments
demonstrate that focusing data challenges in CPath holds significant potential
in the era of foundation models. The code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents SimDiff, a diffusion model for efficiently generating physically plausible human motion while incorporating environmental parameters directly into the model, eliminating the need for costly simulator-based motion projection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the computational inefficiencies associated with existing simulator-based motion projection methods used for generating physically plausible human motion.

Method: The authors introduce a Simulator-constrained Diffusion Model (SimDiff) that directly integrates environment settings like gravity and wind into the denoising process during diffusion, removing reliance on sequential simulator calls for motion projection.

Result: SimDiff generates physically plausible human motions efficiently and can generalize to unseen combinations of environmental parameters, offering fine-grained control over physical coefficients.

Conclusion: SimDiff provides a computationally efficient alternative to simulator-based methods, while maintaining physical plausibility and allowing for compositional generalization to new environmental setups.

Abstract: Generating physically plausible human motion is crucial for applications such
as character animation and virtual reality. Existing approaches often
incorporate a simulator-based motion projection layer to the diffusion process
to enforce physical plausibility. However, such methods are computationally
expensive due to the sequential nature of the simulator, which prevents
parallelization. We show that simulator-based motion projection can be
interpreted as a form of guidance, either classifier-based or classifier-free,
within the diffusion process. Building on this insight, we propose SimDiff, a
Simulator-constrained Diffusion Model that integrates environment parameters
(e.g., gravity, wind) directly into the denoising process. By conditioning on
these parameters, SimDiff generates physically plausible motions efficiently,
without repeated simulator calls at inference, and also provides fine-grained
control over different physical coefficients. Moreover, SimDiff successfully
generalizes to unseen combinations of environmental parameters, demonstrating
compositional generalization.

*Bum Jun Kim,Makoto Kawano,Yusuke Iwasawa,Yutaka Matsuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper analyzes why certain vision architectures are more robust to Gaussian noise, drawing theoretical and empirical insights to suggest actionable design improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why robustness against Gaussian noise differs across vision models and translate this understanding into practical design guidelines.

Method: Performing evaluations on 1,174 pretrained vision models to identify robustness patterns, followed by theoretical analyses to explain empirical observations.

Result: Identified design rules like larger stem kernels, smaller input resolutions, average pooling, and supervised ViTs over CLIP ViTs, leading to significant accuracy and rank improvements.

Conclusion: The findings explain robustness differences via nuanced theoretical insights, offering clear and actionable guidelines for designing robust vision models.

Abstract: While the robustness of vision models is often measured, their dependence on
specific architectural design choices is rarely dissected. We investigate why
certain vision architectures are inherently more robust to additive Gaussian
noise and convert these empirical insights into simple, actionable design
rules. Specifically, we performed extensive evaluations on 1,174 pretrained
vision models, empirically identifying four consistent design patterns for
improved robustness against Gaussian noise: larger stem kernels, smaller input
resolutions, average pooling, and supervised vision transformers (ViTs) rather
than CLIP ViTs, which yield up to 506 rank improvements and 21.6\%p accuracy
gains. We then develop a theoretical analysis that explains these findings,
converting observed correlations into causal mechanisms. First, we prove that
low-pass stem kernels attenuate noise with a gain that decreases quadratically
with kernel size and that anti-aliased downsampling reduces noise energy
roughly in proportion to the square of the downsampling factor. Second, we
demonstrate that average pooling is unbiased and suppresses noise in proportion
to the pooling window area, whereas max pooling incurs a positive bias that
grows slowly with window size and yields a relatively higher mean-squared error
and greater worst-case sensitivity. Third, we reveal and explain the
vulnerability of CLIP ViTs via a pixel-space Lipschitz bound: The smaller
normalization standard deviations used in CLIP preprocessing amplify worst-case
sensitivity by up to 1.91 times relative to the Inception-style preprocessing
common in supervised ViTs. Our results collectively disentangle robustness into
interpretable modules, provide a theory that explains the observed trends, and
build practical, plug-and-play guidelines for designing vision models more
robust against Gaussian noise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the role and progress of scene graphs in surgical settings and to identify existing research gaps and future directions.

Method: A PRISMA-ScR-guided scoping review was conducted, analyzing existing SG research in surgery for applications, methodologies, and trends.

Result: The study found rapid advancements in SGs, particularly in methods using foundation models for surgical contexts, but identified a notable 'data divide' between real-world and simulated data usage.

Conclusion: Scene graphs have become pivotal in surgery for tasks like workflow recognition and simulation but face issues like data annotation and real-time implementation, which are being actively addressed.

Abstract: Scene graphs (SGs) provide structured relational representations crucial for
decoding complex, dynamic surgical environments. This PRISMA-ScR-guided scoping
review systematically maps the evolving landscape of SG research in surgery,
charting its applications, methodological advancements, and future directions.
Our analysis reveals rapid growth, yet uncovers a critical 'data divide':
internal-view research (e.g., triplet recognition) almost exclusively uses
real-world 2D video, while external-view 4D modeling relies heavily on
simulated data, exposing a key translational research gap. Methodologically,
the field has advanced from foundational graph neural networks to specialized
foundation models that now significantly outperform generalist large
vision-language models in surgical contexts. This progress has established SGs
as a cornerstone technology for both analysis, such as workflow recognition and
automated safety monitoring, and generative tasks like controllable surgical
simulation. Although challenges in data annotation and real-time implementation
persist, they are actively being addressed through emerging techniques.
Surgical SGs are maturing into an essential semantic bridge, enabling a new
generation of intelligent systems to improve surgical safety, efficiency, and
training.

Conclusion: The proposed system offers a cost-effective, highly accurate automated solution for quality control, reducing manual inspection challenges and processing time.

Abstract: We present an automated vision-based system for defect detection and
classification of laser power meter sensor coatings. Our approach addresses the
critical challenge of identifying coating defects such as thermal damage and
scratches that can compromise laser energy measurement accuracy in medical and
industrial applications. The system employs an unsupervised anomaly detection
framework that trains exclusively on ``good'' sensor images to learn normal
coating distribution patterns, enabling detection of both known and novel
defect types without requiring extensive labeled defect datasets. Our
methodology consists of three key components: (1) a robust preprocessing
pipeline using Laplacian edge detection and K-means clustering to segment the
area of interest, (2) synthetic data augmentation via StyleGAN2, and (3) a
UFlow-based neural network architecture for multi-scale feature extraction and
anomaly map generation. Experimental evaluation on 366 real sensor images
demonstrates $93.8\%$ accuracy on defective samples and $89.3\%$ accuracy on
good samples, with image-level AUROC of 0.957 and pixel-level AUROC of 0.961.
The system provides potential annual cost savings through automated quality
control and processing times of 0.5 seconds per image in on-device

TL;DR: The paper introduces FASTER, a framework for summarizing multimodal financial advisory videos effectively by integrating textual and visual content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge is to extract actionable insights from lengthy, multimodal financial advisory podcast videos, which are typically 30-40 minutes long.

Method: FASTER uses semantic analysis with BLIP, OCR, Whisper-based transcription, and a modified DPO-based loss function for summarization. Keyframes are aligned with text via a ranker mechanism. The study also introduces a dataset, Fin-APT, of 470 financial advisory videos.

Result: FASTER demonstrates strong performance, robustness, and generalizability compared to LLMs and VLMs through cross-domain experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed FASTER framework improves multimodal summarization and makes financial advisory content more interpretable, accessible, and actionable, setting a new benchmark in this field.

Abstract: The dynamic propagation of social media has broadened the reach of financial
advisory content through podcast videos, yet extracting insights from lengthy,
multimodal segments (30-40 minutes) remains challenging. We introduce FASTER
(Financial Advisory Summariser with Textual Embedded Relevant images), a
modular framework that tackles three key challenges: (1) extracting
modality-specific features, (2) producing optimized, concise summaries, and (3)
aligning visual keyframes with associated textual points. FASTER employs BLIP
for semantic visual descriptions, OCR for textual patterns, and Whisper-based
transcription with Speaker diarization as BOS features. A modified Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO)-based loss function, equipped with BOS-specific
fact-checking, ensures precision, relevance, and factual consistency against
the human-aligned summary. A ranker-based retrieval mechanism further aligns
keyframes with summarized content, enhancing interpretability and cross-modal
coherence. To acknowledge data resource scarcity, we introduce Fin-APT, a
dataset comprising 470 publicly accessible financial advisory pep-talk videos
for robust multimodal research. Comprehensive cross-domain experiments confirm
FASTER's strong performance, robustness, and generalizability when compared to
Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By establishing
a new standard for multimodal summarization, FASTER makes financial advisory
content more accessible and actionable, thereby opening new avenues for
research. The dataset and code are available at:

*Yue Duan,Lei Qi,Yinghuan Shi,Yang Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes ASD, an adaptor for deep image clustering that enables cold-start scenarios without pretraining or prerequisites.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep clustering methods integrating Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) demand pretraining or prerequisites, limiting direct application in image clustering tasks.

Method: ASD initializes pseudo-labeled data randomly, uses an instance-level classifier to align instance-level labels, and tracks class transitions to derive cluster-level labels for training an SSL learner.

Result: The ASD approach achieved notable performance on various benchmarks with minimal accuracy drops versus SSL methods using ground-truth labels, such as a 1.33% drop on CIFAR-10.

Conclusion: ASD enhances deep image clustering by removing setup prerequisites, demonstrating adaptability and superior performance while also boosting existing SSL-based methods.

Abstract: Recently, some works integrate SSL techniques into deep clustering frameworks
to enhance image clustering performance. However, they all need pretraining,
clustering learning, or a trained clustering model as prerequisites, limiting
the flexible and out-of-box application of SSL learners in the image clustering
task. This work introduces ASD, an adaptor that enables the cold-start of SSL
learners for deep image clustering without any prerequisites. Specifically, we
first randomly sample pseudo-labeled data from all unlabeled data, and set an
instance-level classifier to learn them with semantically aligned
instance-level labels. With the ability of instance-level classification, we
track the class transitions of predictions on unlabeled data to extract
high-level similarities of instance-level classes, which can be utilized to
assign cluster-level labels to pseudo-labeled data. Finally, we use the
pseudo-labeled data with assigned cluster-level labels to trigger a general SSL
learner trained on the unlabeled data for image clustering. We show the
superior performance of ASD across various benchmarks against the latest deep
image clustering approaches and very slight accuracy gaps compared to SSL
methods using ground-truth, e.g., only 1.33% on CIFAR-10. Moreover, ASD can
also further boost the performance of existing SSL-embedded deep image
clustering methods.

Motivation: The paper aims to address the degrading effects of high-norm artifacts produced by Vision Transformers during knowledge distillation, which hinder student models from harnessing informative signals.

Method: SiNGER introduces nullspace-guided perturbation for efficient teacher feature refinement using a LoRA-based adapter, balancing artifact suppression and signal preservation.

Result: Experiments demonstrate SiNGER’s ability to consistently improve student models, achieving state-of-the-art results in various downstream tasks with clearer and interpretable representations.

Conclusion: SiNGER effectively refines teacher features, advancing distillation techniques to generate high-quality student representations and improve task performance.

Abstract: Vision Transformers are widely adopted as the backbone of vision foundation
models, but they are known to produce high-norm artifacts that degrade
representation quality. When knowledge distillation transfers these features to
students, high-norm artifacts dominate the objective, so students overfit to
artifacts and underweight informative signals, diminishing the gains from
larger models. Prior work attempted to remove artifacts but encountered an
inherent trade-off between artifact suppression and preserving informative
signals from teachers. To address this, we introduce Singular Nullspace-Guided
Energy Reallocation (SiNGER), a novel distillation framework that suppresses
artifacts while preserving informative signals. The key idea is principled
teacher feature refinement: during refinement, we leverage the nullspace-guided
perturbation to preserve information while suppressing artifacts. Then, the
refined teacher's features are distilled to a student. We implement this
perturbation efficiently with a LoRA-based adapter that requires minimal
structural modification. Extensive experiments show that \oursname consistently
improves student models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in multiple
downstream tasks and producing clearer and more interpretable representations.

### [158] [A Single Neuron Works: Precise Concept Erasure in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21008)
*Qinqin He,Jiaqi Weng,Jialing Tao,Hui Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel technique, SNCE, for preventing harmful content generation in text-to-image models using single neuron manipulation, achieving precise concept erasure with minimal impact on image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing concept erasure methods struggle to precisely remove harmful content while maintaining overall image quality.

Method: The authors propose SNCE, which utilizes a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to map text embeddings into a disentangled latent space. Harmful concept neurons are identified through a modulated frequency scoring method and suppressed.

Result: SNCE demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in erasing harmful concepts without degrading the quality of non-target images. It also shows strong robustness against adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: SNCE is a highly effective and precise solution for mitigating safety risks in text-to-image models, ensuring the removal of harmful content while preserving the integrity of other generative capabilities.

Abstract: Text-to-image models exhibit remarkable capabilities in image generation.
However, they also pose safety risks of generating harmful content. A key
challenge of existing concept erasure methods is the precise removal of target
concepts while minimizing degradation of image quality. In this paper, we
propose Single Neuron-based Concept Erasure (SNCE), a novel approach that can
precisely prevent harmful content generation by manipulating only a single
neuron. Specifically, we train a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to map text
embeddings into a sparse, disentangled latent space, where individual neurons
align tightly with atomic semantic concepts. To accurately locate neurons
responsible for harmful concepts, we design a novel neuron identification
method based on the modulated frequency scoring of activation patterns. By
suppressing activations of the harmful concept-specific neuron, SNCE achieves
surgical precision in concept erasure with minimal disruption to image quality.
Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that SNCE achieves
state-of-the-art results in target concept erasure, while preserving the
model's generation capabilities for non-target concepts. Additionally, our
method exhibits strong robustness against adversarial attacks, significantly
outperforming existing methods.

*Andreas Gilson,Lukas Meyer,Oliver Scholz,Ute Schmid*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces KDSS, a resolution-retaining sub-sampling algorithm for plant point cloud segmentation, agnostic to plant species and sensor modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for plant organ segmentation often focus on specific species or sensor modalities and require significant pre-processing, including down-sampling, which loses resolution.

Method: The authors developed KDSS, a lightweight sub-sampling algorithm that retains full-resolution point cloud data and is compatible with existing segmentation models.

Result: KDSS is successful when paired with state-of-the-art segmentation models, showing effective performance across different sensor modalities and plant species.

Conclusion: KDSS is presented as a universal, resolution-retaining alternative for biological point cloud segmentation, reducing the need for intensive pre-processing and down-sampling.

Abstract: Accurate point cloud segmentation for plant organs is crucial for 3D plant
phenotyping. Existing solutions are designed problem-specific with a focus on
certain plant species or specified sensor-modalities for data acquisition.
Furthermore, it is common to use extensive pre-processing and down-sample the
plant point clouds to meet hardware or neural network input size requirements.
We propose a simple, yet effective algorithm KDSS for sub-sampling of
biological point clouds that is agnostic to sensor data and plant species. The
main benefit of this approach is that we do not need to down-sample our input
data and thus, enable segmentation of the full-resolution point cloud.
Combining KD-SS with current state-of-the-art segmentation models shows
satisfying results evaluated on different modalities such as photogrammetry,
laser triangulation and LiDAR for various plant species. We propose KD-SS as
lightweight resolution-retaining alternative to intensive pre-processing and
down-sampling methods for plant organ segmentation regardless of used species
and sensor modality.

### [160] [Background Prompt for Few-Shot Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21055)
*Songyue Cai,Zongqian Wu,Yujie Mo,Liang Peng,Ping Hu,Xiaoshuang Shi,Xiaofeng Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Mambo, a new framework enhancing few-shot out-of-distribution (FS-OOD) detection by improving robustness and addressing limitations in previous foreground-background decomposition methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FG-BG decomposition methods for FS-OOD detection often lack robustness due to excessive reliance on local class similarity and fixed background extraction strategies.

Method: The proposed Mambo framework learns a background prompt to enhance background similarity by combining image semantic information and class similarity. It also uses patch self-calibrated tuning to dynamically determine the number of background patches, addressing the rigidity of previous methods.

Result: Mambo achieves superior performance in FS-OOD detection and near OOD detection compared to state-of-the-art methods, validated through extensive experiments on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Mambo improves FS-OOD detection robustness and flexibility by reducing dependence on local class similarity and enabling adaptive background patch selection, showing promising results on real-world datasets.

Abstract: Existing foreground-background (FG-BG) decomposition methods for the few-shot
out-of-distribution (FS-OOD) detection often suffer from low robustness due to
over-reliance on the local class similarity and a fixed background patch
extraction strategy. To address these challenges, we propose a new FG-BG
decomposition framework, namely Mambo, for FS-OOD detection. Specifically, we
propose to first learn a background prompt to obtain the local background
similarity containing both the background and image semantic information, and
then refine the local background similarity using the local class similarity.
As a result, we use both the refined local background similarity and the local
class similarity to conduct background extraction, reducing the dependence of
the local class similarity in previous methods. Furthermore, we propose the
patch self-calibrated tuning to consider the sample diversity to flexibly
select numbers of background patches for different samples, and thus exploring
the issue of fixed background extraction strategies in previous methods.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed
Mambo achieves the best performance, compared to SOTA methods in terms of OOD
detection and near OOD detection setting. The source code will be released at

*Naga Venkata Sai Jitin Jami,Thomas Altstidl,Jonas Mueller,Jindong Li,Dario Zanca,Bjoern Eskofier,Heike Leutheuser*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes methods to improve dataset splitting for image segmentation tasks, focusing on overcoming issues of label imbalance and class distribution. Two methods, IPS and WDES, are introduced to create better representative splits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Random splitting in image segmentation can result in unrepresentative test sets, leading to biased evaluation and poor generalization. The imbalance in label distribution exacerbates this challenge, necessitating improved sampling strategies.

Method: The authors propose two methods: (1) Iterative Pixel Stratification (IPS), a label-aware sampling approach, and (2) Wasserstein-Driven Evolutionary Stratification (WDES), a genetic algorithm that minimizes Wasserstein distance to achieve optimal label distribution similarity.

Result: WDES outperformed random sampling in producing representative dataset splits, lowering performance variance, and improving model evaluation across various segmentation tasks, including scenarios with small and imbalanced datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed WDES approach is especially effective in addressing label distribution and heterogeneity biases in segmentation datasets, showing its value in both small and diverse data conditions. This leads to fairer evaluation and better model performance.

Abstract: Random splitting of datasets in image segmentation often leads to
unrepresentative test sets, resulting in biased evaluations and poor model
generalization. While stratified sampling has proven effective for addressing
label distribution imbalance in classification tasks, extending these ideas to
segmentation remains challenging due to the multi-label structure and class
imbalance typically present in such data. Building on existing stratification
concepts, we introduce Iterative Pixel Stratification (IPS), a straightforward,
label-aware sampling method tailored for segmentation tasks. Additionally, we
present Wasserstein-Driven Evolutionary Stratification (WDES), a novel genetic
algorithm designed to minimize the Wasserstein distance, thereby optimizing the
similarity of label distributions across dataset splits. We prove that WDES is
globally optimal given enough generations. Using newly proposed statistical
heterogeneity metrics, we evaluate both methods against random sampling and
find that WDES consistently produces more representative splits. Applying WDES
across diverse segmentation tasks, including street scenes, medical imaging,
and satellite imagery, leads to lower performance variance and improved model
evaluation. Our results also highlight the particular value of WDES in handling
small, imbalanced, and low-diversity datasets, where conventional splitting
strategies are most prone to bias.

*Riccardo La Grassa,Ignazio Gallo,Nicola Landro*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces EnGraf-Net, a deep neural network leveraging semantic hierarchies to enhance fine-grained classification without relying on part annotations or cropping techniques, demonstrating superior or competitive performance on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve fine-grained classification by addressing the limitations of part-based methods that fail to represent local features comprehensively and by incorporating semantic associations used by humans.

Method: Introduces EnGraf-Net, a deep neural network that uses hierarchical semantic structures (taxonomy) as supervised signals to enhance performance in fine-grained classification.

Result: Extensive experiments on datasets like CIFAR-100, CUB-200-2011, and FGVC-Aircraft reveal that EnGraf-Net achieves superior or on-par performance compared to recent state-of-the-art models, without requiring traditional manual annotations or cropping techniques.

Conclusion: EnGraf-Net effectively utilizes semantic hierarchies to overcome the limitations of existing classification methods and proves to be an efficient and competitive approach for fine-grained classification tasks.

Abstract: Fine-grained classification models are designed to focus on the relevant
details necessary to distinguish highly similar classes, particularly when
intra-class variance is high and inter-class variance is low. Most existing
models rely on part annotations such as bounding boxes, part locations, or
textual attributes to enhance classification performance, while others employ
sophisticated techniques to automatically extract attention maps. We posit that
part-based approaches, including automatic cropping methods, suffer from an
incomplete representation of local features, which are fundamental for
distinguishing similar objects. While fine-grained classification aims to
recognize the leaves of a hierarchical structure, humans recognize objects by
also forming semantic associations. In this paper, we leverage semantic
associations structured as a hierarchy (taxonomy) as supervised signals within
an end-to-end deep neural network model, termed EnGraf-Net. Extensive
experiments on three well-known datasets CIFAR-100, CUB-200-2011, and
FGVC-Aircraft demonstrate the superiority of EnGraf-Net over many existing
fine-grained models, showing competitive performance with the most recent
state-of-the-art approaches, without requiring cropping techniques or manual
annotations.

*Kasper Cools,Clara Maathuis,Alexander M. van Oers,Claudia S. Hübner,Nikos Deligiannis,Marijke Vandewal,Geert De Cubber*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores the vulnerability of Vision Transformers (ViTs) to adversarial patches, achieving varying attack success rates, and confirms cross-architectural transferability of evasion attacks from CNNs to ViTs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the critical security challenges posed by evasion attacks on modern AI systems, specifically Vision Transformers, which are perceived as more robust than CNNs.

Method: Adversarial patches were crafted using the Creases Transformation (CT) technique to test vulnerabilities in ViTs models, particularly in binary person classification tasks.

Result: The study showed attack success rates ranging between 40.04% and 99.97% across different ViTs, emphasizing the influence of pre-training methodologies and dataset scales on model resilience.

Conclusion: Despite their robustness, ViTs are vulnerable to adversarial patches transferred from CNNs, highlighting the need to address security gaps in machine learning systems.

Abstract: The increasing reliance on machine learning systems has made their security a
critical concern. Evasion attacks enable adversaries to manipulate the
decision-making processes of AI systems, potentially causing security breaches
or misclassification of targets. Vision Transformers (ViTs) have gained
significant traction in modern machine learning due to increased 1) performance
compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and 2) robustness against
adversarial perturbations. However, ViTs remain vulnerable to evasion attacks,
particularly to adversarial patches, unique patterns designed to manipulate AI
classification systems. These vulnerabilities are investigated by designing
realistic adversarial patches to cause misclassification in person vs.
non-person classification tasks using the Creases Transformation (CT)
technique, which adds subtle geometric distortions similar to those occurring
naturally when wearing clothing. This study investigates the transferability of
adversarial attack techniques used in CNNs when applied to ViT classification
models. Experimental evaluation across four fine-tuned ViT models on a binary
person classification task reveals significant vulnerability variations: attack
success rates ranged from 40.04% (google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k) to 99.97%
(facebook/dino-vitb16), with google/vit-base-patch16-224 achieving 66.40% and
facebook/dinov3-vitb16 reaching 65.17%. These results confirm the
cross-architectural transferability of adversarial patches from CNNs to ViTs,
with pre-training dataset scale and methodology strongly influencing model
resilience to adversarial attacks.

*Guojun Lei,Rong Zhang,Chi Wang,Tianhang Liu,Hong Li,Zhiyuan Ma,Weiwei Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UniTransfer, a video concept transfer method that uses spatial and timestep decomposition for precise, controllable editing. Key innovations include a dual-to-single-stream architecture, a self-supervised pretraining strategy, and the Chain-of-Prompt mechanism guided by large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing demand for accurate and manageable video concept transfer requires novel approaches to handle spatial components and denoising processes effectively.

Method: UniTransfer employs spatial decomposition, splitting videos into foreground, background, and motion flow, alongside timestep decomposition using a Chain-of-Prompt method with large language models for progressive stage-specific guidance.

Result: Experiments demonstrate UniTransfer's ability to produce high-quality and editable video transfers, outperforming current benchmarks in terms of visual fidelity and control.

Conclusion: UniTransfer represents a significant advancement in video concept transfer, offering a novel approach for high-quality, detailed, and controllable editing through spatial and diffusion decomposition techniques.

Abstract: We propose a novel architecture UniTransfer, which introduces both spatial
and diffusion timestep decomposition in a progressive paradigm, achieving
precise and controllable video concept transfer. Specifically, in terms of
spatial decomposition, we decouple videos into three key components: the
foreground subject, the background, and the motion flow. Building upon this
decomposed formulation, we further introduce a dual-to-single-stream DiT-based
architecture for supporting fine-grained control over different components in
the videos. We also introduce a self-supervised pretraining strategy based on
random masking to enhance the decomposed representation learning from
large-scale unlabeled video data. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought reasoning
paradigm, we further revisit the denoising diffusion process and propose a
Chain-of-Prompt (CoP) mechanism to achieve the timestep decomposition. We
decompose the denoising process into three stages of different granularity and
leverage large language models (LLMs) for stage-specific instructions to guide
the generation progressively. We also curate an animal-centric video dataset
called OpenAnimal to facilitate the advancement and benchmarking of research in
video concept transfer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
achieves high-quality and controllable video concept transfer across diverse
reference images and scenes, surpassing existing baselines in both visual
fidelity and editability. Web Page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Visual Test-Time Scaling (VTTS), a method to enhance multimodal large language models (MLLMs) reasoning capabilities through iterative perception and hierarchical attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve reasoning in MLLMs by moving beyond static perception and enabling dynamic, iterative focus on visual reasoning tasks.

Method: VTTS uses an Iterative Perception (ITP) mechanism employing reinforcement learning with spatio-temporal supervision. It progressively refines focus on key visual areas guided by updated textual predictions. A corresponding dataset, VTTS-80K, is created to aid iterative perception.

Result: The newly introduced Videochat-R1.5 model showed significant performance gains of over 5% on average across more than 15 benchmarks compared to strong baselines like Qwen2.5VL-3B and -7B.

Conclusion: VTTS effectively improves generalization and reasoning capability in MLLMs through iterative and dynamic attention mechanisms, marking substantial advancements in multimodal perception and understanding.

Abstract: Inducing reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is critical
for achieving human-level perception and understanding. Existing methods mainly
leverage LLM reasoning to analyze parsed visuals, often limited by static
perception stages. This paper introduces Visual Test-Time Scaling (VTTS), a
novel approach to enhance MLLMs' reasoning via iterative perception during
inference. VTTS mimics humans' hierarchical attention by progressively refining
focus on high-confidence spatio-temporal regions, guided by updated textual
predictions. Specifically, VTTS employs an Iterative Perception (ITP)
mechanism, incorporating reinforcement learning with spatio-temporal
supervision to optimize reasoning. To support this paradigm, we also present
VTTS-80K, a dataset tailored for iterative perception. These designs allows a
MLLM to enhance its performance by increasing its perceptual compute. Extensive
experiments validate VTTS's effectiveness and generalization across diverse
tasks and benchmarks. Our newly introduced Videochat-R1.5 model has achieved
remarkable improvements, with an average increase of over 5\%, compared to
robust baselines such as Qwen2.5VL-3B and -7B, across more than 15 benchmarks
that encompass video conversation, video reasoning, and spatio-temporal

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Mammo-CLIP Dissect, a concept-based explainability tool for analyzing what deep learning vision models for mammography learn, focusing on aligning learning with clinical concepts and workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models are widely applied in clinical settings, yet understanding what these models learn—particularly in terms of textual or high-level clinical concepts—is underexplored compared to pixel-based explainability.

Method: The authors develop Mammo-CLIP Dissect, a framework that uses a vision-language model (Mammo-CLIP) to label and quantify neuron-level concept alignments across different vision models under varying datasets and fine-tuning scenarios.

Result: Models trained on mammography datasets more effectively capture clinically relevant concepts, fine-tuning enhances certain specialized concepts but compromises others, highlighting a trade-off between specialization and generalization.

Conclusion: Mammo-CLIP Dissect enhances interpretability of mammography-trained models, shedding light on how domain-specific and task-adaptive training influence concept learning. The tool emphasizes the importance of aligning AI models with clinical reasoning and workflows.

Abstract: Understanding what deep learning (DL) models learn is essential for the safe
deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) in clinical settings. While previous
work has focused on pixel-based explainability methods, less attention has been
paid to the textual concepts learned by these models, which may better reflect
the reasoning used by clinicians. We introduce Mammo-CLIP Dissect, the first
concept-based explainability framework for systematically dissecting DL vision
models trained for mammography. Leveraging a mammography-specific
vision-language model (Mammo-CLIP) as a "dissector," our approach labels
neurons at specified layers with human-interpretable textual concepts and
quantifies their alignment to domain knowledge. Using Mammo-CLIP Dissect, we
investigate three key questions: (1) how concept learning differs between DL
vision models trained on general image datasets versus mammography-specific
datasets; (2) how fine-tuning for downstream mammography tasks affects concept
specialisation; and (3) which mammography-relevant concepts remain
underrepresented. We show that models trained on mammography data capture more
clinically relevant concepts and align more closely with radiologists'
workflows than models not trained on mammography data. Fine-tuning for
task-specific classification enhances the capture of certain concept categories
(e.g., benign calcifications) but can reduce coverage of others (e.g.,
density-related features), indicating a trade-off between specialisation and
generalisation. Our findings show that Mammo-CLIP Dissect provides insights
into how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) capture mammography-specific
knowledge. By comparing models across training data and fine-tuning regimes, we
reveal how domain-specific training and task-specific adaptation shape concept
learning. Code and concept set are available:

TL;DR: The paper introduces MOSS-ChatV, a reinforcement learning framework using Dynamic Time Warping-based rewards to improve video reasoning consistency in multimodal models. It benchmarks its performance on MOSS-Video and achieves promising results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal large language models face challenges in consistently reasoning through video dynamics, which affects interpretability and robustness.

Method: MOSS-ChatV employs a Dynamic Time Warping-based reward system for aligning reasoning traces with temporal references, coupled with dynamic state prediction and process supervision in video benchmarks.

Result: MOSS-ChatV achieves high performance on MOSS-Video test datasets (87.2%) and general video reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating effectiveness across architectures like Qwen2.5-VL and Phi-2.

Conclusion: The framework improves reasoning consistency and robustness for video-based tasks, establishing broad applicability and enhanced interpretability in multimodal models.

Abstract: Video reasoning has emerged as a critical capability for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), requiring models to move beyond static perception
toward coherent understanding of temporal dynamics in complex scenes. Yet
existing MLLMs often exhibit process inconsistency, where intermediate
reasoning drifts from video dynamics even when the final answer is correct,
undermining interpretability and robustness. To address this issue, we
introduce MOSS-ChatV, a reinforcement learning framework with a Dynamic Time
Warping (DTW)-based process reward. This rule-based reward aligns reasoning
traces with temporally grounded references, enabling efficient process
supervision without auxiliary reward models. We further identify dynamic state
prediction as a key measure of video reasoning and construct MOSS-Video, a
benchmark with annotated reasoning traces, where the training split is used to
fine-tune MOSS-ChatV and the held-out split is reserved for evaluation.
MOSS-ChatV achieves 87.2\% on MOSS-Video (test) and improves performance on
general video benchmarks such as MVBench and MMVU. The framework consistently
yields gains across different architectures, including Qwen2.5-VL and Phi-2,
confirming its broad applicability. Evaluations with GPT-4o-as-judge further
show that MOSS-ChatV produces more consistent and stable reasoning traces.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new method to generate videos that consistently follow a camera trajectory, addressing challenges in integrating camera and object motions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with achieving video consistency when both camera and object motions are present, leading to confusion in relative motion handling.

Method: The authors use a stable diffusion network to learn reference motion maps tied to camera trajectories and integrate these with semantic object priors using an image-to-video network.

Result: The proposed method shows significantly better performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in generating consistent videos.

Conclusion: The approach successfully addresses the challenge of combining camera and object motions, achieving higher quality video generation guided by camera trajectories.

Abstract: Generating videos guided by camera trajectories poses significant challenges
in achieving consistency and generalizability, particularly when both camera
and object motions are present. Existing approaches often attempt to learn
these motions separately, which may lead to confusion regarding the relative
motion between the camera and the objects. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel approach that integrates both camera and object motions by
converting them into the motion of corresponding pixels. Utilizing a stable
diffusion network, we effectively learn reference motion maps in relation to
the specified camera trajectory. These maps, along with an extracted semantic
object prior, are then fed into an image-to-video network to generate the
desired video that can accurately follow the designated camera trajectory while
maintaining consistent object motions. Extensive experiments verify that our
model outperforms SOTA methods by a large margin.

TL;DR: This paper examines how data dimensionality and complexity influence a discriminator's ability to distinguish real from synthetic images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the specific conditions under which discriminators are less effective in differentiating synthetic images from real ones.

Method: The study analyzes data dimensionality and complexity using Kolmogorov complexity as a measure. By examining datasets of varying complexity levels, the paper identifies their impact on the performance of discriminators.

Result: High data complexity and very low data complexity both create challenges for discriminators—either due to perfect replication by generators or masking of imperfections. Intermediate-complexity datasets offer the best condition for detection.

Conclusion: Discriminators struggle in low-complexity and high-complexity scenarios, highlighting the importance of dataset complexity in the arms race between image generators and discriminators.

Abstract: The rapid progress of image generative AI has blurred the boundary between
synthetic and real images, fueling an arms race between generators and
discriminators. This paper investigates the conditions under which
discriminators are most disadvantaged in this competition. We analyze two key
factors: data dimensionality and data complexity. While increased
dimensionality often strengthens the discriminators ability to detect subtle
inconsistencies, complexity introduces a more nuanced effect. Using Kolmogorov
complexity as a measure of intrinsic dataset structure, we show that both very
simple and highly complex datasets reduce the detectability of synthetic
images; generators can learn simple datasets almost perfectly, whereas extreme
diversity masks imperfections. In contrast, intermediate-complexity datasets
create the most favorable conditions for detection, as generators fail to fully
capture the distribution and their errors remain visible.

TL;DR: WAVECLIP is a unified model for adaptive resolution inference in CLIP, utilizing wavelet-based tokenization for efficient computation with competitive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to reduce computational overhead in image processing by adapting resolution dynamically within CLIP models.

Method: The approach involves replacing patch embeddings with multi-level wavelet decomposition, utilizing confidence-based gating for adaptive exits, and lightweight distillation from a frozen CLIP teacher.

Result: WAVECLIP achieves competitive accuracy in zero-shot classification with significant computational savings and supports dynamic compute-accuracy trade-offs.

Conclusion: The method provides an efficient and flexible solution for adaptive resolution processing in CLIP models while maintaining high accuracy.

Abstract: We introduce WAVECLIP, a single unified model for adaptive resolution
inference in CLIP, enabled by wavelet-based tokenization. WAVECLIP replaces
standard patch embeddings with a multi-level wavelet decomposition, enabling
the model to process images coarse to fine while naturally supporting multiple
resolutions within the same model. At inference time, the model begins with low
resolution tokens and refines only when needed, using key-value caching and
causal cross-level attention to reuse computation, effectively introducing to
the model only new information when needed. We evaluate WAVECLIP in zero-shot
classification, demonstrating that a simple confidence-based gating mechanism
enables adaptive early exits. This allows users to dynamically choose a
compute-accuracy trade-off using a single deployed model. Our approach requires
only lightweight distillation from a frozen CLIP teacher and achieves
competitive accuracy with significant computational savings.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the impact of quantization on CLIP vision-language models (VLMs), revealing that it affects reliability metrics differently depending on model pre-training, and identifies methods that enhance both efficiency and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses gaps in research regarding the effects of quantization on the performance of VLMs like CLIP, beyond in-distribution accuracy, focusing on computational efficiency and reliability.

Method: The study conducts a large-scale evaluation of quantization effects on CLIP models through reliability metrics like calibration and OOD detection. It also explores specific QAT methods to enhance performance.

Result: Results show that quantization can improve calibration for underconfident models but degrade it for overconfident ones while still improving OOD detection. Specific QAT methods can simultaneously enhance accuracy, calibration, and robustness.

Conclusion: The study challenges the notion of efficiency-performance trade-offs by demonstrating that quantization can optimize multiple objectives in deploying efficient and reliable CLIP-based VLMs.

Abstract: The powerful zero-shot generalization capabilities of vision-language models
(VLMs) like CLIP have enabled new paradigms for safety-related tasks such as
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. However, additional aspects crucial for
the computationally efficient and reliable deployment of CLIP are still
overlooked. In particular, the impact of quantization on CLIP's performance
beyond accuracy remains underexplored. This work presents a large-scale
evaluation of quantization on CLIP models, assessing not only in-distribution
accuracy but a comprehensive suite of reliability metrics and revealing
counterintuitive results driven by pre-training source. We demonstrate that
quantization consistently improves calibration for typically underconfident
pre-trained models, while often degrading it for overconfident variants.
Intriguingly, this degradation in calibration does not preclude gains in other
reliability metrics; we find that OOD detection can still improve for these
same poorly calibrated models. Furthermore, we identify specific
quantization-aware training (QAT) methods that yield simultaneous gains in
zero-shot accuracy, calibration, and OOD robustness, challenging the view of a
strict efficiency-performance trade-off. These findings offer critical insights
for navigating the multi-objective problem of deploying efficient, reliable,
and robust VLMs by utilizing quantization beyond its conventional role.

*Seyed Amir Kasaei,Ali Aghayari,Arash Marioriyad,Niki Sepasian,Shayan Baghayi Nejad,MohammadAmin Fazli,Mahdieh Soleymani Baghshah,Mohammad Hossein Rohban*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CARINOX addresses the challenges of compositional alignment in text-to-image diffusion models by combining noise optimization, exploration, and a principled metric selection correlated with human judgment, outperforming current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models struggle with compositional alignment when generating images from complex prompts, highlighting the need for improved techniques.

Method: CARINOX integrates noise optimization and exploration with a principled reward selection based on human judgment correlations, offering a unified framework.

Result: CARINOX improves alignment scores by +16% on T2I-CompBench++ and +11% on the HRS benchmark while maintaining image quality and diversity.

Conclusion: CARINOX effectively addresses complex compositional challenges in text-to-image diffusion models better than existing optimization or exploration methods.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, can produce
high-quality and diverse images but often fail to achieve compositional
alignment, particularly when prompts describe complex object relationships,
attributes, or spatial arrangements. Recent inference-time approaches address
this by optimizing or exploring the initial noise under the guidance of reward
functions that score text-image alignment without requiring model fine-tuning.
While promising, each strategy has intrinsic limitations when used alone:
optimization can stall due to poor initialization or unfavorable search
trajectories, whereas exploration may require a prohibitively large number of
samples to locate a satisfactory output. Our analysis further shows that
neither single reward metrics nor ad-hoc combinations reliably capture all
aspects of compositionality, leading to weak or inconsistent guidance. To
overcome these challenges, we present Category-Aware Reward-based Initial Noise
Optimization and Exploration (CARINOX), a unified framework that combines noise
optimization and exploration with a principled reward selection procedure
grounded in correlation with human judgments. Evaluations on two complementary
benchmarks covering diverse compositional challenges show that CARINOX raises
average alignment scores by +16% on T2I-CompBench++ and +11% on the HRS
benchmark, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art optimization and
exploration-based methods across all major categories, while preserving image
quality and diversity. The project page is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TABLET, a large-scale dataset with 4 million examples aimed at improving visual table understanding (VTU) tasks by offering paired image-HTML representations, provenance information, and diverse real-world table visualizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VTU benchmarks lack the complexity and diversity of real-world tables and fail to provide access to underlying serialized data for reformulation.

Method: The study creates TABLET, a dataset consisting of 4 million examples covering 20 tasks, preserving original visualizations and providing paired image-HTML representations as well as metadata and provenance details.

Result: Fine-tuning models like Qwen2.5-VL-7B on TABLET enhances performance on both seen and unseen VTU tasks and increases robustness on real-world table visualizations.

Conclusion: TABLET offers a unified dataset to drive robust training and extensible evaluations of VTU models, addressing the shortcomings of existing benchmarks.

Abstract: While table understanding increasingly relies on pixel-only settings where
tables are processed as visual representations, current benchmarks
predominantly use synthetic renderings that lack the complexity and visual
diversity of real-world tables. Additionally, existing visual table
understanding (VTU) datasets offer fixed examples with single visualizations
and pre-defined instructions, providing no access to underlying serialized data
for reformulation. We introduce TABLET, a large-scale VTU dataset with 4
million examples across 20 tasks, grounded in 2 million unique tables where 88%
preserve original visualizations. Each example includes paired image-HTML
representations, comprehensive metadata, and provenance information linking
back to the source datasets. Fine-tuning vision-language models like
Qwen2.5-VL-7B on TABLET improves performance on seen and unseen VTU tasks while
increasing robustness on real-world table visualizations. By preserving
original visualizations and maintaining example traceability in a unified
large-scale collection, TABLET establishes a foundation for robust training and
extensible evaluation of future VTU models.

*Amr Alkhatib,Stephanie Lowry*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a conformal prediction-based approach to improve the fidelity and robustness of feature attribution methods used for explaining image-based predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional feature attribution methods vary in robustness and may not accurately reflect the model’s reasoning; users lack control over the explanation fidelity.

Method: The approach identifies salient features sufficient to keep the model’s prediction intact, using four conformity measures without requiring ground-truth explanations.

Result: Empirical results show superior performance of FastSHAP over competing methods in fidelity and informational efficiency across various datasets and explainers.

Conclusion: Conformity measures based on super-pixels are more effective, enabling improved and efficient explanations for image-based predictions.

Abstract: Feature attribution methods are widely used for explaining image-based
predictions, as they provide feature-level insights that can be intuitively
visualized. However, such explanations often vary in their robustness and may
fail to faithfully reflect the reasoning of the underlying black-box model. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel conformal prediction-based
approach that enables users to directly control the fidelity of the generated
explanations. The method identifies a subset of salient features that is
sufficient to preserve the model's prediction, regardless of the information
carried by the excluded features, and without demanding access to ground-truth
explanations for calibration. Four conformity functions are proposed to
quantify the extent to which explanations conform to the model's predictions.
The approach is empirically evaluated using five explainers across six image
datasets. The empirical results demonstrate that FastSHAP consistently
outperforms the competing methods in terms of both fidelity and informational
efficiency, the latter measured by the size of the explanation regions.
Furthermore, the results reveal that conformity measures based on super-pixels
are more effective than their pixel-wise counterparts.

*Muxin Pu,Mei Kuan Lim,Chun Yong Chong,Chen Change Loy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Sigma, a skeleton-based SLU framework addressing limitations in semantic grounding, detail-context balance, and cross-modal learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges of weak semantic understanding, imbalance of local-global context focus, and inefficient cross-modal learning in current skeleton-based SLU methods.

Method: Sigma uses sign-aware early fusion for visual-textual interaction, hierarchical alignment to capture details and semantics, and a unified pre-training strategy incorporating contrastive learning, text matching, and language modeling.

Result: Sigma achieves state-of-the-art performance in tasks like isolated/continuous sign language recognition and gloss-free sign language translation across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the effectiveness of skeletal data and semantically rich pre-training for advancing SLU performance.

Abstract: Pre-training has proven effective for learning transferable features in sign
language understanding (SLU) tasks. Recently, skeleton-based methods have
gained increasing attention because they can robustly handle variations in
subjects and backgrounds without being affected by appearance or environmental
factors. Current SLU methods continue to face three key limitations: 1) weak
semantic grounding, as models often capture low-level motion patterns from
skeletal data but struggle to relate them to linguistic meaning; 2) imbalance
between local details and global context, with models either focusing too
narrowly on fine-grained cues or overlooking them for broader context; and 3)
inefficient cross-modal learning, as constructing semantically aligned
representations across modalities remains difficult. To address these, we
propose Sigma, a unified skeleton-based SLU framework featuring: 1) a
sign-aware early fusion mechanism that facilitates deep interaction between
visual and textual modalities, enriching visual features with linguistic
context; 2) a hierarchical alignment learning strategy that jointly maximises
agreements across different levels of paired features from different
modalities, effectively capturing both fine-grained details and high-level
semantic relationships; and 3) a unified pre-training framework that combines
contrastive learning, text matching and language modelling to promote semantic
consistency and generalisation. Sigma achieves new state-of-the-art results on
isolated sign language recognition, continuous sign language recognition, and
gloss-free sign language translation on multiple benchmarks spanning different
sign and spoken languages, demonstrating the impact of semantically informative
pre-training and the effectiveness of skeletal data as a stand-alone solution
for SLU.

*Seyed Amir Kasaei,Ali Aghayari,Arash Marioriyad,Niki Sepasian,MohammadAmin Fazli,Mahdieh Soleymani Baghshah,Mohammad Hossein Rohban*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study critically evaluates metrics used in text-image generation, finding no metric consistently aligns with human judgment and urging careful metric selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to understand how well commonly used metrics in text-image generation reflect human preferences, as these directly impact evaluation and reported progress.

Method: Conducted a broad analysis of widely used metrics, comparing their alignment with human judgments across various compositional challenges.

Result: No single metric performed consistently across tasks; VQA-based metrics were not universally superior, and embedding-based metrics excelled in specific cases.

Conclusion: Careful and transparent selection of metrics is crucial for trustworthy evaluation of text-image generation outputs.

Abstract: Text-image generation has advanced rapidly, but assessing whether outputs
truly capture the objects, attributes, and relations described in prompts
remains a central challenge. Evaluation in this space relies heavily on
automated metrics, yet these are often adopted by convention or popularity
rather than validated against human judgment. Because evaluation and reported
progress in the field depend directly on these metrics, it is critical to
understand how well they reflect human preferences. To address this, we present
a broad study of widely used metrics for compositional text-image evaluation.
Our analysis goes beyond simple correlation, examining their behavior across
diverse compositional challenges and comparing how different metric families
align with human judgments. The results show that no single metric performs
consistently across tasks: performance varies with the type of compositional
problem. Notably, VQA-based metrics, though popular, are not uniformly
superior, while certain embedding-based metrics prove stronger in specific
cases. Image-only metrics, as expected, contribute little to compositional
evaluation, as they are designed for perceptual quality rather than alignment.
These findings underscore the importance of careful and transparent metric
selection, both for trustworthy evaluation and for their use as reward models
in generation. Project page is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SlideMamba, a deep learning framework combining Mamba architecture and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for improved Whole Slide Image (WSI) analysis, achieving superior performance on gene fusion and mutation prediction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a robust computational pathology framework that effectively captures both local spatial relationships and long-range contextual dependencies from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) for enhanced analysis and predictive tasks.

Method: The study integrates Mamba architecture and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with an entropy-based adaptive fusion strategy, dynamically balancing local and global information for WSI analysis.

Result: The proposed SlideMamba framework achieved a PRAUC of 0.751, outperforming existing methods including MIL, Trans-MIL, Mamba-only, and GNN-only across various metrics like ROC AUC, sensitivity, and specificity.

Conclusion: SlideMamba's integrated architecture and adaptive fusion strategy demonstrate strong potential for scalable and context-aware predictive modeling in computational pathology, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Advances in computational pathology increasingly rely on extracting
meaningful representations from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) to support various
clinical and biological tasks. In this study, we propose a generalizable deep
learning framework that integrates the Mamba architecture with Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) for enhanced WSI analysis. Our method is designed to capture
both local spatial relationships and long-range contextual dependencies,
offering a flexible architecture for digital pathology analysis. Mamba modules
excels in capturing long-range global dependencies, while GNNs emphasize
fine-grained short-range spatial interactions. To effectively combine these
complementary signals, we introduce an adaptive fusion strategy that uses an
entropy-based confidence weighting mechanism. This approach dynamically
balances contributions from both branches by assigning higher weight to the
branch with more confident (lower-entropy) predictions, depending on the
contextual importance of local versus global information for different
downstream tasks. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on a
representative task: predicting gene fusion and mutation status from WSIs. Our
framework, SlideMamba, achieves an area under the precision recall curve
(PRAUC) of 0.751 \pm 0.05, outperforming MIL (0.491 \pm 0.042), Trans-MIL (0.39
\pm 0.017), Mamba-only (0.664 \pm 0.063), GNN-only (0.748 \pm 0.091), and a
prior similar work GAT-Mamba (0.703 \pm 0.075). SlideMamba also achieves
competitive results across ROC AUC (0.738 \pm 0.055), sensitivity (0.662 \pm
0.083), and specificity (0.725 \pm 0.094). These results highlight the strength
of the integrated architecture, enhanced by the proposed entropy-based adaptive
fusion strategy, and suggest promising potential for application of
spatially-resolved predictive modeling tasks in computational pathology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents Hunyuan3D-Omni, a unified framework for fine-grained 3D asset generation with multi-modal controls, including image, point clouds, voxels, bounding boxes, and skeletal pose signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations in existing 3D generative models, which primarily use text or image conditioning and lack fine-grained, cross-modal controls, hindering their practical utility and controllability.

Method: The method involves a unified cross-modal architecture that integrates various conditioning signals and utilizes a progressive, difficulty-aware sampling strategy to encourage robust multi-modal fusion and successful handling of missing inputs.

Result: Results demonstrate improved generation accuracy, geometry-aware transformations, and increased robustness, making the system more suitable for production workflows.

Conclusion: Hunyuan3D-Omni enhances control, accuracy, and robustness for 3D asset generation, addressing gaps in existing methods and advancing practical adoption in production environments.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D-native generative models have accelerated asset
creation for games, film, and design. However, most methods still rely
primarily on image or text conditioning and lack fine-grained, cross-modal
controls, which limits controllability and practical adoption. To address this
gap, we present Hunyuan3D-Omni, a unified framework for fine-grained,
controllable 3D asset generation built on Hunyuan3D 2.1. In addition to images,
Hunyuan3D-Omni accepts point clouds, voxels, bounding boxes, and skeletal pose
priors as conditioning signals, enabling precise control over geometry,
topology, and pose. Instead of separate heads for each modality, our model
unifies all signals in a single cross-modal architecture. We train with a
progressive, difficulty-aware sampling strategy that selects one control
modality per example and biases sampling toward harder signals (e.g., skeletal
pose) while downweighting easier ones (e.g., point clouds), encouraging robust
multi-modal fusion and graceful handling of missing inputs. Experiments show
that these additional controls improve generation accuracy, enable
geometry-aware transformations, and increase robustness for production
workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address the issue of CNNs exploiting superficial correlations in data, which undermines their reliability for making predictions, and to provide a scalable solution for guiding model attention without dependent on labor-intensive annotations.

Method: The authors propose a method where vision-language models automatically generate semantic attention maps based on natural language prompts. An auxiliary loss aligns CNN attention with these maps to promote cognitively plausible decision-making without manual labeling.

Result: The proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on ColorMNIST and performs competitively on DecoyMNIST when compared to methods utilizing annotation-heavy baselines.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates improved generalization, reduced shortcut reliance, and aligns CNN attention with human intuitive reasoning, achieving competitive results while eliminating the need for labor-intensive annotations.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) frequently "cheat" by exploiting
superficial correlations, raising concerns about whether they make predictions
for the right reasons. Inspired by cognitive science, which highlights the role
of attention in robust human perception, recent methods have sought to guide
model attention using concept-based supervision and explanation regularization.
However, these techniques depend on labor-intensive, expert-provided
annotations, limiting their scalability. We propose a scalable framework that
leverages vision-language models to automatically generate semantic attention
maps using natural language prompts. By introducing an auxiliary loss that
aligns CNN attention with these language-guided maps, our approach promotes
more reliable and cognitively plausible decision-making without manual
annotation. Experiments on challenging datasets, ColoredMNIST and DecoyMNIST,
show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on ColorMNIST and
remains competitive with annotation-heavy baselines on DecoyMNIST,
demonstrating improved generalization, reduced shortcut reliance, and model
attention that better reflects human intuition.

Conclusion: Decipher-MR establishes itself as a scalable and generalizable foundation model for MRI analysis, enabling efficient and versatile development in clinical and research settings.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a critical medical imaging modality in
clinical diagnosis and research, yet its complexity and heterogeneity pose
challenges for automated analysis, particularly in scalable and generalizable
machine learning applications. While foundation models have revolutionized
natural language and vision tasks, their application to MRI remains limited due
to data scarcity and narrow anatomical focus. In this work, we present

spanning diverse anatomical regions, sequences, and pathologies. Decipher-MR
integrates self-supervised vision learning with report-guided text supervision
to build robust, generalizable representations, enabling effective adaptation
across broad applications. To enable robust and diverse clinical tasks with
minimal computational overhead, Decipher-MR supports a modular design that
enables tuning of lightweight, task-specific decoders attached to a frozen

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models struggle with multi-step reasoning tasks and face limitations such as inaccessible internal mechanisms and inability to interpret fine-grained visual content.

Method: SQ-InstructBLIP employs three components—Questioner, Answerer, and Reasoner—that collaboratively generate informative sub-questions and answers, leveraging visual information for reasoning on VQA tasks.

Result: Experiments reveal that SQ-InstructBLIP outperforms prior models in reasoning accuracy by using image-aware sub-questions.

Conclusion: SQ-InstructBLIP effectively addresses the reasoning challenges in VQA tasks, offering a more interpretable and accurate approach compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: The field of vision-language understanding has been actively researched in
recent years, thanks to the development of Large Language Models~(LLMs).
However, it still needs help with problems requiring multi-step reasoning, even
for very simple questions. Recent studies adopt LLMs to tackle this problem by
iteratively generating sub-questions and answers. However, there are
disadvantages such as 1) the fine-grained visual contents of images are not
available using LLMs that cannot read visual information, 2) internal
mechanisms are inaccessible and difficult to reproduce by using black-box LLMs.
To solve these problems, we propose the SQ (Self-Questioning)-InstructBLIP,
which improves inference performance by generating image-aware informative
sub-questions and sub-answers iteratively. The SQ-InstructBLIP, which consists
of a Questioner, Answerer, and Reasoner that share the same architecture.
Questioner and Answerer generate sub-questions and sub-answers to help infer
the main-question, and Reasoner performs reasoning on the main-question
considering the generated sub-question information. Our experiments show that
the proposed method SQ-InstructBLIP, which uses the generated sub-questions as
additional information when solving the VQA task, performs more accurate
reasoning than the previous works.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper defines hallucination for text-to-image (T2I) generative models and proposes a taxonomy for evaluating bias-driven deviations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify and systematically study hallucinations in T2I models, which have been overlooked compared to language and vision-language models.

Method: The authors propose a taxonomy with three categories of hallucinations: attribute, relation, and object, to assess T2I models.

Result: The taxonomy establishes an upper bound for evaluation and reveals hidden biases in T2I generative models.

Conclusion: The study offers a foundation for more comprehensive assessment of T2I models, improving understanding of their hallucination implications.

Abstract: In language and vision-language models, hallucination is broadly understood
as content generated from a model's prior knowledge or biases rather than from
the given input. While this phenomenon has been studied in those domains, it
has not been clearly framed for text-to-image (T2I) generative models. Existing
evaluations mainly focus on alignment, checking whether prompt-specified
elements appear, but overlook what the model generates beyond the prompt. We
argue for defining hallucination in T2I as bias-driven deviations and propose a
taxonomy with three categories: attribute, relation, and object hallucinations.
This framing introduces an upper bound for evaluation and surfaces hidden
biases, providing a foundation for richer assessment of T2I models.

*Feng-Qi Cui,Jinyang Huang,Anyang Tong,Ziyu Jia,Jie Zhang,Zhi Liu,Dan Guo,Jianwei Lu,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework to improve micro-action recognition, particularly addressing the challenge of inter-person variability in real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with inter-person variability, where the same micro-action manifests differently across individuals, hindering robust generalization.

Method: The proposed framework uses Distributionally Robust Optimization principles to create person-agnostic representations. It includes two components: a feature-level Temporal-Frequency Alignment Module for stabilizing trajectories and addressing spectral differences, and a loss-level Group-Invariant Regularized Loss to handle person-specific distributions.

Result: Experiments conducted on the MA-52 dataset show that the framework outperforms current methods in terms of accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enhances micro-action recognition, offering stable generalization in fine-grained and challenging conditions.

Abstract: Micro-action Recognition is vital for psychological assessment and
human-computer interaction. However, existing methods often fail in real-world
scenarios because inter-person variability causes the same action to manifest
differently, hindering robust generalization. To address this, we propose the
Person Independence Universal Micro-action Recognition Framework, which
integrates Distributionally Robust Optimization principles to learn
person-agnostic representations. Our framework contains two plug-and-play
components operating at the feature and loss levels. At the feature level, the
Temporal-Frequency Alignment Module normalizes person-specific motion
characteristics with a dual-branch design: the temporal branch applies
Wasserstein-regularized alignment to stabilize dynamic trajectories, while the
frequency branch introduces variance-guided perturbations to enhance robustness
against person-specific spectral differences. A consistency-driven fusion
mechanism integrates both branches. At the loss level, the Group-Invariant
Regularized Loss partitions samples into pseudo-groups to simulate unseen
person-specific distributions. By up-weighting boundary cases and regularizing
subgroup variance, it forces the model to generalize beyond easy or frequent
samples, thus enhancing robustness to difficult variations. Experiments on the
large-scale MA-52 dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing
methods in both accuracy and robustness, achieving stable generalization under
fine-grained conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses limitations of current semantic matching methods, proposing a modified VGGT model for geometry-aware dense pixel matching with improved manifold preservation, showcasing superior performance over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation comes from the necessity to address challenges like geometric ambiguity and pixel-wise nearest-neighbor matching in semantic matching scenarios within computer vision.

Method: The method involves adapting VGGT features for semantic matching by fine-tuning certain layers, adding a semantic head, and leveraging strategies like cycle-consistent training, synthetic data augmentation, and progressive training to mitigate data scarcity issues.

Result: Experiments show superior performance in geometry awareness, pixel matching reliability, and manifold preservation compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully repurposes VGGT for semantic matching tasks, overcoming geometric ambiguity and enhancing reliability and generalization.

Abstract: Semantic matching aims to establish pixel-level correspondences between
instances of the same category and represents a fundamental task in computer
vision. Existing approaches suffer from two limitations: (i) Geometric
Ambiguity: Their reliance on 2D foundation model features (e.g., Stable
Diffusion, DINO) often fails to disambiguate symmetric structures, requiring
extra fine-tuning yet lacking generalization; (ii) Nearest-Neighbor Rule: Their
pixel-wise matching ignores cross-image invisibility and neglects manifold
preservation. These challenges call for geometry-aware pixel descriptors and
holistic dense correspondence mechanisms. Inspired by recent advances in 3D
geometric foundation models, we turn to VGGT, which provides geometry-grounded
features and holistic dense matching capabilities well aligned with these
needs. However, directly transferring VGGT is challenging, as it was originally
designed for geometry matching within cross views of a single instance,
misaligned with cross-instance semantic matching, and further hindered by the
scarcity of dense semantic annotations. To address this, we propose an approach
that (i) retains VGGT's intrinsic strengths by reusing early feature stages,
fine-tuning later ones, and adding a semantic head for bidirectional
correspondences; and (ii) adapts VGGT to the semantic matching scenario under
data scarcity through cycle-consistent training strategy, synthetic data
augmentation, and progressive training recipe with aliasing artifact
mitigation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
superior geometry awareness, matching reliability, and manifold preservation,
outperforming previous baselines.

Result: Experiments on four medical datasets demonstrate MedVSR's superior reconstruction performance and efficiency compared to existing models.

Conclusion: MedVSR effectively tackles challenges in medical video super-resolution, improving clinical utility for diagnoses.

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) medical videos are vital for accurate diagnosis, yet are
hard to acquire due to hardware limitations and physiological constraints.
Clinically, the collected low-resolution (LR) medical videos present unique
challenges for video super-resolution (VSR) models, including camera shake,
noise, and abrupt frame transitions, which result in significant optical flow
errors and alignment difficulties. Additionally, tissues and organs exhibit
continuous and nuanced structures, but current VSR models are prone to
introducing artifacts and distorted features that can mislead doctors. To this
end, we propose MedVSR, a tailored framework for medical VSR. It first employs
Cross State-Space Propagation (CSSP) to address the imprecise alignment by
projecting distant frames as control matrices within state-space models,
enabling the selective propagation of consistent and informative features to
neighboring frames for effective alignment. Moreover, we design an Inner
State-Space Reconstruction (ISSR) module that enhances tissue structures and
reduces artifacts with joint long-range spatial feature learning and
large-kernel short-range information aggregation. Experiments across four
datasets in diverse medical scenarios, including endoscopy and cataract
surgeries, show that MedVSR significantly outperforms existing VSR models in
reconstruction performance and efficiency. Code released at

### [186] [MMR1: Enhancing Multimodal Reasoning with Variance-Aware Sampling and Open Resources](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21268)
*Sicong Leng,Jing Wang,Jiaxi Li,Hao Zhang,Zhiqiang Hu,Boqiang Zhang,Yuming Jiang,Hang Zhang,Xin Li,Lidong Bing,Deli Zhao,Wei Lu,Yu Rong,Aixin Sun,Shijian Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses limitations in multimodal reasoning models, particularly the lack of high-quality long chain-of-thought data and RL instability. It introduces Variance-Aware Sampling (VAS), releases large datasets, and open-sources reasoning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome major constraints in multimodal reasoning models: insufficient quality data for chain-of-thought reasoning and reinforcement learning instability in fine-tuning.

Method: Variance-Aware Sampling (VAS) uses VPS to select diverse and high-reward-variance data, thereby stabilizing policy optimization. The work also provides curated datasets and open-source models.

Result: Experiments and benchmarks show improved performance and stability in multimodal mathematical reasoning tasks, supported by ablation and theoretical studies.

Conclusion: By addressing data quality and RL stability, the paper provides valuable tools, insights, and standardized baselines to advance the field of multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Large multimodal reasoning models have achieved rapid progress, but their
advancement is constrained by two major limitations: the absence of open,
large-scale, high-quality long chain-of-thought (CoT) data, and the instability
of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in post-training. Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO), the standard framework for RL fine-tuning, is prone
to gradient vanishing when reward variance is low, which weakens optimization
signals and impairs convergence. This work makes three contributions: (1) We
propose Variance-Aware Sampling (VAS), a data selection strategy guided by
Variance Promotion Score (VPS) that combines outcome variance and trajectory
diversity to promote reward variance and stabilize policy optimization. (2) We
release large-scale, carefully curated resources containing ~1.6M long CoT
cold-start data and ~15k RL QA pairs, designed to ensure quality, difficulty,
and diversity, along with a fully reproducible end-to-end training codebase.
(3) We open-source a family of multimodal reasoning models in multiple scales,
establishing standardized baselines for the community. Experiments across
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of both the
curated data and the proposed VAS. Comprehensive ablation studies and analyses
provide further insight into the contributions of each component. In addition,
we theoretically establish that reward variance lower-bounds the expected
policy gradient magnitude, with VAS serving as a practical mechanism to realize
this guarantee. Our code, data, and checkpoints are available at

TL;DR: This study presents the Prithvi-EO Vision Transformer foundation model, pre-trained on Sentinel-3 OLCI data for marine earth observation tasks, yielding promising results in ocean monitoring and climate studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of limited labeled data in ocean science, particularly for applications like chlorophyll concentration quantification and remote sensing-based estimates of ocean primary production.

Method: Development and pre-training of the Prithvi-EO Vision Transformer foundation model on Sentinel-3 OLCI data and fine-tuning it for specific marine earth observation tasks.

Result: The model outperformed current baseline approaches in capturing ocean color's spatial patterns and analyzing primary production, demonstrating effectiveness with minimal high-quality labeled data.

Conclusion: Geospatial AI models like Prithvi-EO can provide robust insights into ocean ecosystems, aiding in understanding their global climate impacts.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) Foundation models (FMs), pre-trained on massive
unlabelled datasets, have the potential to drastically change AI applications
in ocean science, where labelled data are often sparse and expensive to
collect. In this work, we describe a new foundation model using the Prithvi-EO
Vision Transformer architecture which has been pre-trained to reconstruct data
from the Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI). We evaluate the
model by fine-tuning on two downstream marine earth observation tasks. We first
assess model performance compared to current baseline models used to quantify
chlorophyll concentration. We then evaluate the FMs ability to refine remote
sensing-based estimates of ocean primary production. Our results demonstrate
the utility of self-trained FMs for marine monitoring, in particular for making
use of small amounts of high quality labelled data and in capturing detailed
spatial patterns of ocean colour whilst matching point observations. We
conclude that this new generation of geospatial AI models has the potential to
provide more robust, data-driven insights into ocean ecosystems and their role
in global climate processes.

*Shilin Lu,Zhuming Lian,Zihan Zhou,Shaocong Zhang,Chen Zhao,Adams Wai-Kin Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SHINE, a framework for seamless and high-quality object insertion into images, overcoming challenges like complex lighting and high-resolution diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models struggle with accurate image composition in challenging scenarios such as complex lighting and intricate visual elements. Modern diffusion models have potential, but their limitations hinder practical application.

Method: SHINE uses manifold-steered anchor loss, degradation-suppression guidance, and adaptive background blending without relying on training. It leverages pretrained adapters for subject representation while ensuring background fidelity.

Result: SHINE achieves state-of-the-art results on both standard and human-aligned metrics using the proposed ComplexCompo benchmark to evaluate performance under challenging conditions.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates significant improvement in seamless image composition, addressing limitations of diffusion models. Code and benchmarks will be publicly available to advance research in this field.

Abstract: Image composition aims to seamlessly insert a user-specified object into a
new scene, but existing models struggle with complex lighting (e.g., accurate
shadows, water reflections) and diverse, high-resolution inputs. Modern
text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX) already encode essential
physical and resolution priors, yet lack a framework to unleash them without
resorting to latent inversion, which often locks object poses into contextually
inappropriate orientations, or brittle attention surgery. We propose SHINE, a
training-free framework for Seamless, High-fidelity Insertion with Neutralized
Errors. SHINE introduces manifold-steered anchor loss, leveraging pretrained
customization adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to guide latents for faithful subject
representation while preserving background integrity. Degradation-suppression
guidance and adaptive background blending are proposed to further eliminate
low-quality outputs and visible seams. To address the lack of rigorous
benchmarks, we introduce ComplexCompo, featuring diverse resolutions and
challenging conditions such as low lighting, strong illumination, intricate
shadows, and reflective surfaces. Experiments on ComplexCompo and
DreamEditBench show state-of-the-art performance on standard metrics (e.g.,
DINOv2) and human-aligned scores (e.g., DreamSim, ImageReward, VisionReward).
Code and benchmark will be publicly available upon publication.

### [189] [Quantized Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21302)
*Weilun Feng,Haotong Qin,Mingqiang Wu,Chuanguang Yang,Yuqi Li,Xiangqi Li,Zhulin An,Libo Huang,Yulun Zhang,Michele Magno,Yongjun Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces QuantVGGT, a framework for quantizing Visual Geometry Grounded Transformers (VGGTs) to address their computational and memory inefficiencies without sacrificing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the remarkable advancements made by VGGTs in 3D reconstruction tasks, their vast computational and memory demands pose challenges for real-world deployment. Standard Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) methods struggle to address these issues effectively due to unique challenges such as heavy-tailed activation distributions caused by special tokens and instability in calibration sample selection from multi-view data.

Method: QuantVGGT introduces two key techniques: (1) Dual-Smoothed Fine-Grained Quantization, combining global Hadamard rotation and local channel smoothing to handle activation distribution challenges; and (2) Noise-Filtered Diverse Sampling, leveraging deep-layer statistics and diverse calibration clusters to stabilize quantization ranges.

Result: Experiments prove that QuantVGGT sets a new standard in various benchmarks and bit-widths, outperforming generic quantization methods significantly. Specifically, its 4-bit implementation achieves 3.7× memory reduction and 2.5× acceleration on real hardware, while maintaining over 98% reconstruction accuracy.

Conclusion: QuantVGGT addresses the limitations of standard PTQ methods for VGGTs, offering an effective solution for deploying VGGTs in resource-constrained environments while preserving performance. The framework demonstrates significant memory savings, computational acceleration, and accuracy retention.

Abstract: Learning-based 3D reconstruction models, represented by Visual Geometry
Grounded Transformers (VGGTs), have made remarkable progress with the use of
large-scale transformers. Their prohibitive computational and memory costs
severely hinder real-world deployment. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) has
become a common practice for compressing and accelerating models. However, we
empirically observe that PTQ faces unique obstacles when compressing
billion-scale VGGTs: the data-independent special tokens induce heavy-tailed
activation distributions, while the multi-view nature of 3D data makes
calibration sample selection highly unstable. This paper proposes the first
Quantization framework for VGGTs, namely QuantVGGT. This mainly relies on two
technical contributions: First, we introduce Dual-Smoothed Fine-Grained
Quantization, which integrates pre-global Hadamard rotation and post-local
channel smoothing to mitigate heavy-tailed distributions and inter-channel
variance robustly. Second, we design Noise-Filtered Diverse Sampling, which
filters outliers via deep-layer statistics and constructs frame-aware diverse
calibration clusters to ensure stable quantization ranges. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that QuantVGGT achieves the state-of-the-art results
across different benchmarks and bit-width, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art generic quantization method with a great margin. We highlight
that our 4-bit QuantVGGT can deliver a 3.7$\times$ memory reduction and
2.5$\times$ acceleration in real-hardware inference, while maintaining
reconstruction accuracy above 98\% of its full-precision counterpart. This
demonstrates the vast advantages and practicality of QuantVGGT in
resource-constrained scenarios. Our code is released in

TL;DR: NewtonGen addresses the lack of physical consistency and controllability in text-to-video generation by integrating Neural Newtonian Dynamics (NND) for better motion realism and parameter precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models for text-to-video generation struggle with unrealistic motions and lack precise control due to an absence of understanding of physical dynamics.

Method: NewtonGen incorporates trainable Neural Newtonian Dynamics (NND) to model Newtonian motions, injecting physical constraints and combining data-driven synthesis with dynamical guidance.

Result: NewtonGen successfully generates videos with physically consistent dynamics and allows precise control over parameters.

Conclusion: Integrating physical principles into video generation models improves both realism and controllability, addressing key limitations in state-of-the-art text-to-video frameworks.

Abstract: A primary bottleneck in large-scale text-to-video generation today is
physical consistency and controllability. Despite recent advances,
state-of-the-art models often produce unrealistic motions, such as objects
falling upward, or abrupt changes in velocity and direction. Moreover, these
models lack precise parameter control, struggling to generate physically
consistent dynamics under different initial conditions. We argue that this
fundamental limitation stems from current models learning motion distributions
solely from appearance, while lacking an understanding of the underlying
dynamics. In this work, we propose NewtonGen, a framework that integrates
data-driven synthesis with learnable physical principles. At its core lies
trainable Neural Newtonian Dynamics (NND), which can model and predict a
variety of Newtonian motions, thereby injecting latent dynamical constraints
into the video generation process. By jointly leveraging data priors and
dynamical guidance, NewtonGen enables physically consistent video synthesis
with precise parameter control.

Motivation: Current advanced image generation models are computationally demanding, limiting accessibility for consumer-level hardware.

Method: The framework integrates a refined distribution matching objective, innovations like “timestep sharing” and “split-timestep fine-tuning,” along with pipeline optimizations such as text encoder restructuring and quantization.

Result: SD3.5-Flash achieves improved performance, prompt alignment, and memory efficiency, enabling reliable deployment even on devices like mobile phones.

Conclusion: This work democratizes high-quality image generation, offering a practical and efficient generative AI accessible across varied hardware.

Abstract: We present SD3.5-Flash, an efficient few-step distillation framework that
brings high-quality image generation to accessible consumer devices. Our
approach distills computationally prohibitive rectified flow models through a
reformulated distribution matching objective tailored specifically for few-step
generation. We introduce two key innovations: "timestep sharing" to reduce
gradient noise and "split-timestep fine-tuning" to improve prompt alignment.
Combined with comprehensive pipeline optimizations like text encoder
restructuring and specialized quantization, our system enables both rapid
generation and memory-efficient deployment across different hardware
configurations. This democratizes access across the full spectrum of devices,
from mobile phones to desktop computers. Through extensive evaluation including
large-scale user studies, we demonstrate that SD3.5-Flash consistently
outperforms existing few-step methods, making advanced generative AI truly
accessible for practical deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in the governance and quality of publicly available medical imaging datasets used to train and validate healthcare AI algorithms.

Method: The paper conducts an analysis comparing publicly available medical imaging and computer vision datasets across dimensions such as data sharing, documentation, and maintenance.

Result: The analysis reveals issues like vague licensing, lack of persistent identifiers, duplicates, missing metadata, and deficiencies in dataset governance practices.

Conclusion: There is a need for improved data curation, documentation, and maintenance practices to mitigate potential harmful effects and ensure responsibility in AI for healthcare.

Abstract: Medical Imaging (MI) datasets are fundamental to artificial intelligence in
healthcare. The accuracy, robustness, and fairness of diagnostic algorithms
depend on the data (and its quality) used to train and evaluate the models. MI
datasets used to be proprietary, but have become increasingly available to the
public, including on community-contributed platforms (CCPs) like Kaggle or
HuggingFace. While open data is important to enhance the redistribution of
data's public value, we find that the current CCP governance model fails to
uphold the quality needed and recommended practices for sharing, documenting,
and evaluating datasets. In this paper, we conduct an analysis of publicly
available machine learning datasets on CCPs, discussing datasets' context, and
identifying limitations and gaps in the current CCP landscape. We highlight
differences between MI and computer vision datasets, particularly in the
potentially harmful downstream effects from poor adoption of recommended
dataset management practices. We compare the analyzed datasets across several
dimensions, including data sharing, data documentation, and maintenance. We
find vague licenses, lack of persistent identifiers and storage, duplicates,
and missing metadata, with differences between the platforms. Our research
contributes to efforts in responsible data curation and AI algorithms for
healthcare.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: FZModules introduces a framework for designing asynchronous error-bounded compression pipelines, combining GPU throughput with tailored compression performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern scientific applications generate vast data beyond storage and memory capacity, creating a need for controlled-error compression methods to manage scalability.

Method: The paper proposes FZModules, a modular framework leveraging heterogeneous compression pipelines, asynchronous task execution, and dependency management.

Result: Tests on scientific datasets showed FZModules achieves speed comparability to GPU compressors while maintaining high rate-distortion performance.

Conclusion: FZModules facilitates rapid design of efficient, domain-specific compression pipelines that balance speed and fidelity.

Abstract: Modern scientific simulations and instruments generate data volumes that
overwhelm memory and storage, throttling scalability. Lossy compression
mitigates this by trading controlled error for reduced footprint and throughput
gains, yet optimal pipelines are highly data and objective specific, demanding
compression expertise. GPU compressors supply raw throughput but often
hard-code fused kernels that hinder rapid experimentation, and underperform in
rate-distortion. We present FZModules, a heterogeneous framework for assembling
error-bounded custom compression pipelines from high-performance modules
through a concise extensible interface. We further utilize an asynchronous
task-backed execution library that infers data dependencies, manages memory
movement, and exposes branch and stage level concurrency for powerful
asynchronous compression pipelines. Evaluating three pipelines built with
FZModules on four representative scientific datasets, we show they can compare
end-to-end speedup of fused-kernel GPU compressors while achieving similar
rate-distortion to higher fidelity CPU or hybrid compressors, enabling rapid,
domain-tailored design.

Motivation: To address the emerging need to merge HPC capabilities with cloud-based technologies for deploying GenAI workloads.

Method: The paper shares a converged computing architecture combining HPC and Kubernetes platforms, deploying Llama LLM across both environments using containerized inference servers.

Result: Successful deployment was achieved, and practical insights and challenges for HPC containerized environments were identified.

Conclusion: This study aids in bridging HPC and cloud computing for GenAI workloads and informs future research on HPC container tool development.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) applications are built from

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse matrix operations are crucial in multiple computational scenarios, but current libraries face inefficiencies in communication and computation, necessitating advancements.

Method: The authors use an Identify-Exchange-Build strategy that minimizes communication overhead, combined with synchronization-free multithreaded algorithms for local computation.

Result: Experiments conducted on clusters and supercomputers demonstrated better performance compared to CombBLAS and PETSc across multiple application scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithms and software provide substantial computational benefits making them suitable for diverse sparse matrix applications.

Abstract: We present scalable distributed-memory algorithms for sparse matrix
permutation, extraction, and assignment. Our methods follow an
Identify-Exchange-Build (IEB) strategy where each process identifies the local
nonzeros to be sent, exchanges the required data, and then builds its local
submatrix from the received elements. This approach reduces communication
compared to SpGEMM-based methods in distributed memory. By employing
synchronization-free multithreaded algorithms, we further accelerate local
computations, achieving substantially better performance than existing
libraries such as CombBLAS and PETSc. We design efficient software for these
operations and evaluate their performance on two university clusters and the
Perlmutter supercomputer. Our experiments span a variety of application
scenarios, including matrix permutation for load balancing, matrix reordering,
subgraph extraction, and streaming graph applications. In all cases, we compare
our algorithms against CombBLAS, the most comprehensive distributed library for
these operations, and, in some scenarios, against PETSc. Overall, this work

TL;DR: RADICAL-Pilot (RP), integrated with runtime systems Flux and Dragon, offers significant performance improvements for hybrid AI and HPC workloads compared to traditional launchers like Slurm's srun. RP achieves up to 1,500 tasks/s and boosts resource utilization over 99.6%, while srun struggles with scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address inefficiencies in current workload management systems like Slurm's srun, especially for dynamic, heterogeneous scientific workflows combining HPC and machine learning tasks.

Method: The authors integrate RADICAL-Pilot (RP) with runtime systems Flux and Dragon to enable hierarchical resource scheduling and better task execution. They conducted performance studies using synthetic and production-scale workloads on Frontier to evaluate scalability and throughput.

Result: RP integrated with Flux and Dragon achieves task execution rates of up to 1,500 tasks/s, with utilization exceeding 99.6%. By contrast, srun peaks at merely 152 tasks/s and suffers from scalability issues. For real-world use cases like the IMPECCABLE.v2 drug discovery campaign, RP+Flux demonstrates significant makespan reductions (30-60%) and throughput boosts (400%).

Conclusion: The integration of hybrid runtime systems in RADICAL-Pilot shows notable improvements in scalability, concurrency, and resource utilization, making it ideal for hybrid AI-HPC workflows compared to traditional workload managers such as Slurm's srun.

Abstract: Scientific workflows increasingly involve both HPC and machine-learning
tasks, combining MPI-based simulations, training, and inference in a single
execution. Launchers such as Slurm's srun constrain concurrency and throughput,
making them unsuitable for dynamic and heterogeneous workloads. We present a
performance study of RADICAL-Pilot (RP) integrated with Flux and Dragon, two
complementary runtime systems that enable hierarchical resource management and
high-throughput function execution. Using synthetic and production-scale
workloads on Frontier, we characterize the task execution properties of RP
across runtime configurations. RP+Flux sustains up to 930 tasks/s, and
RP+Flux+Dragon exceeds 1,500 tasks/s with over 99.6% utilization. In contrast,
srun peaks at 152 tasks/s and degrades with scale, with utilization below 50%.
For IMPECCABLE.v2 drug discovery campaign, RP+Flux reduces makespan by 30-60%
relative to srun/Slurm and increases throughput more than four times on up to
1,024. These results demonstrate hybrid runtime integration in RP as a scalable
approach for hybrid AI-HPC workloads.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a distributed in-memory computing (IMC) solution using RRAM devices for large-scale linear programming (LP) problems, achieving significant energy and latency reductions compared to conventional architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The exponential growth of computational workloads requires alternatives to conventional architectures, which are limited by fundamental constraints. IMC using RRAM offers potential efficiency gains but faces challenges translating conventional algorithms, particularly for constrained optimization problems.

Method: The authors propose a primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) methodology tailored for RRAM arrays. The method minimizes RRAM write cycles, improves robustness to device imperfections, and unifies operations with symmetric block-matrix frameworks. They also use MELISO+ physics-based simulations for realistic device condition evaluations.

Result: Experimental benchmarks reveal that the proposed RRAM-based solver achieves comparable accuracy to GPU-accelerated solvers while reducing energy consumption and latency by up to three orders of magnitude in large-scale linear programs.

Conclusion: This work showcases the viability of RRAM-based solvers for optimization problems using a novel algorithm-hardware co-design approach, underscoring the transformative potential of distributed in-memory computing in tackling large-scale optimization challenges.

Abstract: The exponential growth of computational workloads is surpassing the
capabilities of conventional architectures, which are constrained by
fundamental limits. In-memory computing (IMC) with RRAM provides a promising
alternative by providing analog computations with significant gains in latency
and energy use. However, existing algorithms developed for conventional
architectures do not translate to IMC, particularly for constrained
optimization problems where frequent matrix reprogramming remains
cost-prohibitive for IMC applications. Here we present a distributed in-memory
primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) method, specifically co-designed for arrays
of RRAM devices. Our approach minimizes costly write cycles, incorporates
robustness against device non-idealities, and leverages a symmetric
block-matrix formulation to unify operations across distributed crossbars. We
integrate a physics-based simulation framework called MELISO+ to evaluate
performance under realistic device conditions. Benchmarking against
GPU-accelerated solvers on large-scale linear programs demonstrates that our
RRAM-based solver achieves comparable accuracy with up to three orders of
magnitude reductions in energy consumption and latency. These results
demonstrate the first PDHG-based LP solver implemented on RRAMs, showcasing the
transformative potential of algorithm-hardware co-design for solving
large-scale optimization through distributed in-memory computing.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces "tail batching" as a scheduling strategy in reinforcement learning (RL) to address GPU underutilization, significantly boosting training efficiency without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the issue of GPU underutilization in synchronous RL caused by imbalanced response lengths during rollout steps, leading to inefficiencies in training.

Method: The paper introduces "tail batching," which consolidates prompts with long-tail responses into specific long rounds of rollout while ensuring that short rounds remain balanced. Coupled with the RollPacker system, it applies optimizations over rollout, reward allocation, and training stages.

Result: RollPacker and tail batching achieve a 2.03x-2.56x reduction in end-to-end training time compared to veRL and up to 2.24x speedup compared to RLHFuse, evaluated on the Qwen2.5 LLM family across up to 128 H800 GPUs.

Conclusion: Tail batching and the RollPacker system effectively reduce GPU idle time in synchronous RL without sacrificing training accuracy, offering significant speedups in large-scale training scenarios.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a pivotal post-training technique for
enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
synchronous RL post-training often suffers from significant GPU
underutilization, referred to as bubbles, caused by imbalanced response lengths
within rollout steps. Many RL systems attempt to alleviate this problem by
relaxing synchronization, but this can compromise training accuracy. In this
paper, we introduce tail batching, a novel rollout scheduling strategy for
synchronous RL that systematically consolidates prompts leading to long-tail
responses into a small subset of rollout steps (long rounds), while ensuring
that the majority of steps (short rounds) involve only balanced, short
rollouts. By excluding long responses from short rounds and rescheduling them
into a few designated long rounds, tail batching effectively reduces GPU idle
time during rollouts and significantly accelerates RL training without
sacrificing accuracy. We present RollPacker, a system that fully harnesses the
benefits of tail batching through holistic optimizations across all three RL
stages: elastic parallelism adaptation for rollout, dynamic resource allocation
and scheduling for reward, and stream-based training. Empirical results show
that RollPacker achieves a 2.03x-2.56x end-to-end training time reduction
compared to veRL and up to 2.24x speedup compared to RLHFuse for the Qwen2.5
family of LLMs on up to 128 H800 GPUs.

Motivation: To reduce the overhead of explicitly assembling dense Schur complement matrices when solving engineering problems, particularly as GPU-based high-performance computing clusters are becoming prevalent.

Method: The authors propose optimizing the GPU assembly process by utilizing the sparsity of input matrices within the context of Finite Element Tearing and Interconnecting (FETI) methods.

Result: The improved GPU assembly achieved a speedup of 5.1 in GPU-related computations and 3.3 in the entire assembly process, proving effective for iterative solvers in as few as 10 iterations.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that optimizing assembly methods by exploiting matrix sparsity can significantly enhance the efficiency of domain decomposition methods on GPUs, making them more practical for large-scale engineering problems.

Abstract: Schur complement matrices emerge in many domain decomposition methods that
can solve complex engineering problems using supercomputers. Today, as most of
the high-performance clusters' performance lies in GPUs, these methods should
also be accelerated.
  Typically, the offloaded components are the explicitly assembled dense Schur
complement matrices used later in the iterative solver for multiplication with
a vector. As the explicit assembly is expensive, it represents a significant
overhead associated with this approach to acceleration. It has already been
shown that the overhead can be minimized by assembling the Schur complements
directly on the GPU.
  This paper shows that the GPU assembly can be further improved by wisely
utilizing the sparsity of the input matrices. In the context of FETI methods,
we achieved a speedup of 5.1 in the GPU section of the code and 3.3 for the
whole assembly, making the acceleration beneficial from as few as 10
iterations.

*William F. Godoy,Tatiana Melnichenko,Pedro Valero-Lara,Wael Elwasif,Philip Fackler,Rafael Ferreira Da Silva,Keita Teranishi,Jeffrey S. Vetter*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper evaluates Mojo's GPU performance for scientific workloads, showing competitive results with CUDA/HIP but weaknesses in atomic and fast-math compute-bound operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address gaps in performance and productivity for scientific computing by leveraging Mojo, which integrates Python-like simplicity and GPU programming features.

Method: Four scientific workloads are implemented using Mojo and benchmarked against vendor standards on NVIDIA H100 and AMD MI300A GPUs.

Result: Mojo performs competitively with CUDA/HIP on memory-bound tasks but shows performance gaps in atomic operations and fast-math computations on AMD and NVIDIA GPUs.

Conclusion: Mojo demonstrates potential in unifying Python's ease of use with high-performance GPU programming, albeit requiring enhancements in atomic and fast-math computation capabilities.

Abstract: We explore the performance and portability of the novel Mojo language for
scientific computing workloads on GPUs. As the first language based on the
LLVM's Multi-Level Intermediate Representation (MLIR) compiler infrastructure,
Mojo aims to close performance and productivity gaps by combining Python's
interoperability and CUDA-like syntax for compile-time portable GPU
programming. We target four scientific workloads: a seven-point stencil
(memory-bound), BabelStream (memory-bound), miniBUDE (compute-bound), and
Hartree-Fock (compute-bound with atomic operations); and compare their
performance against vendor baselines on NVIDIA H100 and AMD MI300A GPUs. We
show that Mojo's performance is competitive with CUDA and HIP for memory-bound
kernels, whereas gaps exist on AMD GPUs for atomic operations and for fast-math
compute-bound kernels on both AMD and NVIDIA GPUs. Although the learning curve
and programming requirements are still fairly low-level, Mojo can close
significant gaps in the fragmented Python ecosystem in the convergence of
scientific computing and AI.

### [201] [Data-Centric Elastic Pipeline Parallelism for Efficient Long-Context LLM Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21275)
*Shiju Wang,Yujie Wang,Ao Sun,Fangcheng Fu,Zijian Zhu,Bin Cui,Xu Han,Kaisheng Ma*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Elastic Pipeline Parallelism" (EPP) to address resource and workload inefficiencies in long-context training for large language models, achieving better performance via adaptive granularity and optimizing pipeline scheduling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for long-context training in LLMs, like sequence parallelism, face high communication overhead, while pipeline parallelism struggles with trade-offs between memory consumption and hardware utilization.

Method: The authors propose EPP and build InfiniPipe, employing a resource-aware sequence processor for workload balancing, along with adaptive gradient checkpointing optimization for efficiency.

Result: InfiniPipe demonstrates a 1.69x speedup over current state-of-the-art systems in distributed training scenarios.

Conclusion: Elastic Pipeline Parallelism effectively balances token-level and batch-level pipeline parallelism, addressing resource heterogeneity and workload skewness in distributed training of large language models.

Abstract: Long context training is crucial for LLM's context extension. Existing
schemes, such as sequence parallelism, incur substantial communication
overhead. Pipeline parallelism (PP) reduces this cost, but its effectiveness
hinges on partitioning granularity. Batch-level PP dividing input samples
exhibits high memory consumption in long-context scenario, whereas token-level
PP splitting sequences into slices alleviates memory overhead but may incur
hardware under-utilization. This trade-off motivates adaptively selecting PP
granularity to match resource and workload characteristics. Moreover, sequence
length distribution of the real-world dataset exhibits skewness, posing a
challenge on PP's workload balance and efficient scheduling. Current static PP
scheduling methods overlook the variance of sequence length, leading to
suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose Elastic Pipeline Parallelism
(EPP) that orchestrates token-level PP and batch-level PP to adapt to resource
and workload heterogeneity. We build InfiniPipe, a distributed training system
that unleashes the potential of EPP via (1) a resource-aware and
workload-balanced sequence processor that splits long sequences and packs short
ones; and (2) a co-optimization methodology that jointly optimizes pipeline
schedule and gradient checkpointing via a mechanism named stage-aware
chunk-level adaptive checkpointing. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
InfiniPipe achieves a 1.69x speedup over state-of-the-art systems.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a theoretical framework for deriving efficient learning algorithms using least action principles from physics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to create highly efficient learning systems that minimize the time and observations required to achieve a specific error threshold.

Method: Utilizing the concept of the Learning Lagrangian, they derive existing learning algorithms and optimizers by identifying stationary paths in this theoretical framework.

Result: Classic learning algorithms, Bellman’s optimality equation in reinforcement learning, and the Adam optimizer were derived using this novel approach.

Conclusion: The framework provides a unified, first-principles basis for understanding and deriving efficient learning algorithms by modeling them as stationary paths in the Lagrangian.

Abstract: We study the problem of building an efficient learning system. Efficient
learning processes information in the least time, i.e., building a system that
reaches a desired error threshold with the least number of observations.
Building upon least action principles from physics, we derive classic learning
algorithms, Bellman's optimality equation in reinforcement learning, and the
Adam optimizer in generative models from first principles, i.e., the Learning

in the Lagrangian, and learning algorithms are derivable by seeking the
stationary trajectories.

### [203] [Sig2Model: A Boosting-Driven Model for Updatable Learned Indexes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20781)
*Alireza Heidari,Amirhossein Ahmad,Wei Zhang,Ying Xiong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sig2Model introduces an adaptive learned index approach minimizing retraining costs for dynamic datasets, boosting performance significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learned Indexes struggle with dynamic updates due to retraining costs negatively impacting queries-per-second (QPS).

Method: Sig2Model employs sigmoid boosting for local CDF adjustments, Gaussian mixture models for proactive update allocation, and a neural joint optimization framework for continuous refinement.

Result: Sig2Model substantially reduces retraining costs (up to 20x), improves QPS (up to 3x), and decreases memory usage (up to 1000x) compared to state-of-the-art solutions.

Conclusion: Sig2Model effectively addresses dynamic update challenges in learned indexes, providing a scalable solution suitable for real-world workloads.

Abstract: Learned Indexes (LIs) represent a paradigm shift from traditional index
structures by employing machine learning models to approximate the cumulative
distribution function (CDF) of sorted data. While LIs achieve remarkable
efficiency for static datasets, their performance degrades under dynamic
updates: maintaining the CDF invariant (sum of F(k) equals 1) requires global
model retraining, which blocks queries and limits the queries-per-second (QPS)
metric. Current approaches fail to address these retraining costs effectively,
rendering them unsuitable for real-world workloads with frequent updates. In
this paper, we present Sig2Model, an efficient and adaptive learned index that
minimizes retraining cost through three key techniques: (1) a sigmoid boosting
approximation technique that dynamically adjusts the index model by
approximating update-induced shifts in data distribution with localized sigmoid
functions while preserving bounded error guarantees and deferring full
retraining; (2) proactive update training via Gaussian mixture models (GMMs)
that identifies high-update-probability regions for strategic placeholder
allocation to speed up updates; and (3) a neural joint optimization framework
that continuously refines both the sigmoid ensemble and GMM parameters via
gradient-based learning. We evaluate Sig2Model against state-of-the-art
updatable learned indexes on real-world and synthetic workloads, and show that
Sig2Model reduces retraining cost by up to 20x, achieves up to 3x higher QPS,
and uses up to 1000x less memory.

*Leo Maxime Brunswic,Haozhi Wang,Shuang Luo,Jianye Hao,Amir Rasouli,Yinchuan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a theoretical framework and algorithms for multi-agent generative flow networks (MA-GFlowNets) to enable collaborative object generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: A theoretical framework for extending generative flow networks (GFNs) to multi-agent scenarios, where agents generate objects collaboratively, was lacking.

Method: The authors propose MA-GFlowNets along with four algorithms: centralized, independent, joint flow network, and an updated conditional version for different training and execution setups. Joint Flow training uses a local-global principle for scalability and theoretical performance guarantees.

Result: The experimental results show that the proposed MA-GFlowNets outperform reinforcement learning and MCMC-based methods in relevant tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework advances the field of multi-agent generative systems with theoretical guarantees and superior empirical performance across diverse setups.

Abstract: Generative flow networks utilize a flow-matching loss to learn a stochastic
policy for generating objects from a sequence of actions, such that the
probability of generating a pattern can be proportional to the corresponding
given reward. However, a theoretical framework for multi-agent generative flow
networks (MA-GFlowNets) has not yet been proposed. In this paper, we propose
the theory framework of MA-GFlowNets, which can be applied to multiple agents
to generate objects collaboratively through a series of joint actions. We
further propose four algorithms: a centralized flow network for centralized
training of MA-GFlowNets, an independent flow network for decentralized
execution, a joint flow network for achieving centralized training with
decentralized execution, and its updated conditional version. Joint Flow
training is based on a local-global principle allowing to train a collection of
(local) GFN as a unique (global) GFN. This principle provides a loss of
reasonable complexity and allows to leverage usual results on GFN to provide
theoretical guarantees that the independent policies generate samples with
probability proportional to the reward function. Experimental results
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework compared to reinforcement
learning and MCMC-based methods.

*Haiduo Huang,Jiangcheng Song,Wenzhe Zhao,Pengju Ren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FastEagle is a non-autoregressive system that generates drafts in one forward pass, improving speed without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing speculative decoding methods are slow due to sequential dependence in token generation.

Method: FastEagle uses a cascaded approach with layer-wise supervision and a constrained draft tree to replace sequential passes.

Result: FastEagle achieves significant speed gains and maintains competitive output quality across multiple models and tasks.

Conclusion: Removing sequential dependencies in speculative decoding is a viable strategy for faster LLM inference with high accuracy.

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates generation by drafting candidates and
verifying them in parallel, yet state-of-the-art drafters (e.g., EAGLE) still
require N sequential passes to propose N tokens. We present FastEagle, a
non-autoregressive cascaded drafter that emits an entire draft in a single
forward pass. FastEagle replaces temporal steps with a lightweight layer
cascade and trains with layer-wise supervision to mitigate error accumulation.
Coupled with a constrained draft tree that preserves lossless verification
cost, FastEagle delivers substantial wall-clock speedups over strong
autoregressive drafters while maintaining competitive acceptance behavior.
Across multiple LLMs (Vicuna-13B, LLaMA-Instruct 3.x, and
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA) and tasks (MT-Bench, HumanEval, GSM8K, CNN/DM,
Alpaca), FastEagle consistently outperforms EAGLE-3 in speedup under both
greedy and stochastic decoding, with comparable average acceptance lengths.
These results indicate that removing sequential dependencies in drafting is a
practical path toward lossless LLM inference acceleration.

*Yiling Ma,Nathan Luke Abraham,Stefan Versick,Roland Ruhnke,Andrea Schneidereit,Ulrike Niemeier,Felix Back,Peter Braesicke,Peer Nowack*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a machine learning parameterization (mloz) to model ozone variability and trends more efficiently in climate sensitivity simulations, showing up to 31x speed improvement in predictions over traditional chemistry schemes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most climate models lack interactive ozone modeling due to the high computational demands of atmospheric chemistry schemes, despite ozone's pivotal role in modulating climate processes.

Method: Developed and tested a machine learning parameterization (mloz) that uses atmospheric temperature profiles to provide ozone predictions. The model was validated on two climate models, UK Earth System Model (UKESM) and the ICON model.

Result: The machine learning approach proved 31 times faster than chemistry models and contributed less than 4% runtime overhead, successfully transferring to models without existing chemistry schemes.

Conclusion: The parameterization enables efficient integration of interactive ozone models in CMIP-level climate models, aiding accurate climate change assessments focused on ozone's impact on atmospheric feedbacks.

Abstract: Atmospheric ozone is a crucial absorber of solar radiation and an important
greenhouse gas. However, most climate models participating in the Coupled Model
Intercomparison Project (CMIP) still lack an interactive representation of
ozone due to the high computational costs of atmospheric chemistry schemes.
Here, we introduce a machine learning parameterization (mloz) to interactively
model daily ozone variability and trends across the troposphere and
stratosphere in standard climate sensitivity simulations, including two-way
interactions of ozone with the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation. We demonstrate its
high fidelity on decadal timescales and its flexible use online across two
different climate models -- the UK Earth System Model (UKESM) and the German
ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic (ICON) model. With atmospheric temperature profile
information as the only input, mloz produces stable ozone predictions around 31
times faster than the chemistry scheme in UKESM, contributing less than 4
percent of the respective total climate model runtimes. In particular, we also
demonstrate its transferability to different climate models without chemistry
schemes by transferring the parameterization from UKESM to ICON. This
highlights the potential for widespread adoption in CMIP-level climate models
that lack interactive chemistry for future climate change assessments,
particularly when focusing on climate sensitivity simulations, where ozone
trends and variability are known to significantly modulate atmospheric feedback
processes.

TL;DR: The paper discusses a transformer-based autoencoder to anonymize EEG data, making it less re-identifiable while retaining its utility, demonstrated in the context of sleep staging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The privacy concerns arising from EEG data's potential for re-identification and personal information leakage, especially with the growth of consumer EEG devices.

Method: Development and application of a transformer-based autoencoder to anonymize EEG data while maintaining its utility for machine learning tasks.

Result: The proposed method significantly reduces the re-identifiability of EEG data while preserving its effectiveness in tasks such as automatic sleep staging.

Conclusion: EEG data can be anonymized using the proposed method without compromising its utility, addressing critical privacy concerns in EEG applications.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is widely used for recording brain activity and
has seen numerous applications in machine learning, such as detecting sleep
stages and neurological disorders. Several studies have successfully shown the
potential of EEG data for re-identification and leakage of other personal
information. Therefore, the increasing availability of EEG consumer devices
raises concerns about user privacy, motivating us to investigate how to
safeguard this sensitive data while retaining its utility for EEG applications.
To address this challenge, we propose a transformer-based autoencoder to create
EEG data that does not allow for subject re-identification while still
retaining its utility for specific machine learning tasks. We apply our
approach to automatic sleep staging by evaluating the re-identification and
utility potential of EEG data before and after anonymization. The results show
that the re-identifiability of the EEG signal can be substantially reduced
while preserving its utility for machine learning.

### [208] [Efficiently Attacking Memorization Scores](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20463)
*Tue Do,Varun Chandrasekaran,Daniel Alabi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper systematically studies the feasibility of attacking memorization-based influence estimators, demonstrating their vulnerability to adversarial score manipulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether widely-used influence estimation scores, like memorization scores, can be adversarially manipulated, given their growing use in sensitive domains like data valuation and responsible machine learning.

Method: The authors propose a black-box attack for manipulating memorization scores by calculating the pseudoinverse of the input, which is computationally efficient. They conduct a suite of empirical validations across various image classification tasks and provide theoretical analysis on the stability of memorization scores.

Result: Empirical findings confirmed that state-of-the-art influence estimation methods are vulnerable to adversarial manipulations. Theoretical analysis identified conditions under which these scores become fragile.

Conclusion: Influence estimation techniques are susceptible to adversarial manipulations, raising concerns for their reliability. Robust defenses are necessary to address these vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Influence estimation tools -- such as memorization scores -- are widely used
to understand model behavior, attribute training data, and inform dataset
curation. However, recent applications in data valuation and responsible
machine learning raise the question: can these scores themselves be
adversarially manipulated? In this work, we present a systematic study of the
feasibility of attacking memorization-based influence estimators. We
characterize attacks for producing highly memorized samples as highly sensitive
queries in the regime where a trained algorithm is accurate. Our attack
(calculating the pseudoinverse of the input) is practical, requiring only
black-box access to model outputs and incur modest computational overhead. We
empirically validate our attack across a wide suite of image classification
tasks, showing that even state-of-the-art proxies are vulnerable to targeted
score manipulations. In addition, we provide a theoretical analysis of the
stability of memorization scores under adversarial perturbations, revealing
conditions under which influence estimates are inherently fragile. Our findings
highlight critical vulnerabilities in influence-based attribution and suggest
the need for robust defenses. All code can be found at

### [209] [Offline Goal-conditioned Reinforcement Learning with Quasimetric Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20478)
*Vivek Myers,Bill Chunyuan Zheng,Benjamin Eysenbach,Sergey Levine*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a unified approach for goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) by combining contrastive and temporal distance representation frameworks to achieve optimal goal-reaching, even in suboptimal and stochastic settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing frameworks like contrastive representations and temporal distances have distinct strengths in GCRL, but none fully balance stability, long-horizon learning, and effective stitching in complex environments, motivating the need for a unified method.

Method: The authors unify contrastive learning and quasimetric representations, leveraging the triangle inequality within quasimetric spaces and combining it with additional constraints to learn successor representations for optimal goal-reaching.

Result: The proposed approach improves GCRL performance on offline benchmarks, especially on stitching tasks and in noisy, high-dimensional environments where existing methods face challenges.

Conclusion: This unified method combines the advantages of contrastive and quasimetric frameworks, offering a robust solution for GCRL in challenging scenarios with suboptimal data and stochasticity.

Abstract: Approaches for goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) often use
learned state representations to extract goal-reaching policies. Two frameworks
for representation structure have yielded particularly effective GCRL
algorithms: (1) *contrastive representations*, in which methods learn
"successor features" with a contrastive objective that performs inference over
future outcomes, and (2) *temporal distances*, which link the (quasimetric)
distance in representation space to the transit time from states to goals. We
propose an approach that unifies these two frameworks, using the structure of a
quasimetric representation space (triangle inequality) with the right
additional constraints to learn successor representations that enable optimal
goal-reaching. Unlike past work, our approach is able to exploit a
**quasimetric** distance parameterization to learn **optimal** goal-reaching
distances, even with **suboptimal** data and in **stochastic** environments.
This gives us the best of both worlds: we retain the stability and long-horizon
capabilities of Monte Carlo contrastive RL methods, while getting the free
stitching capabilities of quasimetric network parameterizations. On existing
offline GCRL benchmarks, our representation learning objective improves
performance on stitching tasks where methods based on contrastive learning
struggle, and on noisy, high-dimensional environments where methods based on
quasimetric networks struggle.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a deep-learning framework for extracting meaningful features from EEG signals, addressing issues such as noise and variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the feature extraction from raw EEG signals for better understanding of brain states and related diagnostics, overcoming challenges like noise and channel variability.

Method: The method includes a multi-scale frequency encoder, attention-based encoder for modeling dependencies, a gating network for filtering channels, and a novel loss function using supervised and contrastive learning.

Result: The framework successfully demonstrated effectiveness in classifying CNS disorder treatments, diagnosing Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, and generalizing across species.

Conclusion: The proposed approach reliably extracts biologically meaningful EEG patterns, autonomously identifies high-quality channels, and offers robust generalization for diverse tasks.

Abstract: Electroencephalography signals (EEGs) contain rich multi-scale information
crucial for understanding brain states, with potential applications in
diagnosing and advancing the drug development landscape. However, extracting
meaningful features from raw EEG signals while handling noise and channel
variability remains a major challenge. This work proposes a novel end-to-end
deep-learning framework that addresses these issues through several key
innovations. First, we designed an encoder capable of explicitly capturing
multi-scale frequency oscillations covering a wide range of features for
different EEG-related tasks. Secondly, to model complex dependencies and handle
the high temporal resolution of EEGs, we introduced an attention-based encoder
that simultaneously learns interactions across EEG channels and within
localized {\em patches} of individual channels. We integrated a dedicated
gating network on top of the attention encoder to dynamically filter out noisy
and non-informative channels, enhancing the reliability of EEG data. The entire
encoding process is guided by a novel loss function, which leverages supervised
and contrastive learning, significantly improving model generalization. We
validated our approach in multiple applications, ranging from the
classification of effects across multiple Central Nervous System (CNS)
disorders treatments to the diagnosis of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease.
Our results demonstrate that the proposed learning paradigm can extract
biologically meaningful patterns from raw EEG signals across different species,
autonomously select high-quality channels, and achieve robust generalization
through innovative architectural and loss design.

*Kishor Datta Gupta,Mohd Ariful Haque,Marufa Kamal,Ahmed Rafi Hasan,Md. Mahfuzur Rahman,Roy George*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DARTVAE is a clustering method integrating rule-based domain constraints with variational autoencoders to enhance clustering quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cluster structures often fail to incorporate domain-specific constraints, leading to suboptimal and less interpretable groupings.

Method: DARTVAE uses variational autoencoders combined with rule generation from LLMs, incorporating these rules as learning signals to form an enriched unified latent space.

Result: DARTVAE demonstrated the creation of operationally meaningful clusters in automotive and aircraft datasets while improving clustering metrics.

Conclusion: Integrating domain-specific constraints into clustering processes allows for more interpretable and meaningful results compared to purely data-driven methods.

Abstract: Traditional clustering techniques often rely solely on similarity in the
input data, limiting their ability to capture structural or semantic
constraints that are critical in many domains. We introduce the Domain Aware
Rule Triggered Variational Autoencoder (DARTVAE), a rule guided multimodal
clustering framework that incorporates domain specific constraints directly
into the representation learning process. DARTVAE extends the VAE architecture
by embedding explicit rules, semantic representations, and data driven features
into a unified latent space, while enforcing constraint compliance through rule
consistency and violation penalties in the loss function. Unlike conventional
clustering methods that rely only on visual similarity or apply rules as post
hoc filters, DARTVAE treats rules as first class learning signals. The rules
are generated by LLMs, structured into knowledge graphs, and enforced through a
loss function combining reconstruction, KL divergence, consistency, and
violation penalties. Experiments on aircraft and automotive datasets
demonstrate that rule guided clustering produces more operationally meaningful
and interpretable clusters for example, isolating UAVs, unifying stealth
aircraft, or separating SUVs from sedans while improving traditional clustering
metrics. However, the framework faces challenges: LLM generated rules may
hallucinate or conflict, excessive rules risk overfitting, and scaling to
complex domains increases computational and consistency difficulties. By
combining rule encodings with learned representations, DARTVAE achieves more
meaningful and consistent clustering outcomes than purely data driven models,
highlighting the utility of constraint guided multimodal clustering for
complex, knowledge intensive settings.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel algorithm to optimize attention layers, reducing compute and memory usage, by efficiently inverting tree-structured matrices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Attention layers face scalability issues due to their quadratic dependence on sequence length during pairwise interaction calculations.

Method: The authors propose combining sparsity and recurrent dependence concepts, utilizing efficient inversion of tree-structured matrices.

Result: The proposed algorithm mitigates memory and computation costs while maintaining effectiveness in sequence mapping.

Conclusion: The algorithm combines the strengths of sparsity and recurrence, presenting a scalable and efficient design for attention layers.

Abstract: Attention layers apply a sequence-to-sequence mapping whose parameters depend
on the pairwise interactions of the input elements. However, without any
structural assumptions, memory and compute scale quadratically with the
sequence length. The two main ways to mitigate this are to introduce sparsity
by ignoring a sufficient amount of pairwise interactions or to introduce
recurrent dependence along them, as SSM does. Although both approaches are
reasonable, they both have disadvantages. We propose a novel algorithm that
combines the advantages of both concepts. Our idea is based on the efficient
inversion of tree-structured matrices.

TL;DR: A deep learning model predicts damage progression in concrete over time using U-Net for damage estimation and CNN for mechanical properties forecasting, reducing computational effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assessing time-dependent full-field damage in concrete is computationally intensive, necessitating efficient and accurate prediction methods to optimize mix designs and improve durability.

Method: An auto-regressive U-Net predicts damage progression sequentially, while a CNN forecasts mechanical properties based on damage estimations, forming a dual-network architecture.

Result: The model efficiently predicts damage progression and mechanical properties, demonstrating high computational efficiency and robust performance on synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: The approach delivers insights into aggregate properties and their impact on shrinkage and stiffness, contributing to optimizing concrete mix designs for enhanced durability and reduced damage.

Abstract: This paper introduces a deep learning approach for predicting time-dependent
full-field damage in concrete. The study uses an auto-regressive U-Net model to
predict the evolution of the scalar damage field in a unit cell given
microstructural geometry and evolution of an imposed shrinkage profile. By
sequentially using the predicted damage output as input for subsequent
predictions, the model facilitates the continuous assessment of damage
progression. Complementarily, a convolutional neural network (CNN) utilises the
damage estimations to forecast key mechanical properties, including observed
shrinkage and residual stiffness. The proposed dual-network architecture
demonstrates high computational efficiency and robust predictive performance on
the synthesised datasets. The approach reduces the computational load
traditionally associated with full-field damage evaluations and is used to gain
insights into the relationship between aggregate properties, such as shape,
size, and distribution, and the effective shrinkage and reduction in stiffness.
Ultimately, this can help to optimize concrete mix designs, leading to improved
durability and reduced internal damage.

### [214] [Complexity-Driven Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20509)
*Luca Serfilippi,Giorgio Franceschelli,Antonio Corradi,Mirco Musolesi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a complexity-driven policy optimization method (CDPO) that replaces the entropy bonus in policy gradient methods with a complexity regularizer to enhance structured exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Entropy maximization in policy gradient methods can lead to inefficient exploration by pushing policies towards uniform randomness. A more structured exploration strategy is needed.

Method: A complexity bonus is introduced, defined as the product of Shannon entropy and disequilibrium, to promote balance between stochasticity and structure. This replaces the entropy bonus in the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) framework.

Result: The proposed CDPO algorithm demonstrates improved robustness to hyperparameter choices and excels in environments requiring structured exploration compared to standard entropy-driven PPO.

Conclusion: CDPO facilitates useful and adaptable agent behaviors by encouraging a balance between randomness and order, alleviating issues with extreme exploration strategies.

Abstract: Policy gradient methods often balance exploitation and exploration via
entropy maximization. However, maximizing entropy pushes the policy towards a
uniform random distribution, which represents an unstructured and sometimes
inefficient exploration strategy. In this work, we propose replacing the
entropy bonus with a more robust complexity bonus. In particular, we adopt a
measure of complexity, defined as the product of Shannon entropy and
disequilibrium, where the latter quantifies the distance from the uniform
distribution. This regularizer encourages policies that balance stochasticity
(high entropy) with structure (high disequilibrium), guiding agents toward
regimes where useful, non-trivial behaviors can emerge. Such behaviors arise
because the regularizer suppresses both extremes, e.g., maximal disorder and
complete order, creating pressure for agents to discover structured yet
adaptable strategies. Starting from Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), we
introduce Complexity-Driven Policy Optimization (CDPO), a new learning
algorithm that replaces entropy with complexity. We show empirically across a
range of discrete action space tasks that CDPO is more robust to the choice of
the complexity coefficient than PPO is with the entropy coefficient, especially
in environments requiring greater exploration.

### [215] [A Recovery Theory for Diffusion Priors: Deterministic Analysis of the Implicit Prior Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20511)
*Oscar Leong,Yann Traonmilin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper develops a theoretical framework to analyze deterministic diffusion-based algorithms for inverse problems, focusing on their convergence rates and effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of recovering high-dimensional signals from corrupted measurements by providing rigorous analysis for deterministic diffusion-based algorithms, which has been lacking despite their empirical success.

Method: The authors analyze the deterministic version of a prior diffusion-based algorithm and interpret it as a generalized projected gradient descent method with varying projections. They derive convergence rates based on a restricted isometry property and test on specific data distributions.

Result: They demonstrate quantitative convergence rates dependent on the noise schedule and establish global convergence guarantees for specific low-dimensional data distributions, even in nonconvex settings.

Conclusion: The findings provide a rigorous theoretical basis for deterministic diffusion-based algorithm applications in inverse problems, enhancing understanding and reliability.

Abstract: Recovering high-dimensional signals from corrupted measurements is a central
challenge in inverse problems. Recent advances in generative diffusion models
have shown remarkable empirical success in providing strong data-driven priors,
but rigorous recovery guarantees remain limited. In this work, we develop a
theoretical framework for analyzing deterministic diffusion-based algorithms
for inverse problems, focusing on a deterministic version of the algorithm
proposed by Kadkhodaie \& Simoncelli \cite{kadkhodaie2021stochastic}. First, we
show that when the underlying data distribution concentrates on a
low-dimensional model set, the associated noise-convolved scores can be
interpreted as time-varying projections onto such a set. This leads to
interpreting previous algorithms using diffusion priors for inverse problems as
generalized projected gradient descent methods with varying projections. When
the sensing matrix satisfies a restricted isometry property over the model set,
we can derive quantitative convergence rates that depend explicitly on the
noise schedule. We apply our framework to two instructive data distributions:
uniform distributions over low-dimensional compact, convex sets and low-rank
Gaussian mixture models. In the latter setting, we can establish global
convergence guarantees despite the nonconvexity of the underlying model set.

### [216] [The Sensitivity of Variational Bayesian Neural Network Performance to Hyperparameters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20574)
*Scott Koermer,Natalie Klein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies challenges in obtaining accurate uncertainty quantification (UQ) using Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) due to hyperparameter choices and proposes a global sensitivity analysis to address this.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate UQ is critical for predictive models in scientific applications, but BNNs face challenges due to training approximations and complex hyperparameter effects.

Method: The authors conducted a global sensitivity analysis on BNNs to study the impact of hyperparameter choices on predictive accuracy and UQ.

Result: The study found that hyperparameters in BNNs interact in complex ways, significantly affecting both predictive accuracy and UQ.

Conclusion: The paper recommends using global sensitivity analysis or similar methods, like Bayesian optimization, to optimize hyperparameters and enhance UQ in BNNs for real-world applications.

Abstract: In scientific applications, predictive modeling is often of limited use
without accurate uncertainty quantification (UQ) to indicate when a model may
be extrapolating or when more data needs to be collected. Bayesian Neural
Networks (BNNs) produce predictive uncertainty by propagating uncertainty in
neural network (NN) weights and offer the promise of obtaining not only an
accurate predictive model but also accurate UQ. However, in practice, obtaining
accurate UQ with BNNs is difficult due in part to the approximations used for
practical model training and in part to the need to choose a suitable set of
hyperparameters; these hyperparameters outnumber those needed for traditional
NNs and often have opaque effects on the results. We aim to shed light on the
effects of hyperparameter choices for BNNs by performing a global sensitivity
analysis of BNN performance under varying hyperparameter settings. Our results
indicate that many of the hyperparameters interact with each other to affect
both predictive accuracy and UQ. For improved usage of BNNs in real-world
applications, we suggest that global sensitivity analysis, or related methods
such as Bayesian optimization, should be used to aid in dimensionality
reduction and selection of hyperparameters to ensure accurate UQ in BNNs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MDBench is a benchmarking framework for model discovery methods that evaluates their performance on dynamical systems, including both PDEs and ODEs, under various noise levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the lack of comprehensive benchmarks for discovering dynamical models, particularly for methods beyond symbolic regression for single equations.

Method: The authors propose MDBench, an open-source framework that evaluates 12 algorithms on 14 PDEs and 63 ODEs using metrics like derivative prediction accuracy, model complexity, and equation fidelity, while introducing seven challenging PDE systems.

Result: The findings show that linear methods perform best for PDEs, genetic programming methods excel for ODEs, and linear models are generally more robust against noise.

Conclusion: MDBench offers a rigorous and extensible way to benchmark model discovery methods, facilitating systematic comparison and improvement in equation accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Model discovery aims to uncover governing differential equations of dynamical
systems directly from experimental data. Benchmarking such methods is essential
for tracking progress and understanding trade-offs in the field. While prior
efforts have focused mostly on identifying single equations, typically framed
as symbolic regression, there remains a lack of comprehensive benchmarks for
discovering dynamical models. To address this, we introduce MDBench, an
open-source benchmarking framework for evaluating model discovery methods on
dynamical systems. MDBench assesses 12 algorithms on 14 partial differential
equations (PDEs) and 63 ordinary differential equations (ODEs) under varying
levels of noise. Evaluation metrics include derivative prediction accuracy,
model complexity, and equation fidelity. We also introduce seven challenging
PDE systems from fluid dynamics and thermodynamics, revealing key limitations
in current methods. Our findings illustrate that linear methods and genetic
programming methods achieve the lowest prediction error for PDEs and ODEs,
respectively. Moreover, linear models are in general more robust against noise.
MDBench accelerates the advancement of model discovery methods by offering a
rigorous, extensible benchmarking framework and a rich, diverse collection of
dynamical system datasets, enabling systematic evaluation, comparison, and
improvement of equation accuracy and robustness.

*Tanzila Tabassum,Omer Subasi,Ajay Panyala,Epiya Ebiapia,Gerald Baumgartner,Erdal Mutlu,P.,Sadayappan,Karol Kowalski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops machine learning models to predict the cost and runtime parameters for chemistry computations on supercomputers, achieving accurate predictions and resource optimizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to assist users in estimating computational resource requirements and execution time before running expensive supercomputer experiments.

Method: A range of machine learning models, including Gradient Boosting and active learning strategies, were trained on data from CCSD computations on DOE's Frontier and Aurora supercomputers.

Result: The Gradient Boosting model achieves high accuracy with MAPE values of 0.023 for Aurora and 0.073 for Frontier. Active learning reduces experiments to around 450 while maintaining accurate predictions.

Conclusion: Machine learning techniques can effectively predict execution parameters and resource usage, aiding users in optimizing supercomputer experiments.

Abstract: In this work, we develop machine learning (ML) based strategies to predict
resources (costs) required for massively parallel chemistry computations, such
as coupled-cluster methods, to guide application users before they commit to
running expensive experiments on a supercomputer. By predicting application
execution time, we determine the optimal runtime parameter values such as
number of nodes and tile sizes. Two key questions of interest to users are
addressed. The first is the shortest-time question, where the user is
interested in knowing the parameter configurations (number of nodes and tile
sizes) to achieve the shortest execution time for a given problem size and a
target supercomputer. The second is the cheapest-run question in which the user
is interested in minimizing resource usage, i.e., finding the number of nodes
and tile size that minimizes the number of node-hours for a given problem size.
  We evaluate a rich family of ML models and strategies, developed based on the
collections of runtime parameter values for the CCSD (Coupled Cluster with
Singles and Doubles) application executed on the Department of Energy (DOE)
Frontier and Aurora supercomputers. Our experiments show that when predicting
the total execution time of a CCSD iteration, a Gradient Boosting (GB) ML model
achieves a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.023 and 0.073 for Aurora
and Frontier, respectively. In the case where it is expensive to run
experiments just to collect data points, we show that active learning can
achieve a MAPE of about 0.2 with just around 450 experiments collected from
Aurora and Frontier.

### [219] [Understanding and Improving Adversarial Robustness of Neural Probabilistic Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20549)
*Weixin Chen,Han Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces RNPC, a robust neural probabilistic circuit that enhances adversarial robustness in concept bottleneck models, demonstrating superior performance under adversarial attacks while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the vulnerability of neural probabilistic circuits (NPCs) to adversarial attacks through the attribute recognition model, which compromises both interpretability and performance.

Method: The paper proposes RNPC, incorporating a novel class-wise integration mechanism to increase the robustness of the model against adversarial attacks targeting the recognition module.

Result: RNPC is theoretically proven and empirically validated to have improved adversarial robustness compared to NPCs and other concept bottleneck models, while maintaining high accuracy on non-adversarial inputs.

Conclusion: RNPC successfully mitigates the adversarial vulnerability of traditional NPCs by focusing on robust attribute recognition without compromising interpretability or accuracy.

Abstract: Neural Probabilistic Circuits (NPCs), a new class of concept bottleneck
models, comprise an attribute recognition model and a probabilistic circuit for
reasoning. By integrating the outputs from these two modules, NPCs produce
compositional and interpretable predictions. While offering enhanced
interpretability and high performance on downstream tasks, the
neural-network-based attribute recognition model remains a black box. This
vulnerability allows adversarial attacks to manipulate attribute predictions by
introducing carefully crafted subtle perturbations to input images, potentially
compromising the final predictions. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the
adversarial robustness of NPC and demonstrate that it only depends on the
robustness of the attribute recognition model and is independent of the
robustness of the probabilistic circuit. Moreover, we propose RNPC, the first
robust neural probabilistic circuit against adversarial attacks on the
recognition module. RNPC introduces a novel class-wise integration for
inference, ensuring a robust combination of outputs from the two modules. Our
theoretical analysis demonstrates that RNPC exhibits provably improved
adversarial robustness compared to NPC. Empirical results on image
classification tasks show that RNPC achieves superior adversarial robustness
compared to existing concept bottleneck models while maintaining high accuracy
on benign inputs.

### [220] [Bispectral OT: Dataset Comparison using Symmetry-Aware Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20678)
*Annabel Ma,Kaiying Hou,David Alvarez-Melis,Melanie Weber*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Bispectral Optimal Transport (BOT), a symmetry-aware extension of traditional optimal transport (OT), designed to preserve intrinsic data structure when aligning datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OT methods often fail to account for symmetry-rich datasets, which overlook the coherence structure inherent in the data, leading to less meaningful alignments.

Method: Bispectral OT utilizes the bispectrum representation, a group Fourier invariant, to address symmetries in the data by removing variations caused by group actions while maintaining all signal structures.

Result: Empirical results on benchmark datasets show that Bispectral OT achieves higher class preservation and better alignment compared to naive OT methods, particularly in datasets involving visual symmetries.

Conclusion: Bispectral OT improves the alignment quality and ensures semantic coherence by addressing the shortcomings of traditional OT methods in symmetry-rich settings.

Abstract: Optimal transport (OT) is a widely used technique in machine learning,
graphics, and vision that aligns two distributions or datasets using their
relative geometry. In symmetry-rich settings, however, OT alignments based
solely on pairwise geometric distances between raw features can ignore the
intrinsic coherence structure of the data. We introduce Bispectral Optimal
Transport, a symmetry-aware extension of discrete OT that compares elements
using their representation using the bispectrum, a group Fourier invariant that
preserves all signal structure while removing only the variation due to group
actions. Empirically, we demonstrate that the transport plans computed with
Bispectral OT achieve greater class preservation accuracy than naive feature OT
on benchmark datasets transformed with visual symmetries, improving the quality
of meaningful correspondences that capture the underlying semantic label
structure in the dataset while removing nuisance variation not affecting class
or content.

*Athar Parvez,Muhammad Jawad Mufti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study evaluates two hybrid machine learning models, XGB-RF and SVM-LR, for diabetes risk prediction, finding XGB-RF consistently superior on performance metrics across both internal and external datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diabetes is a global health concern affecting over 537 million people, with projections showing significant growth. Machine learning techniques can improve early risk stratification, thus aiding in better disease management.

Method: The study builds two hybrid classifiers (XGB-RF and SVM-LR) using a leakage-safe pipeline with processes like encoding, imputation, scaling, and probability calibration. The models are assessed on internal datasets and validated externally using the PIMA cohort.

Result: XGB-RF demonstrated superior results on metrics like AUROC (~0.995 internally, ~0.990 externally) and AUPRC (~0.998 internally, ~0.959 externally), outperforming SVM-LR significantly. Thresholded metrics further confirmed XGB-RF's dominance.

Conclusion: XGB-RF is a robust and reliable tool for diabetes risk prediction, with consistent performance across datasets and acceptable calibration. The study recommends gradient-boosting hybrid approaches for prospective validation and clinical deployment.

Abstract: Background/Purpose: Diabetes affects over 537 million people worldwide and is
projected to reach 783 million by 2045. Early risk stratification can benefit
from machine learning. We compare two hybrid classifiers and assess their
generalizability on an external cohort.
  Methods: Two hybrids were built: (i) XGBoost + Random Forest (XGB-RF) and
(ii) Support Vector Machine + Logistic Regression (SVM-LR). A leakage-safe,
standardized pipeline (encoding, imputation, min-max scaling; SMOTE on training
folds only; probability calibration for SVM) was fit on the primary dataset and
frozen. Evaluation prioritized threshold-independent discrimination
(AUROC/AUPRC) and calibration (Brier, slope/intercept). External validation
used the PIMA cohort (N=768) with the frozen pipeline; any thresholded metrics
on PIMA were computed at the default rule tau = 0.5.
  Results: On the primary dataset (PR baseline = 0.50), XGB-RF achieved AUROC
~0.995 and AUPRC ~0.998, outperforming SVM-LR (AUROC ~0.978; AUPRC ~0.947). On
PIMA (PR baseline ~0.349), XGB-RF retained strong performance (AUROC ~0.990;
AUPRC ~0.959); SVM-LR was lower (AUROC ~0.963; AUPRC ~0.875). Thresholded
metrics on PIMA at tau = 0.5 were XGB-RF (Accuracy 0.960; Precision 0.941;
Recall 0.944; F1 0.942) and SVM-LR (Accuracy 0.900; Precision 0.855; Recall
0.858; F1 0.857).
  Conclusions: Across internal and external cohorts, XGB-RF consistently
dominated SVM-LR and exhibited smaller external attenuation on ROC/PR with
acceptable calibration. These results support gradient-boosting-based
hybridization as a robust, transferable approach for diabetes risk
stratification and motivate prospective, multi-site validation with
deployment-time threshold selection based on clinical trade-offs.

### [222] [Scaling Laws are Redundancy Laws](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20721)
*Yuda Bi,Vince D Calhoun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper formally explains deep learning scaling laws through data redundancy, showing power-law performance improvements are linked to data covariance spectral properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to mathematically explain the origins of scaling laws and their dependence on the scaling exponent in deep learning.

Method: The paper uses kernel regression to relate polynomial tails in the data covariance spectrum to excess risk power laws, deriving an expression for the scaling exponent based on data redundancy and spectral tail properties.

Result: The authors show that scaling laws depend on data redundancy, with specific relationships demonstrated across various model architectures and transformations. Their findings are universal for linearized NTK, feature-learning regimes, multi-modal mixtures, and more.

Conclusion: The paper provides a rigorous mathematical foundation for scaling laws, unifying empirical observations with theoretical insights and highlighting the importance of data redundancy in determining learning curve slopes.

Abstract: Scaling laws, a defining feature of deep learning, reveal a striking
power-law improvement in model performance with increasing dataset and model
size. Yet, their mathematical origins, especially the scaling exponent, have
remained elusive. In this work, we show that scaling laws can be formally
explained as redundancy laws. Using kernel regression, we show that a
polynomial tail in the data covariance spectrum yields an excess risk power law
with exponent alpha = 2s / (2s + 1/beta), where beta controls the spectral tail
and 1/beta measures redundancy. This reveals that the learning curve's slope is
not universal but depends on data redundancy, with steeper spectra accelerating
returns to scale. We establish the law's universality across boundedly
invertible transformations, multi-modal mixtures, finite-width approximations,
and Transformer architectures in both linearized (NTK) and feature-learning
regimes. This work delivers the first rigorous mathematical explanation of
scaling laws as finite-sample redundancy laws, unifying empirical observations
with theoretical foundations.

*Mingze Yuan,Pengfei Jin,Na Li,Quanzheng Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Physics-Informed Reward Fine-tuning (PIRF), a method for improving physics-informed generative models by optimizing sparse reward signals instead of relying on existing sampling techniques, which often introduce errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models, specifically diffusion models, often fail to adhere to physical laws despite their capabilities. The paper aims to address this limitation by proposing a new perspective for enforcing physical constraints.

Method: The paper frames physics-informed generative modeling as a sparse reward optimization problem and introduces PIRF, which avoids reliance on diffusion posterior sampling (DPS). PIRF employs trajectory-level rewards and backpropagation techniques, enhanced by layer-wise truncated backpropagation and weight-based regularization strategies.

Result: PIRF demonstrates superior performance across five PDE benchmarks in maintaining physical constraints while ensuring efficiency and sample fidelity.

Conclusion: The proposed PIRF method showcases the potential for utilizing reward fine-tuning to advance scientific generative modeling, overcoming limitations like training instability and inefficiency seen in prior methods.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong generative capabilities across
scientific domains, but often produce outputs that violate physical laws. We
propose a new perspective by framing physics-informed generation as a sparse
reward optimization problem, where adherence to physical constraints is treated
as a reward signal. This formulation unifies prior approaches under a
reward-based paradigm and reveals a shared bottleneck: reliance on diffusion
posterior sampling (DPS)-style value function approximations, which introduce
non-negligible errors and lead to training instability and inference
inefficiency. To overcome this, we introduce Physics-Informed Reward
Fine-tuning (PIRF), a method that bypasses value approximation by computing
trajectory-level rewards and backpropagating their gradients directly. However,
a naive implementation suffers from low sample efficiency and compromised data
fidelity. PIRF mitigates these issues through two key strategies: (1) a
layer-wise truncated backpropagation method that leverages the spatiotemporally
localized nature of physics-based rewards, and (2) a weight-based
regularization scheme that improves efficiency over traditional
distillation-based methods. Across five PDE benchmarks, PIRF consistently
achieves superior physical enforcement under efficient sampling regimes,
highlighting the potential of reward fine-tuning for advancing scientific
generative modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GWTF is a decentralized framework enabling crash-tolerant, collaborative training of LLMs across heterogeneous client nodes, reducing up to 45% training time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to democratize LLM training while addressing challenges like decentralized, client-driven computations, network instabilities, and node dynamics.

Method: Proposes a novel decentralized flow algorithm that ensures efficient microbatch routing and minimizes delay in training on distributed, heterogeneous systems.

Result: The framework shows up to 45% training time reduction in scenarios with high node churn and geographic distribution.

Conclusion: GWTF is a stepped-forward crash-resistant and practical solution for decentralized LLM training, helping harness diverse and distributed client resources effectively.

Abstract: Motivated by the emergence of large language models (LLMs) and the importance
of democratizing their training, we propose GWTF, the first crash tolerant
practical decentralized training framework for LLMs. Differently from existing
distributed and federated training frameworks, GWTF enables the efficient
collaborative training of a LLM on heterogeneous clients that volunteer their
resources. In addition, GWTF addresses node churn, i.e., clients joining or
leaving the system at any time, and network instabilities, i.e., network links
becoming unstable or unreliable. The core of GWTF is a novel decentralized flow
algorithm that finds the most effective routing that maximizes the number of
microbatches trained with the lowest possible delay. We extensively evaluate
GWTF on GPT-like and LLaMa-like models and compare it against the prior art.
Our results indicate that GWTF reduces the training time by up to 45% in
realistic and challenging scenarios that involve heterogeneous client nodes
distributed over 10 different geographic locations with a high node churn rate.

*Rohan Chauhan,Ioannis Panageas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the problem of estimating the inverse temperature parameter β of a truncated Ising model, where configurations are constrained by a k-SAT formula, using a single sample. An estimator is proposed with nearly O(n) computational time, showcasing strong consistency under specific constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop computationally efficient estimators for parameters of probabilistic models like truncated Ising models, which are constrained by k-SAT formulas and can model complex systems with dependencies.

Method: The paper introduces a nearly O(n)-time estimator for β estimation based on maximizing the pseudolikelihood function. Techniques are built on and extend recent frameworks used for probabilistic models with and without truncations.

Result: The estimator is shown to be O(Δ³/√n)-consistent with the true β* under certain conditions, such as bounded graph degree Δ and specific k-SAT relationships. The findings address computational and theoretical challenges in the model.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides an efficient and consistent estimator for β in truncated Ising models constrained by k-SAT formulas. It contributes to the understanding and computational tools for complex probabilistic models.

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating inverse temperature parameter $\beta$
of an $n$-dimensional truncated Ising model using a single sample. Given a
graph $G = (V,E)$ with $n$ vertices, a truncated Ising model is a probability
distribution over the $n$-dimensional hypercube $\{-1,1\}^n$ where each
configuration $\mathbf{\sigma}$ is constrained to lie in a truncation set $S
\subseteq \{-1,1\}^n$ and has probability $\Pr(\mathbf{\sigma}) \propto
\exp(\beta\mathbf{\sigma}^\top A\mathbf{\sigma})$ with $A$ being the adjacency
matrix of $G$. We adopt the recent setting of [Galanis et al. SODA'24], where
the truncation set $S$ can be expressed as the set of satisfying assignments of
a $k$-SAT formula. Given a single sample $\mathbf{\sigma}$ from a truncated
Ising model, with inverse parameter $\beta^*$, underlying graph $G$ of bounded
degree $\Delta$ and $S$ being expressed as the set of satisfying assignments of
a $k$-SAT formula, we design in nearly $O(n)$ time an estimator $\hat{\beta}$
that is $O(\Delta^3/\sqrt{n})$-consistent with the true parameter $\beta^*$ for
$k \gtrsim \log(d^2k)\Delta^3.$
  Our estimator is based on the maximization of the pseudolikelihood, a notion
that has received extensive analysis for various probabilistic models without
[Chatterjee, Annals of Statistics '07] or with truncation [Galanis et al. SODA
'24]. Our approach generalizes recent techniques from [Daskalakis et al. STOC
'19, Galanis et al. SODA '24], to confront the more challenging setting of the
truncated Ising model.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces SuperOffload, a system optimized for training large language models (LLMs) on Superchips, achieving up to 2.5x throughput improvement over state-of-the-art systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the advent of tightly coupled heterogeneous architectures in Superchips (integrating GPU and CPU), there is limited research on how such designs impact large language model (LLM) training. This work aims to explore this gap.

Method: The study introduces SuperOffload, an offloading system tailored for Superchips, leveraging techniques like adaptive weight offloading, bucketization repartitioning, Superchip-aware casting, speculative execution, and optimized Adam optimizer. It efficiently uses Hopper GPU, Grace CPU, and NVLink-C2C interconnect.

Result: SuperOffload achieves up to 2.5x throughput improvement compared to traditional offloading systems, supporting the training of up to 25B models on a single NVIDIA GH200 Superchip. It also supports ZeRO-style data parallelism and sequence parallelism for extended capabilities.

Conclusion: SuperOffload showcases the potential of tailored systems to effectively leverage Superchip architectures, unlocking significant performance gains in LLM training.

Abstract: The emergence of Superchips represents a significant advancement in
next-generation AI hardware. These Superchips employ a tightly coupled
heterogeneous architecture that integrates GPU and CPU on the same package,
which offers unprecedented computational power. However, there has been scant
research investigating how LLM training benefits from this new architecture. In
this work, for the first time, we study LLM training solutions based on
offloading for Superchips. We observe important differences between Superchips
and traditional loosely-coupled GPU-CPU architecture, which necessitate
revisiting prevailing assumptions about offloading. Based on that, we present
SuperOffload, a Superchip-centric offloading system that simultaneously uses
Hopper GPU, Grace CPU, and NVLink-C2C interconnect more efficiently.
SuperOffload accomplishes this via a combination of techniques, such as
adaptive weight offloading, bucketization repartitioning, Superchip-aware
casting, speculative execution, and a highly optimized Adam optimizer for Grace
CPUs. Our evaluation of SuperOffload on NVIDIA GH200 demonstrates up to 2.5x
throughput improvement compared to state-of-the-art offloading-based systems,
enabling training of up to 25B model on a single Superchip while achieving high
training throughput. We also extend SuperOffload with ZeRO-style data
parallelism and DeepSpeed-Ulysses sequence parallelism, enabling training of
13B model with sequence lengths up to 1 million tokens on 8 GH200 while
achieving 55% MFU.

*Zhengkang Guan,Kun Kuang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: E-CIT reduces computational complexity in causal discovery by dividing data subsets, performing tests, and aggregating results using stable distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current constraint-based causal discovery methods are computationally expensive due to high-cost conditional independence tests (CITs).

Method: Introduce the E-CIT framework, which uses divide-and-aggregate strategies to partition datasets, apply base CITs, and combine results with a stable distribution-based method.

Result: E-CIT lowers computational costs to a linear scale while maintaining theoretical consistency and showing robust performance, especially on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: E-CIT enhances the practicality of constraint-based causal discovery with efficient and theoretically sound methods.

Abstract: Constraint-based causal discovery relies on numerous conditional independence
tests (CITs), but its practical applicability is severely constrained by the
prohibitive computational cost, especially as CITs themselves have high time
complexity with respect to the sample size. To address this key bottleneck, we
introduce the Ensemble Conditional Independence Test (E-CIT), a general and
plug-and-play framework. E-CIT operates on an intuitive divide-and-aggregate
strategy: it partitions the data into subsets, applies a given base CIT
independently to each subset, and aggregates the resulting p-values using a
novel method grounded in the properties of stable distributions. This framework
reduces the computational complexity of a base CIT to linear in the sample size
when the subset size is fixed. Moreover, our tailored p-value combination
method offers theoretical consistency guarantees under mild conditions on the
subtests. Experimental results demonstrate that E-CIT not only significantly
reduces the computational burden of CITs and causal discovery but also achieves
competitive performance. Notably, it exhibits an improvement in complex testing
scenarios, particularly on real-world datasets.

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Neural FMM, a new neural network architecture combining the Fast Multipole Method (FMM) with machine learning to learn the Green's operator of Elliptic PDEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work seeks to explore the under-investigated integration of classical FMM, which efficiently computes long-ranged forces, with modern machine learning models.

Method: The authors designed the Neural FMM, blending the hierarchical computation structure of FMM with a learning framework for local and far-field interaction representations.

Result: No specific results are described in the abstract, but the method appears to effectively utilize FMM’s hierarchical structure for machine learning applications.

Conclusion: The approach establishes a new direction for combining classical numerical methods like FMM with machine learning to address physical problems such as learning the Green's operator.

Abstract: The Fast Multipole Method (FMM) is an efficient numerical algorithm for
computation of long-ranged forces in $N$-body problems within gravitational and
electrostatic fields. This method utilizes multipole expansions of the Green's
function inherent to the underlying dynamical systems. Despite its widespread
application in physics and engineering, the integration of FMM with modern
machine learning architectures remains underexplored. In this work, we propose
a novel neural network architecture, the Neural FMM, that integrates the
information flow of the FMM into a hierarchical machine learning framework for
learning the Green's operator of an Elliptic PDE. Our Neural FMM architecture
leverages a hierarchical computation flow of the FMM method to split up the
local and far-field interactions and efficiently learn their respective

### [229] [Inverse Reinforcement Learning Using Just Classification and a Few Regressions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21172)
*Lars van der Laan,Nathan Kallus,Aurélien Bibaut*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper revisits softmax Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), simplifying it into two supervised learning tasks: probabilistic classification and regression, offering a modular and efficient approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the complexity of existing IRL methods that hinder the adoption of modern function approximators like neural networks.

Method: Reduction of IRL to solving two supervised learning problems: estimating the behavior policy via probabilistic classification and applying iterative regression to solve a fixed-point equation.

Result: Presented a modular and simple method with finite-sample error bounds and empirically demonstrated superior or competitive performance compared to MaxEnt IRL.

Conclusion: The proposed approach simplifies IRL and facilitates the use of modern function approximation techniques, maintaining or improving performance.

Abstract: Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to explain observed behavior by
uncovering an underlying reward. In the maximum-entropy or
Gumbel-shocks-to-reward frameworks, this amounts to fitting a reward function
and a soft value function that together satisfy the soft Bellman consistency
condition and maximize the likelihood of observed actions. While this
perspective has had enormous impact in imitation learning for robotics and
understanding dynamic choices in economics, practical learning algorithms often
involve delicate inner-loop optimization, repeated dynamic programming, or
adversarial training, all of which complicate the use of modern, highly
expressive function approximators like neural nets and boosting. We revisit
softmax IRL and show that the population maximum-likelihood solution is
characterized by a linear fixed-point equation involving the behavior policy.
This observation reduces IRL to two off-the-shelf supervised learning problems:
probabilistic classification to estimate the behavior policy, and iterative
regression to solve the fixed point. The resulting method is simple and modular
across function approximation classes and algorithms. We provide a precise
characterization of the optimal solution, a generic oracle-based algorithm,
finite-sample error bounds, and empirical results showing competitive or
superior performance to MaxEnt IRL.

*Kamal Singh,Priyanka Rawat,Sami Marouani,Baptiste Jeudy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel interpretable QoE modeling for video streaming using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks on frequency-domain features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to optimize video streaming services by accurately modeling user experience and capturing complex feature relationships.

Method: Utilizing Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks combined with compact frequency-domain features for interpretable QoE modeling from raw time series data.

Result: Enhanced accuracy in predicting QoE compared to traditional black-box methods, coupled with improved model transparency.

Conclusion: The study offers a clear, interpretable, and effective mechanism for QoE prediction in video streaming applications.

Abstract: Quality of Experience (QoE) modeling is crucial for optimizing video
streaming services to capture the complex relationships between different
features and user experience. We propose a novel approach to QoE modeling in
video streaming applications using interpretable Machine Learning (ML)
techniques over raw time series data. Unlike traditional black-box approaches,
our method combines Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as an interpretable
readout on top of compact frequency-domain features, allowing us to capture
temporal information while retaining a transparent and explainable model. We
evaluate our method on popular datasets and demonstrate its enhanced accuracy
in QoE prediction, while offering transparency and interpretability.

### [231] [Closed-form $\ell_r$ norm scaling with data for overparameterized linear regression and diagonal linear networks under $\ell_p$ bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21181)
*Shuofeng Zhang,Ard Louis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the scaling behavior of $\ell_p$-biased interpolation norms for overparameterized linear regression, deriving unified predictions for norm behavior and thresholds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how parameter norms scale with sample size and determining which facets saturate versus grow is key for generalization in overparameterized models.

Method: The study utilizes dual-ray analysis to derive behavior predictions and investigates the dynamics in diagonal linear networks (DLNs) trained by gradient descent.

Result: Findings reveal an elbow transition point $n_\star$ and a universal threshold $r_\star=2(p-1)$ for norm scaling, with empirical validation in DLNs.

Conclusion: The insights bridge explicit and implicit biases, emphasizing the sensitive dependence of generalization proxies on chosen parameter norms.

Abstract: For overparameterized linear regression with isotropic Gaussian design and
minimum-$\ell_p$ interpolator $p\in(1,2]$, we give a unified, high-probability
characterization for the scaling of the family of parameter norms $ \\{ \lVert
\widehat{w_p} \rVert_r \\}_{r \in [1,p]} $ with sample size.
  We solve this basic, but unresolved question through a simple dual-ray
analysis, which reveals a competition between a signal *spike* and a *bulk* of
null coordinates in $X^\top Y$, yielding closed-form predictions for (i) a
data-dependent transition $n_\star$ (the "elbow"), and (ii) a universal
threshold $r_\star=2(p-1)$ that separates $\lVert \widehat{w_p} \rVert_r$'s
which plateau from those that continue to grow with an explicit exponent.
  This unified solution resolves the scaling of *all* $\ell_r$ norms within the
family $r\in [1,p]$ under $\ell_p$-biased interpolation, and explains in one
picture which norms saturate and which increase as $n$ grows.
  We then study diagonal linear networks (DLNs) trained by gradient descent. By
calibrating the initialization scale $\alpha$ to an effective
$p_{\mathrm{eff}}(\alpha)$ via the DLN separable potential, we show empirically
that DLNs inherit the same elbow/threshold laws, providing a predictive bridge
between explicit and implicit bias.
  Given that many generalization proxies depend on $\lVert \widehat {w_p}
\rVert_r$, our results suggest that their predictive power will depend
sensitively on which $l_r$ norm is used.

### [232] [Explicit and Effectively Symmetric Schemes for Neural SDEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20599)
*Daniil Shmelev,Cristopher Salvi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel class of stable, memory-efficient, and nearly reversible Runge-Kutta solvers for neural SDEs that address instability issues in previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve the training of neural stochastic differential equations (SDEs) by addressing memory inefficiency, slow evaluation, and instability issues in existing solver approaches.

Method: It introduces Explicit and Effectively Symmetric (EES) Runge-Kutta schemes that offer stability, near-reversibility, memory efficiency, and gradient accuracy for calculating solutions to neural SDEs.

Result: The proposed EES schemes demonstrate superior stability and reliability in numerical experiments compared to traditional solvers, validating their practical use for scalable and efficient neural SDE training.

Conclusion: The novel EES schemes overcome limitations of existing methods, providing a robust foundation for the efficient and accurate training of neural SDEs without imposing strict constraints on step size or model complexity.

Abstract: Backpropagation through (neural) SDE solvers is traditionally approached in
two ways: discretise-then-optimise, which offers accurate gradients but incurs
prohibitive memory costs due to storing the full computational graph (even when
mitigated by checkpointing); and optimise-then-discretise, which achieves
constant memory cost by solving an auxiliary backward SDE, but suffers from
slower evaluation and gradient approximation errors. Algebraically reversible
solvers promise both memory efficiency and gradient accuracy, yet existing
methods such as the Reversible Heun scheme are often unstable under complex
models and large step sizes. We address these limitations by introducing a
novel class of stable, near-reversible Runge--Kutta schemes for neural SDEs.
These Explicit and Effectively Symmetric (EES) schemes retain the benefits of
reversible solvers while overcoming their instability, enabling
memory-efficient training without severe restrictions on step size or model
complexity. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the superior
stability and reliability of our schemes, establishing them as a practical
foundation for scalable and accurate training of neural SDEs.

### [233] [No Prior, No Leakage: Revisiting Reconstruction Attacks in Trained Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21296)
*Yehonatan Refael,Guy Smorodinsky,Ofir Lindenbaum,Itay Safran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the weaknesses of training data reconstruction attacks on neural networks, showing that such leaks are unreliable without prior knowledge and suggesting a trade-off between privacy and model generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns about privacy breaches in neural networks caused by the potential reconstruction of training data from model parameters, and to understand the limitations of such attacks.

Method: The authors theoretically and empirically analyze existing reconstruction methods, proving that alternative data solutions can exist that are unrelated to the true training set. They also examine how model training intensity impacts susceptibility to such attacks.

Result: The study reveals that exact training data reconstruction occurs randomly, and that networks trained more extensively are less prone to successful reconstruction attacks due to stronger implicit bias conditions.

Conclusion: Reconstruction attacks are inherently unreliable unless prior data knowledge exists. Extensive model training increases privacy, contradicting earlier assumptions that implicit biases compromise security.

Abstract: The memorization of training data by neural networks raises pressing concerns
for privacy and security. Recent work has shown that, under certain conditions,
portions of the training set can be reconstructed directly from model
parameters. Some of these methods exploit implicit bias toward margin
maximization, suggesting that properties often regarded as beneficial for
generalization may actually compromise privacy. Yet despite striking empirical
demonstrations, the reliability of these attacks remains poorly understood and
lacks a solid theoretical foundation. In this work, we take a complementary
perspective: rather than designing stronger attacks, we analyze the inherent
weaknesses and limitations of existing reconstruction methods and identify
conditions under which they fail. We rigorously prove that, without
incorporating prior knowledge about the data, there exist infinitely many
alternative solutions that may lie arbitrarily far from the true training set,
rendering reconstruction fundamentally unreliable. Empirically, we further
demonstrate that exact duplication of training examples occurs only by chance.
Our results refine the theoretical understanding of when training set leakage
is possible and offer new insights into mitigating reconstruction attacks.
Remarkably, we demonstrate that networks trained more extensively, and
therefore satisfying implicit bias conditions more strongly -- are, in fact,
less susceptible to reconstruction attacks, reconciling privacy with the need
for strong generalization in this setting.

*Su Ann Low,Quentin Rommel,Kevin S. Miller,Adam J. Thorpe,Ufuk Topcu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces function encoders as a kernel-theoretic approach to learn adaptive and compact neural network representations for function spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To connect function encoders with kernel methods and investigate their scalability, adaptability to data structures, and potential for principled analysis of neural models.

Method: Two training algorithms are proposed: a progressive training approach that incrementally builds bases and a train-then-prune method. These leverage PCA principles to uncover intrinsic dimension and derive generalization bounds using Rademacher complexity and PAC-Bayes techniques.

Result: The methods achieve comparable accuracy with fewer basis functions on polynomial benchmarks and nonlinear dynamical systems, demonstrating efficiency and adaptability.

Conclusion: Function encoders can serve as scalable, adaptive, and theoretically principled neural predictors, bridging neural models and kernel methods effectively.

Abstract: Function encoders are a recent technique that learn neural network basis
functions to form compact, adaptive representations of Hilbert spaces of
functions. We show that function encoders provide a principled connection to
feature learning and kernel methods by defining a kernel through an inner
product of the learned feature map. This kernel-theoretic perspective explains
their ability to scale independently of dataset size while adapting to the
intrinsic structure of data, and it enables kernel-style analysis of neural
models. Building on this foundation, we develop two training algorithms that
learn compact bases: a progressive training approach that constructively grows
bases, and a train-then-prune approach that offers a computationally efficient
alternative after training. Both approaches use principles from PCA to reveal
the intrinsic dimension of the learned space. In parallel, we derive
finite-sample generalization bounds using Rademacher complexity and PAC-Bayes
techniques, providing inference time guarantees. We validate our approach on a
polynomial benchmark with a known intrinsic dimension, and on nonlinear
dynamical systems including a Van der Pol oscillator and a two-body orbital
model, demonstrating that the same accuracy can be achieved with substantially
fewer basis functions. This work suggests a path toward neural predictors with
kernel-level guarantees, enabling adaptable models that are both efficient and
principled at scale.

### [235] [MMG: Mutual Information Estimation via the MMSE Gap in Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20609)
*Longxuan Yu,Xing Shi,Xianghao Kong,Tong Jia,Greg Ver Steeg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for using denoising diffusion models to estimate mutual information (MI) in complex systems, outperforming traditional methods and demonstrating scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of estimating mutual information (MI) in complex systems, leveraging the recent breakthroughs in denoising diffusion models for density estimation.

Method: The proposed method uses the information-theoretic framework of denoising diffusion models. It equates MI to half the gap in MMSE between conditional and unconditional diffusion, integrated over all SNRs in the noising process, and uses adaptive importance sampling for scalability.

Result: The method passes self-consistency tests and outperforms traditional and score-based diffusion MI estimators, even at high MI values.

Conclusion: Utilizing denoising diffusion models provides a straightforward, scalable, and highly effective way to estimate mutual information.

Abstract: Mutual information (MI) is one of the most general ways to measure
relationships between random variables, but estimating this quantity for
complex systems is challenging. Denoising diffusion models have recently set a
new bar for density estimation, so it is natural to consider whether these
methods could also be used to improve MI estimation. Using the recently
introduced information-theoretic formulation of denoising diffusion models, we
show the diffusion models can be used in a straightforward way to estimate MI.
In particular, the MI corresponds to half the gap in the Minimum Mean Square
Error (MMSE) between conditional and unconditional diffusion, integrated over
all Signal-to-Noise-Ratios (SNRs) in the noising process. Our approach not only
passes self-consistency tests but also outperforms traditional and score-based
diffusion MI estimators. Furthermore, our method leverages adaptive importance
sampling to achieve scalable MI estimation, while maintaining strong
performance even when the MI is high.

*Daehee Lee,Dongsu Lee,TaeYoon Kwack,Wonje Choi,Honguk Woo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Skill Incremental Learning (SIL) expands an agent's skills over time for efficient downstream tasks but faces challenges in maintaining compatibility with existing skill-based policies. SIL-C is proposed as a framework to ensure compatibility and efficiency during incremental learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for an efficient way to expand and refine an agent's skill repertoire, ensuring skills are reusable and compatible with existing policies for downstream tasks.

Method: SIL-C utilizes a bilateral lazy learning-based mapping technique to dynamically align the subtask space referenced by policies with the skill space decoded into agent behaviors. Skills are selected based on trajectory distribution similarity.

Result: SIL-C was evaluated across various SIL scenarios and demonstrated its effectiveness in maintaining compatibility between evolving skills and existing policies, ensuring efficient learning.

Conclusion: SIL-C is a promising framework for ensuring skill-policy compatibility during incremental skill learning, facilitating better performance of downstream policies without requiring retraining or structural adaptation.

Abstract: Skill Incremental Learning (SIL) is the process by which an embodied agent
expands and refines its skill set over time by leveraging experience gained
through interaction with its environment or by the integration of additional
data. SIL facilitates efficient acquisition of hierarchical policies grounded
in reusable skills for downstream tasks. However, as the skill repertoire
evolves, it can disrupt compatibility with existing skill-based policies,
limiting their reusability and generalization. In this work, we propose SIL-C,
a novel framework that ensures skill-policy compatibility, allowing
improvements in incrementally learned skills to enhance the performance of
downstream policies without requiring policy re-training or structural
adaptation. SIL-C employs a bilateral lazy learning-based mapping technique to
dynamically align the subtask space referenced by policies with the skill space
decoded into agent behaviors. This enables each subtask, derived from the
policy's decomposition of a complex task, to be executed by selecting an
appropriate skill based on trajectory distribution similarity. We evaluate
SIL-C across diverse SIL scenarios and demonstrate that it maintains
compatibility between evolving skills and downstream policies while ensuring
efficiency throughout the learning process.

*Matthias Chung,Deepanshu Verma,Max Collins,Amit N. Subrahmanya,Varuni Katti Sastry,Vishwas Rao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Latent Twins introduces a unified framework to create hidden surrogates in latent spaces for analyzing and modeling mathematical systems, bridging representation learning and classical scientific modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the disconnect between separate pipelines of representation learning and algorithmic solution methods in scientific machine learning.

Method: Latent Twins develops a latent space surrogate for mathematical systems governed by operators, showcasing applications across ODEs, PDEs, and real-world noisy datasets.

Result: The framework demonstrates effective approximation properties and applications across diverse settings including canonical ODEs, PDE benchmarks, and geopotential reanalysis datasets.

Conclusion: Latent Twins provide scalable and interpretable surrogates compatible with scientific pipelines, bridging data-driven learning and classical modeling and enabling improved simulation and forecasting.

Abstract: Over the past decade, scientific machine learning has transformed the
development of mathematical and computational frameworks for analyzing,
modeling, and predicting complex systems. From inverse problems to numerical
PDEs, dynamical systems, and model reduction, these advances have pushed the
boundaries of what can be simulated. Yet they have often progressed in
parallel, with representation learning and algorithmic solution methods
evolving largely as separate pipelines. With \emph{Latent Twins}, we propose a
unifying mathematical framework that creates a hidden surrogate in latent space
for the underlying equations. Whereas digital twins mirror physical systems in
the digital world, Latent Twins mirror mathematical systems in a learned latent
space governed by operators. Through this lens, classical modeling, inversion,
model reduction, and operator approximation all emerge as special cases of a
single principle. We establish the fundamental approximation properties of
Latent Twins for both ODEs and PDEs and demonstrate the framework across three
representative settings: (i) canonical ODEs, capturing diverse dynamical
regimes; (ii) a PDE benchmark using the shallow-water equations, contrasting
Latent Twin simulations with DeepONet and forecasts with a 4D-Var baseline; and
(iii) a challenging real-data geopotential reanalysis dataset, reconstructing
and forecasting from sparse, noisy observations. Latent Twins provide a
compact, interpretable surrogate for solution operators that evaluate across
arbitrary time gaps in a single-shot, while remaining compatible with
scientific pipelines such as assimilation, control, and uncertainty
quantification. Looking forward, this framework offers scalable,
theory-grounded surrogates that bridge data-driven representation learning and
classical scientific modeling across disciplines.

### [238] [Training Task Reasoning LLM Agents for Multi-turn Task Planning via Single-turn Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20616)
*Hanjiang Hu,Changliu Liu,Na Li,Yebin Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in training large language models (LLMs) for complex multi-turn task planning by transforming these tasks into single-turn problems and introducing Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to overcome issues like sparse rewards, long credit assignment horizons, and computational costs associated with reinforcement learning in LLMs for multi-turn tasks.

Method: The authors propose redesigning multi-turn task planning into single-turn task reasoning, coupled with a policy optimization technique (GRPO), using dense rewards derived from expert trajectories.

Result: Experiments show their 1.5B parameter model outperforms larger models (up to 14B parameters) with superior success rates (70% for tasks with over 30 steps). It also demonstrates strong generalization to simpler subtasks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances the efficiency and scalability of LLMs for complex multi-turn planning, achieving high task completion rates and cross-task generalizability with smaller models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
knowledge acquisition, reasoning, and tool use, making them promising
candidates for autonomous agent applications. However, training LLM agents for
complex multi-turn task planning faces significant challenges, including sparse
episode-wise rewards, credit assignment across long horizons, and the
computational overhead of reinforcement learning in multi-turn interaction
settings. To this end, this paper introduces a novel approach that transforms
multi-turn task planning into single-turn task reasoning problems, enabling
efficient policy optimization through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
with dense and verifiable reward from expert trajectories. Our theoretical
analysis shows that GRPO improvement on single-turn task reasoning results in
higher multi-turn success probability under the minimal turns, as well as the
generalization to subtasks with shorter horizons. Experimental evaluation on
the complex task planning benchmark demonstrates that our 1.5B parameter model
trained with single-turn GRPO achieves superior performance compared to larger
baseline models up to 14B parameters, with success rates of 70% for
long-horizon planning tasks with over 30 steps. We also theoretically and
empirically validate the strong cross-task generalizability that the models
trained on complex tasks can lead to the successful completion of all simpler
subtasks.

*Yipu Zhang,Chengshuo Zhang,Ziyu Zhou,Gang Qu,Hao Zheng,Yuping Wang,Hui Shen,Hongwen Deng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Personalized Federated Dictionary Learning (PFedDL), a framework for overcoming data privacy constraints and site heterogeneity in multi-site fMRI studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address data privacy and non-IID challenges in multi-site fMRI studies, which hinder the development of generalizable models.

Method: PFedDL performs dictionary learning at each site, dividing the dictionary into a shared global component updated via federated aggregation and a local component for site-specific variability.

Result: Experiments on the ABIDE dataset show PFedDL's superiority in both accuracy and robustness across non-IID datasets over existing methods.

Conclusion: PFedDL effectively addresses data privacy and site heterogeneity in collaborative multi-site fMRI analysis, enabling improved model generalizability.

Abstract: Data privacy constraints pose significant challenges for large-scale
neuroimaging analysis, especially in multi-site functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) studies, where site-specific heterogeneity leads to
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. These factors
hinder the development of generalizable models. To address these challenges, we
propose Personalized Federated Dictionary Learning (PFedDL), a novel federated
learning framework that enables collaborative modeling across sites without
sharing raw data. PFedDL performs independent dictionary learning at each site,
decomposing each site-specific dictionary into a shared global component and a
personalized local component. The global atoms are updated via federated
aggregation to promote cross-site consistency, while the local atoms are
refined independently to capture site-specific variability, thereby enhancing
downstream analysis. Experiments on the ABIDE dataset demonstrate that PFedDL
outperforms existing methods in accuracy and robustness across non-IID
datasets.

### [240] [Investigating Modality Contribution in Audio LLMs for Music](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20641)
*Giovana Morais,Magdalena Fuentes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether Audio LLMs rely on real audio understanding or textual reasoning by using MM-SHAP (Shapley values) to quantify modality contributions, finding mixed results where audio contributes less overall but still guides some key event localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks suggest that Audio LLMs might rely more on textual reasoning rather than truly understanding audio, prompting the need to quantify the contribution of different input modalities in these models.

Method: The paper adapts the MM-SHAP framework, which uses Shapley values to assess the relative contribution of audio and text modalities to the model's predictions.

Result: On a music benchmark, the higher-accuracy model relied more on text overall but could still localize key sound events using audio input, indicating limited but significant audio contribution.

Conclusion: This study brings a new application of the MM-SHAP framework to evaluate Audio LLMs, paving the way for future research in explainable AI and the role of audio in multimodal systems.

Abstract: Audio Large Language Models (Audio LLMs) enable human-like conversation about
music, yet it is unclear if they are truly listening to the audio or just using
textual reasoning, as recent benchmarks suggest. This paper investigates this
issue by quantifying the contribution of each modality to a model's output. We
adapt the MM-SHAP framework, a performance-agnostic score based on Shapley
values that quantifies the relative contribution of each modality to a model's
prediction. We evaluate two models on the MuChoMusic benchmark and find that
the model with higher accuracy relies more on text to answer questions, but
further inspection shows that even if the overall audio contribution is low,
models can successfully localize key sound events, suggesting that audio is not
entirely ignored. Our study is the first application of MM-SHAP to Audio LLMs
and we hope it will serve as a foundational step for future research in
explainable AI and audio.

*Yiyuan Pan,Zhe Liu,Hesheng Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes CERMIC, a novel framework to optimize multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) exploration by calibrating intrinsic curiosity with multi-agent context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse rewards in MARL hinder effective exploration, and existing curiosity mechanisms fail by conflating randomness with novelty or applying a uniform bias.

Method: CERMIC dynamically calibrates agents' curiosity through inferred multi-agent context, filters noisy signals, and offers theoretically-grounded intrinsic rewards.

Result: Experiments on VMAS, Meltingpot, and SMACv2 show that CERMIC improves exploration performance compared to state-of-the-art algorithms in sparse-reward environments.

Conclusion: CERMIC enhances MARL exploration by leveraging context-aware intrinsic rewards, outperforming existing methods in complex, decentralized environments.

Abstract: Autonomous exploration in complex multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
with sparse rewards critically depends on providing agents with effective
intrinsic motivation. While artificial curiosity offers a powerful
self-supervised signal, it often confuses environmental stochasticity with
meaningful novelty. Moreover, existing curiosity mechanisms exhibit a uniform
novelty bias, treating all unexpected observations equally. However, peer
behavior novelty, which encode latent task dynamics, are often overlooked,
resulting in suboptimal exploration in decentralized, communication-free MARL
settings. To this end, inspired by how human children adaptively calibrate
their own exploratory behaviors via observing peers, we propose a novel
approach to enhance multi-agent exploration. We introduce CERMIC, a principled
framework that empowers agents to robustly filter noisy surprise signals and
guide exploration by dynamically calibrating their intrinsic curiosity with
inferred multi-agent context. Additionally, CERMIC generates
theoretically-grounded intrinsic rewards, encouraging agents to explore state
transitions with high information gain. We evaluate CERMIC on benchmark suites
including VMAS, Meltingpot, and SMACv2. Empirical results demonstrate that
exploration with CERMIC significantly outperforms SoTA algorithms in
sparse-reward environments.

### [242] [Theoretical Bounds for Stable In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20677)
*Tongxi Wang,Zhuoyang Xia*

TL;DR: This paper addresses the impact of prompt length on the reliability of in-context learning (ICL), introducing a theoretical lower bound and practical estimator tools for determining optimal prompt lengths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the reliability of in-context learning by analyzing and addressing the key sensitivity to prompt length in high-dimensional sub-Gaussian representations.

Method: The researchers derive a non-asymptotic lower bound based on spectral properties, propose a two-stage observable estimator, and introduce a one-shot calibration approach for estimating optimal prompt lengths.

Result: The proposed method provides a computable criterion and demonstrates strong empirical alignment with predicted thresholds across datasets, further closing the gap using a calibrated variant.

Conclusion: The study bridges theoretical insights with real-world deployment, connecting spectral coverage with stable ICL, thus improving the interpretability, reliability, and applicability of large-scale prompting systems.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is flexible but its reliability is highly sensitive
to prompt length. This paper establishes a non-asymptotic lower bound that
links the minimal number of demonstrations to ICL stability under fixed
high-dimensional sub-Gaussian representations. The bound gives explicit
sufficient conditions in terms of spectral properties of the covariance,
providing a computable criterion for practice. Building on this analysis, we
propose a two-stage observable estimator with a one-shot calibration that
produces practitioner-ready prompt-length estimates without distributional
priors. Experiments across diverse datasets, encoders, and generators show
close alignment between the predicted thresholds and empirical knee-points,
with the theory acting as a conservative but reliable upper bound; the
calibrated variant further tightens this gap. These results connect spectral
coverage to stable ICL, bridge theory and deployment, and improve the
interpretability and reliability of large-scale prompting in realistic
finite-sample regimes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores privacy risks in federated learning (FL) when collaboratively fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). It identifies vulnerabilities that expose training data, proposes new attack methods, and evaluates mitigation techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Organizations aim to adapt LLMs to specific domains collaboratively, but data-sharing restrictions hinder centralized fine-tuning. FL offers a privacy-preserving alternative yet raises privacy concerns.

Method: Extensive experiments show that attackers can extract training data from the global model in FL. Additionally, the authors introduce a novel attack method that leverages global model updates to intensify privacy leakage.

Result: The study reveals that privacy leakage persists in FL despite its intended safeguards, with risks escalating as model size increases. The authors evaluate several privacy-preserving techniques to address these concerns.

Conclusion: Privacy risks exist even in FL for LLMs, emphasizing the need for robust countermeasures. The paper offers practical solutions to reduce these risks while balancing model performance.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with local data is a widely adopted
approach for organizations seeking to adapt LLMs to their specific domains.
Given the shared characteristics in data across different organizations, the
idea of collaboratively fine-tuning an LLM using data from multiple sources
presents an appealing opportunity. However, organizations are often reluctant
to share local data, making centralized fine-tuning impractical. Federated
learning (FL), a privacy-preserving framework, enables clients to retain local
data while sharing only model parameters for collaborative training, offering a
potential solution. While fine-tuning LLMs on centralized datasets risks data
leakage through next-token prediction, the iterative aggregation process in FL
results in a global model that encapsulates generalized knowledge, which some
believe protects client privacy. In this paper, however, we present
contradictory findings through extensive experiments. We show that attackers
can still extract training data from the global model, even using
straightforward generation methods, with leakage increasing as the model size
grows. Moreover, we introduce an enhanced attack strategy tailored to FL, which
tracks global model updates during training to intensify privacy leakage. To
mitigate these risks, we evaluate privacy-preserving techniques in FL,
including differential privacy, regularization-constrained updates and adopting
LLMs with safety alignment. Our results provide valuable insights and practical
guidelines for reducing privacy risks when training LLMs with FL.

Motivation: Current deep learning models for predicting drug-target binding affinity lack geometric regularization and robust generalization across chemical space and time, necessitating new methods.

Method: FIRM-DTI employs a FiLM layer to condition molecular embeddings on protein embeddings and enforces metric structure using a triplet loss. It uses an RBF regression head to predict affinity based on embedding distances.

Result: FIRM-DTI achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DTI-DG benchmark, validated by comprehensive ablation studies and evaluations in out-of-domain settings.

Conclusion: Conditioning molecular embeddings on protein embeddings and incorporating metric learning significantly improve the robustness and interpretability of drug-target affinity predictions.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of drug-target binding affinity can accelerate drug
discovery by prioritizing promising compounds before costly wet-lab screening.
While deep learning has advanced this task, most models fuse ligand and protein
representations via simple concatenation and lack explicit geometric
regularization, resulting in poor generalization across chemical space and
time. We introduce FIRM-DTI, a lightweight framework that conditions molecular
embeddings on protein embeddings through a feature-wise linear modulation
(FiLM) layer and enforces metric structure with a triplet loss. An RBF
regression head operating on embedding distances yields smooth, interpretable
affinity predictions. Despite its modest size, FIRM-DTI achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the Therapeutics Data Commons DTI-DG benchmark,
as demonstrated by an extensive ablation study and out-of-domain evaluation.
Our results underscore the value of conditioning and metric learning for robust
drug-target affinity prediction.

### [245] [CE-GPPO: Controlling Entropy via Gradient-Preserving Clipping Policy Optimization in Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20712)
*Zhenpeng Su,Leiyu Pan,Minxuan Lv,Yuntao Li,Wenping Hu,Fuzheng Zhang,Kun Gai,Guorui Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CE-GPPO, an algorithm to improve reinforcement learning for language models by addressing entropy instability and reintroducing gradients from discarded tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning faces challenges in managing entropy dynamics in large language models, particularly due to the clipping mechanism in existing methods like PPO which discards gradients from low-probability tokens.

Method: Proposes CE-GPPO, which reintroduces gradients from discarded low-probability tokens in a controlled manner to balance exploration and exploitation while stabilizing entropy.

Result: CE-GPPO shows superior performance compared to baseline methods in mathematical reasoning tasks across various model scales.

Conclusion: CE-GPPO effectively mitigates entropy instability, achieving better exploration-exploitation balance and outperforming standard approaches in key benchmarks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a powerful paradigm for optimizing
large language models (LLMs) to handle complex reasoning tasks. A core
challenge in this process lies in managing policy entropy, which reflects the
balance between exploration and exploitation during training. Existing methods,
such as proximal policy optimization (PPO) and its variants, discard valuable
gradient signals from low-probability tokens due to the clipping mechanism. We
systematically analyze the entropy dynamics and reveal that these clipped
tokens play a critical yet overlooked role in regulating entropy evolution. We
propose \textbf{C}ontrolling \textbf{E}ntropy via
\textbf{G}radient-\textbf{P}reserving \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization
(CE-GPPO), a novel algorithm that reintroduces gradients from clipped tokens in
native PPO in a gentle and bounded manner. By controlling the magnitude of
gradients from tokens outside the clipping interval, CE-GPPO is able to achieve
an exploration-exploitation trade-off. We provide theoretical justification and
empirical evidence showing that CE-GPPO effectively mitigates entropy
instability. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show
that CE-GPPO consistently outperforms strong baselines across different model
scales.

*Alston Lo,Connor W. Coley,Wojciech Matusik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SynGA is a genetic algorithm focused on synthesizable molecular design, utilizing custom operators and fitness functions for effective analog search and property optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Genetic algorithms are productive in molecular design, but ensuring synthesizability is critical for practical application.

Method: SynGA employs custom crossover and mutation operators to constrain molecular designs to synthesizable space, combined with machine learning for advanced performance.

Result: Effective synthesizable analog search and property optimization across multiple objectives; state-of-the-art performance when paired with machine learning filtering.

Conclusion: SynGA offers both standalone and integrative solutions for synthesis-aware workflows in molecular design.

Abstract: Inspired by the effectiveness of genetic algorithms and the importance of
synthesizability in molecular design, we present SynGA, a simple genetic
algorithm that operates directly over synthesis routes. Our method features
custom crossover and mutation operators that explicitly constrain it to
synthesizable molecular space. By modifying the fitness function, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of SynGA on a variety of design tasks, including
synthesizable analog search and sample-efficient property optimization, for
both 2D and 3D objectives. Furthermore, by coupling SynGA with a machine
learning-based filter that focuses the building block set, we boost SynGA to
state-of-the-art performance. For property optimization, this manifests as a
model-based variant SynGBO, which employs SynGA and block filtering in the
inner loop of Bayesian optimization. Since SynGA is lightweight and enforces
synthesizability by construction, our hope is that SynGA can not only serve as
a strong standalone baseline but also as a versatile module that can be
incorporated into larger synthesis-aware workflows in the future.

*Zhenshan Zhang,Xueping Zhang,Yechen Wang,Liwei Jin,Ming Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates how audio watermarking, used for copyright protection, affects spoofing countermeasures for speech-based applications while proposing a solution to address performance degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the unexplored impact of commonly used audio watermarking techniques on the effectiveness of anti-spoofing systems in speech applications, ensuring security and accuracy.

Method: The authors developed a Watermark-Spoofing dataset by augmenting existing spoofing datasets with diverse audio watermarking methods. They also introduced the Knowledge-Preserving Watermark Learning (KPWL) framework to mitigate watermark effects on anti-spoofing performance.

Result: Experiments indicated that audio watermarking adversely affects anti-spoofing performance, with denser watermarking leading to higher Equal Error Rates (EERs). KPWL successfully mitigates watermark-induced performance shifts.

Conclusion: The study identifies audio watermarking as a significant factor causing domain shifts in anti-spoofing systems and introduces protocols for designing watermark-resilient solutions for securing speech-based systems.

Abstract: This paper presents the first study on the impact of audio watermarking on
spoofing countermeasures. While anti-spoofing systems are essential for
securing speech-based applications, the influence of widely used audio
watermarking, originally designed for copyright protection, remains largely
unexplored. We construct watermark-augmented training and evaluation datasets,
named the Watermark-Spoofing dataset, by applying diverse handcrafted and
neural watermarking methods to existing anti-spoofing datasets. Experiments
show that watermarking consistently degrades anti-spoofing performance, with
higher watermark density correlating with higher Equal Error Rates (EERs). To
mitigate this, we propose the Knowledge-Preserving Watermark Learning (KPWL)
framework, enabling models to adapt to watermark-induced shifts while
preserving their original-domain spoofing detection capability. These findings
reveal audio watermarking as a previously overlooked domain shift and establish
the first benchmark for developing watermark-resilient anti-spoofing systems.

### [248] [Measuring LLM Sensitivity in Transformer-based Tabular Data Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20768)
*Maria F. Davila R,Azizjon Turaev,Wolfram Wingerath*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the trade-offs between computational efficiency and data quality in Transformer-based Tabular Data Synthesis (TDS) tools, focusing on hyperparameter sensitivity and comparing GReaT to REaLTabFormer across different dataset sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the computational inefficiency of Transformer-based models for synthetic tabular data, while maintaining data quality and utility for real-world applications.

Method: A sensitivity analysis was conducted across 10 model setups of GReaT and REaLTabFormer, varying architecture type and depth. Evaluation dimensions included runtime, ML utility, and real data distribution similarity using experiments on four real-world datasets.

Result: Findings indicate that runtime is proportional to hyperparameter size, with GReaT generally outperforming REaLTabFormer in runtime, especially for smaller datasets. For large datasets, however, REaLTabFormer achieves stronger utility and similarity due to its lightweight LLM configurations.

Conclusion: REaLTabFormer strikes the best balance between data quality and computational demands, though its runtime remains higher than GReaT. Future advances could improve efficiency, but only to a certain extent.

Abstract: Synthetic tabular data is used for privacy-preserving data sharing and
data-driven model development. Its effectiveness, however, depends heavily on
the used Tabular Data Synthesis (TDS) tool. Recent studies have shown that
Transformer-based models outperform other state-of-the-art models such as
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion models in terms of data
quality. However, Transformer-based models also come with high computational
costs, making them sometimes unfeasible for end users with prosumer hardware.
This study presents a sensitivity assessment on how the choice of
hyperparameters, such as number of layers or hidden dimension affects the
quality of the resultant synthetic data and the computational performance. It
is performed across two tools, GReaT and REaLTabFormer, evaluating 10 model
setups that vary in architecture type and depth. We assess the sensitivity on
three dimensions: runtime, machine learning (ML) utility, and similarity to
real data distributions. Experiments were conducted on four real-world
datasets. Our findings reveal that runtime is proportional to the number of
hyperparameters, with shallower configurations completing faster. GReaT
consistently achieves lower runtimes than REaLTabFormer, and only on the
largest dataset they have comparable runtime. For small datasets, both tools
achieve synthetic data with high utility and optimal similarity, but on larger
datasets only REaLTabFormer sustains strong utility and similarity. As a
result, REaLTabFormer with lightweight LLMs provides the best balance, since it
preserves data quality while reducing computational requirements. Nonetheless,
its runtime remains higher than that of GReaT and other TDS tools, suggesting
that efficiency gains are possible but only up to a certain level.

*Gawon Lee,Hanbyeol Park,Minseop Kim,Dohee Kim,Hyerim Bae*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the limitations of MLP in time-series forecasting by combining it with CNNs to capture both long-term trends and local variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time-series data often include complex non-stationary behaviors such as changing trends and irregularities, which MLP alone struggles to model accurately.

Method: The authors propose integrating MLP for modeling long-term dependencies with a novel CNN architecture, IConv, for capturing local patterns and inter-channel relationships.

Result: Experiments on diverse time-series datasets demonstrate that the proposed hybrid model outperforms existing methods in multivariate time-series forecasting.

Conclusion: Combining MLP and CNN architectures provides an effective and computationally efficient solution for modeling non-stationary time-series data.

Abstract: Real-world time-series data often exhibit non-stationarity, including
changing trends, irregular seasonality, and residuals. In terms of changing
trends, recently proposed multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-based models have shown
excellent performance owing to their computational efficiency and ability to
capture long-term dependency. However, the linear nature of MLP architectures
poses limitations when applied to channels with diverse distributions,
resulting in local variations such as seasonal patterns and residual components
being ignored. However, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can effectively
incorporate these variations. To resolve the limitations of MLP, we propose
combining them with CNNs. The overall trend is modeled using an MLP to consider
long-term dependencies. The CNN uses diverse kernels to model fine-grained
local patterns in conjunction with MLP trend predictions. To focus on modeling
local variation, we propose IConv, a novel convolutional architecture that
processes the temporal dependency channel independently and considers the
inter-channel relationship through distinct layers. Independent channel
processing enables the modeling of diverse local temporal dependencies and the
adoption of a large kernel size. Distinct inter-channel considerations reduce
computational cost. The proposed model is evaluated through extensive
experiments on time-series datasets. The results reveal the superiority of the
proposed method for multivariate time-series forecasting.

*Abhishek Moturu,Anna Goldenberg,Babak Taati*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LiLAW proposes a method to adaptively weight training samples based on their difficulty, significantly improving neural network performance in noisy environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of training deep neural networks with noisy labels and heterogeneous data.

Method: LiLAW dynamically adjusts sample loss weights using three learnable parameters based on their difficulty levels, employing a gradient descent update on the validation set.

Result: LiLAW enhances model performance across varied datasets, architectures, and noise settings without heavy reliance on data augmentation or complex regularization techniques.

Conclusion: LiLAW is computationally efficient, practical, and improves generalization and robustness in neural network training.

Abstract: Training deep neural networks in the presence of noisy labels and data
heterogeneity is a major challenge. We introduce Lightweight Learnable Adaptive
Weighting (LiLAW), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the loss weight of
each training sample based on its evolving difficulty level, categorized as
easy, moderate, or hard. Using only three learnable parameters, LiLAW
adaptively prioritizes informative samples throughout training by updating
these weights using a single mini-batch gradient descent step on the validation
set after each training mini-batch, without requiring excessive hyperparameter
tuning or a clean validation set. Extensive experiments across multiple general
and medical imaging datasets, noise levels and types, loss functions, and
architectures with and without pretraining demonstrate that LiLAW consistently
enhances performance, even in high-noise environments. It is effective without
heavy reliance on data augmentation or advanced regularization, highlighting
its practicality. It offers a computationally efficient solution to boost model
generalization and robustness in any neural network training setup.

### [251] [Aligning Inductive Bias for Data-Efficient Generalization in State Space Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20789)
*Qiyu Chen,Guozhang Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve the sample efficiency of large-scale sequence models like SSMs by aligning their inductive bias with task-specific characteristics through Task-Dependent Initialization (TDI).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The finite availability of high-quality data challenges the scalability of large models, and improving data efficiency is crucial for advancing model performance.

Method: The authors formalize the inductive bias of linear time-invariant SSMs using an SSM-induced kernel and propose "Task-Dependent Initialization (TDI)," which matches the model's spectral properties with the task requirements before training.

Result: The proposed approach, TDI, showed significant improvements in generalization and sample efficiency, particularly in settings with limited data, across various real-world benchmarks.

Conclusion: The study introduces a theoretically grounded and practical method for enhancing data efficiency in sequence models, contributing to sustainable advancements in model scaling.

Abstract: The remarkable success of large-scale models is fundamentally tied to scaling
laws, yet the finite nature of high-quality data presents a looming challenge.
One of the next frontiers in modeling is data efficiency: the ability to learn
more from less. A model's inductive bias is a critical lever for this, but
foundational sequence models like State Space Models (SSMs) rely on a fixed
bias. This fixed prior is sample-inefficient when a task's underlying structure
does not match. In this work, we introduce a principled framework to solve this
problem. We first formalize the inductive bias of linear time-invariant SSMs
through an SSM-induced kernel, mathematically and empirically proving its
spectrum is directly governed by the model's frequency response. Further, we
propose a method of Task-Dependent Initialization (TDI): power spectrum
matching, a fast and efficient method that aligns the model's inductive bias
with the task's spectral characteristics before large-scale training. Our
experiments on a diverse set of real-world benchmarks show that TDI
significantly improves generalization and sample efficiency, particularly in
low-data regimes. This work provides a theoretical and practical tool to create
more data-efficient models, a crucial step towards sustainable scaling.

*Zhengxiao Li,Liming Lu,Xu Zheng,Siyuan Liang,Zhenghan Chen,Yongbin Zhou,Shuchao Pang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes FERD, a fairness-enhanced robustness distillation framework, addressing robustness disparities across categories for data-free robustness distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data-free robustness distillation methods prioritize overall robustness but neglect robust fairness, leading to variability in robustness across categories.

Method: FERD adjusts adversarial example proportions using robustness-guided class reweighting for less robust categories and balances feature-level predictions with Fairness-Aware Examples. Uniform-Target Adversarial Examples are also introduced to evenly distribute attack targets.

Result: Extensive testing on datasets like CIFAR-10 shows FERD outperforms previous methods, improving worst-class robustness by 15.1% under FGSM and 6.4% under AutoAttack using MobileNet-V2.

Conclusion: FERD effectively addresses fairness and robustness in data-free robustness distillation, providing more equitable and robust results under diverse attacks.

Abstract: Data-Free Robustness Distillation (DFRD) aims to transfer the robustness from
the teacher to the student without accessing the training data. While existing
methods focus on overall robustness, they overlook the robust fairness issues,
leading to severe disparity of robustness across different categories. In this
paper, we find two key problems: (1) student model distilled with equal class
proportion data behaves significantly different across distinct categories; and
(2) the robustness of student model is not stable across different attacks
target. To bridge these gaps, we present the first Fairness-Enhanced data-free
Robustness Distillation (FERD) framework to adjust the proportion and
distribution of adversarial examples. For the proportion, FERD adopts a
robustness-guided class reweighting strategy to synthesize more samples for the
less robust categories, thereby improving robustness of them. For the
distribution, FERD generates complementary data samples for advanced robustness
distillation. It generates Fairness-Aware Examples (FAEs) by enforcing a
uniformity constraint on feature-level predictions, which suppress the
dominance of class-specific non-robust features, providing a more balanced
representation across all categories. Then, FERD constructs Uniform-Target
Adversarial Examples (UTAEs) from FAEs by applying a uniform target class
constraint to avoid biased attack directions, which distribute the attack
targets across all categories and prevents overfitting to specific vulnerable
categories. Extensive experiments on three public datasets show that FERD
achieves state-of-the-art worst-class robustness under all adversarial attack
(e.g., the worst-class robustness under FGSM and AutoAttack are improved by
15.1\% and 6.4\% using MobileNet-V2 on CIFAR-10), demonstrating superior
performance in both robustness and fairness aspects.

*Hwa Hui Tew,Junn Yong Loo,Yee-Fan Tan,Xinyu Tang,Hernando Ombao,Fuad Noman,Raphael C. -W. Phan,Chee-Ming Ting*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: T2I-Diff is a novel fMRI generation method leveraging time-frequency representation and classifier-free diffusion to overcome limitations in synthetic neuroimaging data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-fidelity fMRI samples, essential for brain analysis, are resource-intensive, and existing generative models fail to capture complex BOLD signal dynamics.

Method: The framework converts BOLD signals into spectrograms via Fourier transform, uses classifier-free diffusion to generate frequency spectrograms, and restores BOLD signals through inverse transforms.

Result: T2I-Diff improved accuracy and generalization in brain network classification tasks compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: T2I-Diff offers a promising approach for generating realistic fMRI data that supports advanced neuroimaging analysis.

Abstract: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is an advanced neuroimaging
method that enables in-depth analysis of brain activity by measuring dynamic
changes in the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals. However, the
resource-intensive nature of fMRI data acquisition limits the availability of
high-fidelity samples required for data-driven brain analysis models. While
modern generative models can synthesize fMRI data, they often underperform
because they overlook the complex non-stationarity and nonlinear BOLD dynamics.
To address these challenges, we introduce T2I-Diff, an fMRI generation
framework that leverages time-frequency representation of BOLD signals and
classifier-free denoising diffusion. Specifically, our framework first converts
BOLD signals into windowed spectrograms via a time-dependent Fourier transform,
capturing both the underlying temporal dynamics and spectral evolution.
Subsequently, a classifier-free diffusion model is trained to generate
class-conditioned frequency spectrograms, which are then reverted to BOLD
signals via inverse Fourier transforms. Finally, we validate the efficacy of
our approach by demonstrating improved accuracy and generalization in
downstream fMRI-based brain network classification.

TL;DR: This paper presents CaTS-Bench, a real-world benchmark for time series captioning tasks, with diverse datasets, advanced captioning generation, and enhanced evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of realistic and complex benchmarks for time series captioning, which requires numerical reasoning, trend interpretation, and contextual understanding.

Method: Introduces CaTS-Bench with over 465k training and 105k test timestamps derived from real-world datasets, contextual metadata, visual representations, and captions generated through a scalable LLM pipeline refined for accuracy and style.

Result: CaTS-Bench includes diverse datasets, an LLM-based scalable pipeline for caption generation verified for accuracy, and offers 460 multiple-choice questions for deeper reasoning, alongside new evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: CaTS-Bench establishes a robust benchmark and provides tools for advancing research in time series captioning and foundation models.

Abstract: Time series captioning, the task of describing numeric time series in natural
language, requires numerical reasoning, trend interpretation, and contextual
understanding. Existing benchmarks, however, often rely on synthetic data or
overly simplistic captions, and typically neglect metadata and visual
representations. To close this gap, we introduce CaTS-Bench, the first
large-scale, real-world benchmark for Context-aware Time Series captioning.
CaTS-Bench is derived from 11 diverse datasets reframed as captioning and Q&A
tasks, comprising roughly 465k training and 105k test timestamps. Each sample
includes a numeric series segment, contextual metadata, a line-chart image, and
a caption. A key contribution of this work is the scalable pipeline used to
generate reference captions: while most references are produced by an oracle
LLM and verified through factual checks, human indistinguishability studies,
and diversity analyses, we also provide a human-revisited subset of 579 test
captions, refined from LLM outputs to ensure accuracy and human-like style.
Beyond captioning, CaTS-Bench offers 460 multiple-choice questions targeting
deeper aspects of time series reasoning. We further propose new tailored
evaluation metrics and benchmark leading VLMs, highlighting both their
strengths and persistent limitations. Together, these contributions establish
CaTS-Bench and its captioning pipeline as a reliable and extensible foundation
for future research at the intersection of time series analysis and foundation
models.

*Keitaro Sakamoto,Issei Sato*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explains late training phenomena like grokking and information bottleneck in deep learning using the concept of neural collapse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand late-phase phenomena such as grokking and the information bottleneck principle in deep neural network training.

Method: The authors analyze the training dynamics of neural collapse and its role in late-phase phenomena, using theoretical insights and empirical validation on multiple datasets and architectures.

Result: The study shows that the time scale differences between training set fitting and neural collapse dynamics explain late training behaviors. Neural collapse is linked to contracting within-class variance, affecting grokking and the information bottleneck.

Conclusion: Late-phase phenomena in deep learning training can be explained through neural collapse dynamics, with potential to unify these seemingly distinct behaviors.

Abstract: The training dynamics of deep neural networks often defy expectations, even
as these models form the foundation of modern machine learning. Two prominent
examples are grokking, where test performance improves abruptly long after the
training loss has plateaued, and the information bottleneck principle, where
models progressively discard input information irrelevant to the prediction
task as training proceeds. However, the mechanisms underlying these phenomena
and their relations remain poorly understood. In this work, we present a
unified explanation of such late-phase phenomena through the lens of neural
collapse, which characterizes the geometry of learned representations. We show
that the contraction of population within-class variance is a key factor
underlying both grokking and information bottleneck, and relate this measure to
the neural collapse measure defined on the training set. By analyzing the
dynamics of neural collapse, we show that distinct time scales between fitting
the training set and the progression of neural collapse account for the
behavior of the late-phase phenomena. Finally, we validate our theoretical
findings on multiple datasets and architectures.

*Jiaqi Tang,Yinsong Xu,Yang Liu,Qingchao Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study addresses modality competition in multi-modal fusion by introducing a two-stage training framework involving unimodal training before joint training, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Failures in multi-modal fusion due to dominant modalities led to the need for an approach that balances competitive strength and synergistic learning.

Method: Proposes the Effective Competitive Strength (ECS) metric, a mutual information-based proxy, and a FastPID solver combined with an asynchronous controller for dynamic balance and initial state optimization.

Result: The method demonstrated superior performance across benchmarks, resolving modality competition issues effectively.

Conclusion: Shaping models' initial state through unimodal training unlocks synergistic multi-modal fusion and mitigates competition challenges.

Abstract: Multi-modal fusion often suffers from modality competition during joint
training, where one modality dominates the learning process, leaving others
under-optimized. Overlooking the critical impact of the model's initial state,
most existing methods address this issue during the joint learning stage. In
this study, we introduce a two-stage training framework to shape the initial
states through unimodal training before the joint training. First, we propose
the concept of Effective Competitive Strength (ECS) to quantify a modality's
competitive strength. Our theoretical analysis further reveals that properly
shaping the initial ECS by unimodal training achieves a provably tighter error
bound. However, ECS is computationally intractable in deep neural networks. To
bridge this gap, we develop a framework comprising two core components: a
fine-grained computable diagnostic metric and an asynchronous training
controller. For the metric, we first prove that mutual information(MI) is a
principled proxy for ECS. Considering MI is induced by per-modality marginals
and thus treats each modality in isolation, we further propose FastPID, a
computationally efficient and differentiable solver for partial information
decomposition, which decomposes the joint distribution's information into
fine-grained measurements: modality-specific uniqueness, redundancy, and
synergy. Guided by these measurements, our asynchronous controller dynamically
balances modalities by monitoring uniqueness and locates the ideal initial
state to start joint training by tracking peak synergy. Experiments on diverse
benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.
Our work establishes that shaping the pre-fusion models' initial state is a
powerful strategy that eases competition before it starts, reliably unlocking
synergistic multi-modal fusion.

TL;DR: MOIRA is a method to integrate incomplete multi-omics data, allowing robust analysis by aligning representations and adaptively aggregating them in a shared embedding space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-omics data provide valuable insights into metabolism and disease but are often incomplete, hindering integrative analysis.

Method: MOIRA uses representation alignment and adaptive aggregation to process incomplete omics data and projects them into a shared embedding space with a learnable weighting mechanism.

Result: MOIRA outperformed existing methods in Alzheimer’s Disease-related analysis on the ROSMAP dataset and identified biologically relevant biomarkers.

Conclusion: The approach shows promise for enhancing analysis of heterogeneous omics data and identifying disease biomarkers despite missing data.

Abstract: Multi-omics data capture complex biomolecular interactions and provide
insights into metabolism and disease. However, missing modalities hinder
integrative analysis across heterogeneous omics. To address this, we present
MOIRA (Multi-Omics Integration with Robustness to Absent modalities), an early
integration method enabling robust learning from incomplete omics data via
representation alignment and adaptive aggregation. MOIRA leverages all samples,
including those with missing modalities, by projecting each omics dataset onto
a shared embedding space where a learnable weighting mechanism fuses them.
Evaluated on the Religious Order Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP)
dataset for Alzheimer's Disease (AD), MOIRA outperformed existing approaches,
and further ablation studies confirmed modality-wise contributions. Feature
importance analysis revealed AD-related biomarkers consistent with prior
literature, highlighting the biological relevance of our approach.

### [258] [Causal Time Series Generation via Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20846)
*Yutong Xia,Chang Xu,Yuxuan Liang,Qingsong Wen,Roger Zimmermann,Jiang Bian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces causal time series generation (TSG) and proposes a diffusion-based framework, CaTSG, for generating realistic observational, interventional, and counterfactual sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current conditional TSG models only focus on observed correlations and neglect unobserved confounding, limiting their capability to generate sequences under interventions or counterfactual scenarios.

Method: The authors offer a causal framework called CaTSG, employing backdoor-adjusted guidance and causal score functions. These are derived via the abduction-action-prediction procedure to support observational, interventional, and counterfactual tasks.

Result: CaTSG demonstrates superior fidelity in sequence generation and uniquely supports both interventional and counterfactual generation, outperforming existing baselines in experiments on synthetic and real-world data.

Conclusion: The work introduces causal TSG as a significant extension of traditional TSG, providing proof-of-concept through CaTSG. It paves the way for reliable simulation of sequences in interventional and counterfactual scenarios.

Abstract: Time series generation (TSG) synthesizes realistic sequences and has achieved
remarkable success. Among TSG, conditional models generate sequences given
observed covariates, however, such models learn observational correlations
without considering unobserved confounding. In this work, we propose a causal
perspective on conditional TSG and introduce causal time series generation as a
new TSG task family, formalized within Pearl's causal ladder, extending beyond
observational generation to include interventional and counterfactual settings.
To instantiate these tasks, we develop CaTSG, a unified diffusion-based
framework with backdoor-adjusted guidance that causally steers sampling toward
desired interventions and individual counterfactuals while preserving
observational fidelity. Specifically, our method derives causal score functions
via backdoor adjustment and the abduction-action-prediction procedure, thus
enabling principled support for all three levels of TSG. Extensive experiments
on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that CaTSG achieves superior
fidelity and also supporting interventional and counterfactual generation that
existing baselines cannot handle. Overall, we propose the causal TSG family and
instantiate it with CaTSG, providing an initial proof-of-concept and opening a
promising direction toward more reliable simulation under interventions and
counterfactual generation.

*Kjersti Engan,Neel Kanwal,Anita Yeconia,Ladislaus Blacy,Yuda Munyaw,Estomih Mduma,Hege Ersdal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes using a masked transformer-based autoencoder to reconstruct missing fetal heart rate (FHR) data, addressing signal dropouts often found in wearable monitoring devices, with potential applications in AI-based risk prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FHR monitoring is crucial for assessing fetal well-being and predicting the need for medical interventions, but signal dropouts during wearable monitoring hinder the reliability of AI analysis. Addressing this gap could provide better prediction capabilities through improved data quality.

Method: The authors introduce a masked transformer-based autoencoder to reconstruct FHR data by capturing spatial and frequency components, ensuring robustness across variable durations of missing data.

Result: The proposed method successfully reconstructs missing FHR signals, preserving spectral characteristics and showing robustness against different levels of data loss.

Conclusion: This approach enhances the usability of FHR datasets for AI applications and could be integrated into wearable devices for better fetal risk detection in real-time.

Abstract: Approximately 10\% of newborns require assistance to initiate breathing at
birth, and around 5\% need ventilation support. Fetal heart rate (FHR)
monitoring plays a crucial role in assessing fetal well-being during prenatal
care, enabling the detection of abnormal patterns and supporting timely
obstetric interventions to mitigate fetal risks during labor. Applying
artificial intelligence (AI) methods to analyze large datasets of continuous
FHR monitoring episodes with diverse outcomes may offer novel insights into
predicting the risk of needing breathing assistance or interventions. Recent
advances in wearable FHR monitors have enabled continuous fetal monitoring
without compromising maternal mobility. However, sensor displacement during
maternal movement, as well as changes in fetal or maternal position, often lead
to signal dropouts, resulting in gaps in the recorded FHR data. Such missing
data limits the extraction of meaningful insights and complicates automated
(AI-based) analysis. Traditional approaches to handle missing data, such as
simple interpolation techniques, often fail to preserve the spectral
characteristics of the signals. In this paper, we propose a masked
transformer-based autoencoder approach to reconstruct missing FHR signals by
capturing both spatial and frequency components of the data. The proposed
method demonstrates robustness across varying durations of missing data and can
be used for signal inpainting and forecasting. The proposed approach can be
applied retrospectively to research datasets to support the development of
AI-based risk algorithms. In the future, the proposed method could be
integrated into wearable FHR monitoring devices to achieve earlier and more
robust risk detection.

*Christoph Düsing,Philipp Cimiano*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Federated Markov Imputation (FMI), a method to handle missing data in federated learning for electronic health records, showing improved outcomes in sepsis prediction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges posed by missing healthcare data in federated learning setups, particularly in scenarios with inconsistent time-series granularity across institutions.

Method: Proposed a privacy-preserving Federated Markov Imputation (FMI) technique using global transition models for imputing missing temporal data in electronic health records.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance of FMI over local imputation methods in real-world settings, especially with irregular data sampling across institutions.

Conclusion: FMI effectively addresses the problem of inconsistent data sampling in federated learning, providing practical value in healthcare applications like sepsis prediction.

Abstract: Missing data is a persistent challenge in federated learning on electronic
health records, particularly when institutions collect time-series data at
varying temporal granularities. To address this, we propose Federated Markov
Imputation (FMI), a privacy-preserving method that enables Intensive Care Units
(ICUs) to collaboratively build global transition models for temporal
imputation. We evaluate FMI on a real-world sepsis onset prediction task using
the MIMIC-IV dataset and show that it outperforms local imputation baselines,
especially in scenarios with irregular sampling intervals across ICUs.

*Junyu Guo,Shangding Gu,Ming Jin,Costas Spanos,Javad Lavaei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces StyleBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate reasoning styles in LLMs across tasks and models, revealing no universally best style but offering insights on matching strategies to constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to understand the relationship between reasoning styles, model architecture, and task types to improve the effectiveness of LLM prompts.

Method: The study involves five reasoning styles tested on various tasks using 15 diverse open-source models, accompanied by a large-scale analysis of their performance.

Result: The results indicate that reasoning style effectiveness depends on model size and task type, with larger models performing better on complex reasoning strategies and smaller, efficient styles excelling in simpler tasks.

Conclusion: No reasoning style is universally optimal; practitioners should select strategies based on model characteristics and task requirements. The benchmark is publicly available for further research.

Abstract: The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) is heavily influenced by
the reasoning strategies, or styles of thought, employed in their prompts.
However, the interplay between these reasoning styles, model architecture, and
task type remains poorly understood. To address this, we introduce StyleBench,
a comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating reasoning styles across
diverse tasks and models. We assess five representative reasoning styles,
including Chain of Thought (CoT), Tree of Thought (ToT), Algorithm of Thought
(AoT), Sketch of Thought (SoT), and Chain-of-Draft (CoD) on five reasoning
tasks, using 15 open-source models from major families (LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral,
Gemma, GPT-OSS, Phi, and DeepSeek) ranging from 270M to 120B parameters. Our
large-scale analysis reveals that no single style is universally optimal. We
demonstrate that strategy efficacy is highly contingent on both model scale and
task type: search-based methods (AoT, ToT) excel in open-ended problems but
require large-scale models, while concise styles (SoT, CoD) achieve radical
efficiency gains on well-defined tasks. Furthermore, we identify key behavioral
patterns: smaller models frequently fail to follow output instructions and
default to guessing, while reasoning robustness emerges as a function of scale.
Our findings offer a crucial roadmap for selecting optimal reasoning strategies
based on specific constraints, we open source the benchmark in
https://github.com/JamesJunyuGuo/Style_Bench.

### [262] [Model-Based Reinforcement Learning under Random Observation Delays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20869)
*Armin Karamzade,Kyungmin Kim,JB Lanier,Davide Corsi,Roy Fox*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses random sensor delays in partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs), which disrupt standard RL methods, by proposing a delay-aware framework with a model-based filtering process to robustly handle out-of-sequence observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In real-world scenarios, sensor observations often experience random delays, but standard RL algorithms assume immediate observation processing and fail to address this challenge effectively.

Method: The authors propose a model-based filtering process that sequentially updates the belief state using incoming observations and integrate this into a delay-aware RL framework, specifically applying it to Dreamer.

Result: The proposed approach outperformed existing delay-aware baselines for MDPs, showed robustness to changes in delay distributions during deployment, and was superior to heuristic methods in simulated robotic tasks.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling observation delays in RL frameworks can significantly enhance performance and robustness in environments with random sensor delays, as shown by the proposed delay-aware approach.

Abstract: Delays frequently occur in real-world environments, yet standard
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms often assume instantaneous perception of
the environment. We study random sensor delays in POMDPs, where observations
may arrive out-of-sequence, a setting that has not been previously addressed in
RL. We analyze the structure of such delays and demonstrate that naive
approaches, such as stacking past observations, are insufficient for reliable
performance. To address this, we propose a model-based filtering process that
sequentially updates the belief state based on an incoming stream of
observations. We then introduce a simple delay-aware framework that
incorporates this idea into model-based RL, enabling agents to effectively
handle random delays. Applying this framework to Dreamer, we compare our
approach to delay-aware baselines developed for MDPs. Our method consistently
outperforms these baselines and demonstrates robustness to delay distribution
shifts during deployment. Additionally, we present experiments on simulated
robotic tasks, comparing our method to common practical heuristics and
emphasizing the importance of explicitly modeling observation delays.

### [263] [Distribution-Controlled Client Selection to Improve Federated Learning Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20877)
*Christoph Düsing,Philipp Cimiano*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses data imbalance in Federated Learning (FL) by introducing a client selection approach that improves model performance under varying imbalances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data imbalance among clients in FL reduces the effectiveness of the shared model and impacts its performance.

Method: The authors propose a client selection strategy that aligns label distributions with either a balanced distribution or the federation's combined label distribution.

Result: Empirical results indicate that aligning with a balanced distribution improves local imbalance, while aligning with the federation's label distribution excels under global imbalance.

Conclusion: Effective client selection can mitigate data imbalance issues in FL, enhancing model performance in privacy-sensitive domains.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm that allows
multiple clients to jointly train a shared model while maintaining data
privacy. Despite its great potential for domains with strict data privacy
requirements, the presence of data imbalance among clients is a thread to the
success of FL, as it causes the performance of the shared model to decrease. To
address this, various studies have proposed enhancements to existing FL
strategies, particularly through client selection methods that mitigate the
detrimental effects of data imbalance. In this paper, we propose an extension
to existing FL strategies, which selects active clients that best align the
current label distribution with one of two target distributions, namely a
balanced distribution or the federations combined label distribution.
Subsequently, we empirically verify the improvements through our
distribution-controlled client selection on three common FL strategies and two
datasets. Our results show that while aligning the label distribution with a
balanced distribution yields the greatest improvements facing local imbalance,
alignment with the federation's combined label distribution is superior for
global imbalance.

### [264] [Improving Early Sepsis Onset Prediction Through Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20885)
*Christoph Düsing,Philipp Cimiano*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Federated Learning-based Long Short-Term Memory model enhanced with attention mechanisms for sepsis onset prediction in ICUs, overcoming data privacy and prediction-window limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Timely prediction and intervention in sepsis is vital for improving patient outcomes, yet training machine learning models in this domain is hampered by limited data sharing and diversity across healthcare institutions.

Method: The authors employ Federated Learning to train a Long Short-Term Memory model enhanced with attention mechanisms using multi-centric ICU data, allowing variable prediction horizons for forecasting sepsis onset.

Result: Federated Learning-based training improves prediction performance, especially for early sepsis identification, achieving results comparable to centralized models while preserving patient privacy.

Conclusion: The approach reduces computational and organizational inefficiencies while enhancing early sepsis detection, demonstrating the benefits of using variable prediction horizons in a Federated Learning setup.

Abstract: Early and accurate prediction of sepsis onset remains a major challenge in
intensive care, where timely detection and subsequent intervention can
significantly improve patient outcomes. While machine learning models have
shown promise in this domain, their success is often limited by the amount and
diversity of training data available to individual hospitals and Intensive Care
Units (ICUs). Federated Learning (FL) addresses this issue by enabling
collaborative model training across institutions without requiring data
sharing, thus preserving patient privacy. In this work, we propose a federated,
attention-enhanced Long Short-Term Memory model for sepsis onset prediction,
trained on multi-centric ICU data. Unlike existing approaches that rely on
fixed prediction windows, our model supports variable prediction horizons,
enabling both short- and long-term forecasting in a single unified model.
During analysis, we put particular emphasis on the improvements through our
approach in terms of early sepsis detection, i.e., predictions with large
prediction windows by conducting an in-depth temporal analysis. Our results
prove that using FL does not merely improve overall prediction performance
(with performance approaching that of a centralized model), but is particularly
beneficial for early sepsis onset prediction. Finally, we show that our choice
of employing a variable prediction window rather than a fixed window does not
hurt performance significantly but reduces computational, communicational, and
organizational overhead.

*Hideyuki Suzuki,Hiroshi Yamashita*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deterministic denoising algorithm for discrete-state diffusion models, improving efficiency and sample quality in generative tasks such as text and image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Develop a more efficient, deterministic alternative to the stochastic denoising process for discrete-state diffusion models, potentially enhancing generative modeling.

Method: A variant of the herding algorithm with weakly chaotic dynamics is introduced, enabling deterministic, discrete state transitions without retraining or continuous state embeddings.

Result: Consistent improvements in both generative efficiency and sample quality were demonstrated in text and image generation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed deterministic approach can effectively replace stochastic processes in discrete-state diffusion, showcasing potential for broader applications in generative modeling.

Abstract: We propose a deterministic denoising algorithm for discrete-state diffusion
models based on Markov chains. The generative reverse process is derandomized
by introducing a variant of the herding algorithm with weakly chaotic dynamics,
which induces deterministic discrete state transitions. Our approach is a
direct replacement for the stochastic denoising process, requiring neither
retraining nor continuous state embeddings. We demonstrate consistent
improvements in both efficiency and sample quality on text and image generation
tasks. Thus, this simple derandomization approach is expected to enhance the
significance of discrete diffusion in generative modeling. Furthermore, our
results reveal that deterministic reverse processes, well established in
continuous diffusion, can also be effective in discrete state spaces.

*Ariadna Albors Zumel,Michele Tizzoni,Gian Maria Campedelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study examines how incorporating mobility features with historical crime and sociodemographic data enhances the accuracy of crime forecasting using a deep learning model across four U.S. cities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether micro-level mobility features, combined with historical crime and sociodemographic data, can improve predictions in crime forecasting, specifically at fine-grained spatial and temporal resolutions.

Method: The researchers used data from police departments, sociodemographic surveys, and human mobility trackers across Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Philadelphia (2019-2023). They applied a ConvLSTM network using input sequences of 14-day and 2-day intervals to predict crime occurrences 12 hours ahead, comparing results with logistic regression, random forest, and standard LSTM models.

Result: Incorporating mobility features enhances predictive performance, especially with shorter input sequences. Using both mobility and sociodemographic data results in the best performance across all cities, with the ConvLSTM model achieving the highest recall, precision, and F1 scores. Longer input sequences improve predictions for violent crimes, while shorter sequences work better for property crimes.

Conclusion: Integrating diverse data sources, such as mobility and sociodemographic features, boosts spatiotemporal crime forecasting accuracy. Deep learning shows clear benefits but also limitations in handling fine-grained spatial and temporal resolutions.

Abstract: Objectives: To develop a deep learning framework to evaluate if and how
incorporating micro-level mobility features, alongside historical crime and
sociodemographic data, enhances predictive performance in crime forecasting at
fine-grained spatial and temporal resolutions.
  Methods: We advance the literature on computational methods and crime
forecasting by focusing on four U.S. cities (i.e., Baltimore, Chicago, Los
Angeles, and Philadelphia). We employ crime incident data obtained from each
city's police department, combined with sociodemographic data from the American
Community Survey and human mobility data from Advan, collected from 2019 to
2023. This data is aggregated into grids with equally sized cells of 0.077 sq.
miles (0.2 sq. kms) and used to train our deep learning forecasting model, a
Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) network, which predicts crime
occurrences 12 hours ahead using 14-day and 2-day input sequences. We also
compare its performance against three baseline models: logistic regression,
random forest, and standard LSTM.
  Results: Incorporating mobility features improves predictive performance,
especially when using shorter input sequences. Noteworthy, however, the best
results are obtained when both mobility and sociodemographic features are used
together, with our deep learning model achieving the highest recall, precision,
and F1 score in all four cities, outperforming alternative methods. With this
configuration, longer input sequences enhance predictions for violent crimes,
while shorter sequences are more effective for property crimes.
  Conclusion: These findings underscore the importance of integrating diverse
data sources for spatiotemporal crime forecasting, mobility included. They also
highlight the advantages (and limits) of deep learning when dealing with
fine-grained spatial and temporal scales.

TL;DR: The paper investigate improving energy efficiency in hydraulic circuits of excavation equipment, comparing a conventional directional control valve (PDCV) with an innovative flow control valve (PFCV).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heavy earth moving equipment's linear actuators, particularly those in excavation booms, consume significant energy. The authors aim to develop energy-efficient solutions to reduce heat loss and environmental impact.

Method: Two hydraulic circuits are analyzed: a conventional proportional directional control valve (PDCV) and a novel proportional flow control valve (PFCV) with artificial leakage. Position control is implemented using PID controllers fine-tuned by fuzzy logic, and simulations are performed in MATLAB/Simulink.

Result: The system with the PFCV shows 8.5% higher energy efficiency compared to the conventional PDCV-based hydraulic circuit.

Conclusion: The proposed PFCV-based hydraulic system demonstrates reduced energy losses, lower operating costs, and decreased environmental impact, offering promising advancements for heavy equipment actuator technology.

Abstract: The article focuses on enhancing the energy efficiency of linear actuators
used in heavy earth moving equipment, particularly in the booms ofexcavation
equipment. Two hydraulic circuits are compared in terms of energy efficiency,
with one using a conventional proportional directionalcontrol valve (PDCV) and
the other using an innovative solution of proportional flow control valve
(PFCV) with artificial leakage between thetwo ends of the actuator. The PFCV
reduces energy loss in the form of heat by bypassing the extra flow from the
pump during position control,unlike the PDCV that uses a pressure relief valve.
The hydraulic circuit using PFCV is found to be 8.5% more energy efficient than
theconventional circuit using PDCV. The article also discusses the position
control of the actuator, which is achieved using a PID controller tuned by a
fuzzy controller. Thesimulation of the hydraulic circuit is carried out using
MATLAB/Simulink, and the results are compared with experiments. Overall, the
proposedapproach could lead to significant improvements in the energy
efficiency of linear actuators used in heavy earth moving equipment,
therebyreducing their environmental impact and operating costs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GenFacts, a generative framework for creating plausible and interpretable counterfactual explanations for multivariate time series.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing counterfactual methods for multivariate time series often produce invalid or unintuitive results, highlighting the need for improved approaches.

Method: The authors propose GenFacts, a framework leveraging a class-discriminative variational autoencoder with additional objectives and constraints to ensure plausibility and interpretability.

Result: GenFacts significantly improves counterfactual plausibility by 18.7% and achieves the highest interpretability scores in a human study across two datasets.

Conclusion: Plausibility and human-centered interpretability are crucial for actionable counterfactual explanations in multivariate time series, and GenFacts sets a new benchmark in this regard.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations aim to enhance model transparency by showing how
inputs can be minimally altered to change predictions. For multivariate time
series, existing methods often generate counterfactuals that are invalid,
implausible, or unintuitive. We introduce GenFacts, a generative framework
based on a class-discriminative variational autoencoder. It integrates
contrastive and classification-consistency objectives, prototype-based
initialization, and realism-constrained optimization. We evaluate GenFacts on
radar gesture data as an industrial use case and handwritten letter
trajectories as an intuitive benchmark. Across both datasets, GenFacts
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in plausibility (+18.7%) and achieves
the highest interpretability scores in a human study. These results highlight
that plausibility and user-centered interpretability, rather than sparsity
alone, are key to actionable counterfactuals in time series data.

*Zida Liang,Jiayi Zhu,Weiqiang Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates why transformer-based models often underperform or degrade to MLPs in time series forecasting, finding that poor embeddings disrupt the attention mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite their success in NLP and CV, transformers fail to outperform simple baselines in time series forecasting, motivating a closer look into the root causes of their underperformance.

Method: The authors conducted systematic experiments by progressively modifying transformers into MLPs to study the role of the attention mechanism and designed interpretable datasets to identify underlying issues.

Result: The analysis revealed that transformers often degenerate into MLPs in time series applications, mainly due to embedding methods that fail to create a structured latent space, impairing the attention mechanism.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the failure of the embedding methods is a primary reason for the ineffectiveness of transformers in time series forecasting, shedding light on potential areas for improvement.

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures achieved high performance in natural language
processing and computer vision, yet many studies have shown that they have not
demonstrated a clear advantage in time series forecasting and even underperform
simple linear baselines in some cases. However, most of these studies have not
thoroughly explored the reasons behind the failure of transformers. To better
understand time-series transformers(TST), we designed a series of experiments,
progressively modifying transformers into MLPs to investigate the impact of the
attention mechanism. Surprisingly, transformer blocks often degenerate into
simple MLPs in existing time-series transformers. We designed a interpretable
dataset to investigate the reasons behind the failure of the attention
mechanism and revealed that the attention mechanism is not working in the
expected way. We theoretically analyzed the reasons behind this phenomenon,
demonstrating that the current embedding methods fail to allow transformers to
function in a well-structured latent space, and further analyzed the deeper
underlying causes of the failure of embedding.

### [270] [Decoupled-Value Attention for Prior-Data Fitted Networks: GP Inference for Physical Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20950)
*Kaustubh Sharma,Simardeep Singh,Parikshit Pareek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Decoupled-Value Attention (DVA) for improving Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs), which act as fast surrogates for Gaussian Process (GP) inference. DVA reduces validation loss in high-dimensional regression tasks, and PFNs become around 80 times faster than exact GP inference with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for efficient and faster alternatives to Gaussian Process (GP) inference, especially for high-dimensional regression tasks where traditional methods are computationally expensive.

Method: The paper proposes Decoupled-Value Attention (DVA), which mimics Gaussian-process updates. DVA decouples input similarity computation and label propagation, enabling kernel-free and efficient operations. They evaluate PFNs using localized attention and various architectures.

Result: PFNs with DVA demonstrate over 50% lower validation loss in high-dimensional tasks, with CNN-based PFNs performing at par with Transformer-based ones. They achieve high accuracy in 64-dimensional tasks with a mean absolute error of ~1E-3 and are over 80x faster than exact GP inference.

Conclusion: Attention mechanisms (specifically DVA) are the key to scaling PFNs, outperforming architectural considerations. PFNs with DVA significantly reduce computational effort and achieve high accuracy, proving their utility in high-dimensional regression scenarios.

Abstract: Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) are a promising alternative to
time-consuming Gaussian Process (GP) inference for creating fast surrogates of
physical systems. PFN reduces the computational burden of GP-training by
replacing Bayesian inference in GP with a single forward pass of a learned
prediction model. However, with standard Transformer attention, PFNs show
limited effectiveness on high-dimensional regression tasks. We introduce
Decoupled-Value Attention (DVA)-- motivated by the GP property that the
function space is fully characterized by the kernel over inputs and the
predictive mean is a weighted sum of training targets. DVA computes
similarities from inputs only and propagates labels solely through values.
Thus, the proposed DVA mirrors the Gaussian-process update while remaining
kernel-free. We demonstrate that the crucial factor for scaling PFNs is the
attention rule rather than the architecture itself. Specifically, our results
demonstrate that (a) localized attention consistently reduces out-of-sample
validation loss in PFNs across different dimensional settings, with validation
loss reduced by more than 50% in five- and ten-dimensional cases, and (b) the
role of attention is more decisive than the choice of backbone architecture,
showing that CNN-based PFNs can perform at par with their Transformer-based
counterparts. The proposed PFNs provide 64-dimensional power flow equation
approximations with a mean absolute error of the order of 1E-3, while being
over 80x faster than exact GP inference.

*Weili Zeng,Yichao Yan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The authors identify and address a stability issue in flow matching for generative modeling and representation learning, introducing a hybrid method called Local Contrastive Flow (LCF) to mitigate problems in low-noise scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow matching has gained traction in generative modeling and representation learning but suffers from instability in low-noise regimes, which degrades training and representation quality. This paper seeks to diagnose and solve this issue.

Method: The authors analyze the instability, termed the 'low-noise pathology,' and propose Local Contrastive Flow (LCF), which combines direct velocity regression at moderate-high noise levels and contrastive feature alignment at low noise levels.

Result: LCF improves the convergence speed and stabilizes the quality of representations, addressing the limitations caused by low-noise pathologies.

Conclusion: Addressing low-noise-related pathologies is essential for unlocking the full potential of flow matching in generative modeling and representation learning, and LCF is a promising solution.

Abstract: Flow matching has recently emerged as a powerful alternative to diffusion
models, providing a continuous-time formulation for generative modeling and
representation learning. Yet, we show that this framework suffers from a
fundamental instability in the low-noise regime. As noise levels approach zero,
arbitrarily small perturbations in the input can induce large variations in the
velocity target, causing the condition number of the learning problem to
diverge. This ill-conditioning not only slows optimization but also forces the
encoder to reallocate its limited Jacobian capacity toward noise directions,
thereby degrading semantic representations. We provide the first theoretical
analysis of this phenomenon, which we term the low-noise pathology,
establishing its intrinsic link to the structure of the flow matching
objective. Building on these insights, we propose Local Contrastive Flow (LCF),
a hybrid training protocol that replaces direct velocity regression with
contrastive feature alignment at small noise levels, while retaining standard
flow matching at moderate and high noise. Empirically, LCF not only improves
convergence speed but also stabilizes representation quality. Our findings
highlight the critical importance of addressing low-noise pathologies to unlock
the full potential of flow matching for both generation and representation
learning.

*Zhengyuan Shi,Jingxin Wang,Wentao Jiang,Chengyu Ma,Ziyang Zheng,Zhufei Chu,Weikang Qian,Qiang Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores how to enhance multiview learning on Boolean circuits by addressing the challenges posed by structural heterogeneity between views, using a functional alignment approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multiview learning on Boolean circuits has great potential due to the complementary structural and semantic information in different graph representations. However, the heterogeneity across views presents a major challenge, particularly for self-supervised techniques like masked modeling.

Method: The paper introduces MixGate, a framework that uses an Equivalence Alignment Loss to create a shared, function-aware representation space as a precondition before applying a multiview masked modeling objective.

Result: Through extensive experiments and a key ablation study, the authors demonstrate that first aligning views using their strategy significantly improves the effectiveness of multiview masked modeling, transforming it into a powerful technique.

Conclusion: The alignment-first approach taken by MixGate unlocks the potential of self-supervised multiview learning by addressing view heterogeneity, leading to improved performance.

Abstract: Multiview learning on Boolean circuits holds immense promise, as different
graph-based representations offer complementary structural and semantic
information. However, the vast structural heterogeneity between views, such as
an And-Inverter Graph (AIG) versus an XOR-Majority Graph (XMG), poses a
critical barrier to effective fusion, especially for self-supervised techniques
like masked modeling. Naively applying such methods fails, as the cross-view
context is perceived as noise. Our key insight is that functional alignment is
a necessary precondition to unlock the power of multiview self-supervision. We
introduce MixGate, a framework built on a principled training curriculum that
first teaches the model a shared, function-aware representation space via an
Equivalence Alignment Loss. Only then do we introduce a multiview masked
modeling objective, which can now leverage the aligned views as a rich,
complementary signal. Extensive experiments, including a crucial ablation
study, demonstrate that our alignment-first strategy transforms masked modeling
from an ineffective technique into a powerful performance driver.

TL;DR: LEON uses large language models (LLMs) and optimization techniques to propose personalized medical treatments, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of surrogate models, which often fail to generalize in predicting the efficacy of patient-specific treatments.

Method: The research introduces LEON, leveraging large language models (LLMs) as black-box optimizers using the 'optimization by prompting' strategy to contextualize unstructured medical knowledge.

Result: LEON demonstrated superior performance over traditional and LLM-based methods in experiments for designing personalized treatments.

Conclusion: LEON provides a novel and effective approach for utilizing domain-specific knowledge and LLMs to optimize personalized medical treatments, showing promise for real-world applications.

Abstract: The goal of personalized medicine is to discover a treatment regimen that
optimizes a patient's clinical outcome based on their personal genetic and
environmental factors. However, candidate treatments cannot be arbitrarily
administered to the patient to assess their efficacy; we often instead have
access to an in silico surrogate model that approximates the true fitness of a
proposed treatment. Unfortunately, such surrogate models have been shown to
fail to generalize to previously unseen patient-treatment combinations. We
hypothesize that domain-specific prior knowledge - such as medical textbooks
and biomedical knowledge graphs - can provide a meaningful alternative signal
of the fitness of proposed treatments. To this end, we introduce LLM-based
Entropy-guided Optimization with kNowledgeable priors (LEON), a mathematically
principled approach to leverage large language models (LLMs) as black-box
optimizers without any task-specific fine-tuning, taking advantage of their
ability to contextualize unstructured domain knowledge to propose personalized
treatment plans in natural language. In practice, we implement LEON via
'optimization by prompting,' which uses LLMs as stochastic engines for
proposing treatment designs. Experiments on real-world optimization tasks show
LEON outperforms both traditional and LLM-based methods in proposing
individualized treatments for patients.

### [274] [CLUE: Conflict-guided Localization for LLM Unlearning Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20977)
*Hang Chen,Jiaying Zhu,Xinyu Yang,Wenya Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework (CLUE) to unlearn undesirable knowledge in LLMs by distinguishing neurons for forgetting from those to retain, achieving superior results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of existing methods that fail to disentangle neurons responsible for forgetting and retaining, which risks over-forgetting or incomplete erasure.

Method: The method combines circuit discovery and conjunctive normal form techniques to localize and categorize neurons, followed by targeted fine-tuning for precise unlearning.

Result: CLUE demonstrates better efficacy in forgetting undesirable knowledge while maintaining essential skills compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: By accurately identifying and categorizing neurons into forget and retain groups, CLUE ensures both effective forgetting and knowledge retention in LLM unlearning tasks.

Abstract: The LLM unlearning aims to eliminate the influence of undesirable data
without affecting causally unrelated information. This process typically
involves using a forget set to remove target information, alongside a retain
set to maintain non-target capabilities. While recent localization-based
methods demonstrate promise in identifying important neurons to be unlearned,
they fail to disentangle neurons responsible for forgetting undesirable
knowledge or retaining essential skills, often treating them as a single
entangled group. As a result, these methods apply uniform interventions,
risking catastrophic over-forgetting or incomplete erasure of the target
knowledge. To address this, we turn to circuit discovery, a mechanistic
interpretability technique, and propose the Conflict-guided Localization for
LLM Unlearning framEwork (CLUE). This framework identifies the forget and
retain circuit composed of important neurons, and then the circuits are
transformed into conjunctive normal forms (CNF). The assignment of each neuron
in the CNF satisfiability solution reveals whether it should be forgotten or
retained. We then provide targeted fine-tuning strategies for different
categories of neurons. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to
existing localization methods, CLUE achieves superior forget efficacy and
retain utility through precise neural localization.

*Xiangyu Dong,Xingyi Zhang,Sibo Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FracAug, a framework for graph-level anomaly detection. It enhances Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) through semantic graph augmentation and pseudo-labeling, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of high labeling costs and dataset imbalance in graph-level anomaly detection while improving the efficacy of GNNs.

Method: A framework called FracAug is proposed which employs semantic graph augmentation using a weighted distance-aware margin loss. The method synthesizes graph variants to retain semantic consistency and uses iterative pseudo-labeling to expand training data.

Result: Experiments with 14 GNNs on 12 datasets showed up to 5.72% improvement in AUROC, 7.23% in AUPRC, and 4.18% in F1-score, highlighting its efficacy.

Conclusion: FracAug is a universal, model-agnostic approach that effectively improves GNN performance in graph-level anomaly detection tasks, addressing labeling cost and data imbalance challenges.

Abstract: Graph-level anomaly detection (GAD) is critical in diverse domains such as
drug discovery, yet high labeling costs and dataset imbalance hamper the
performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). To address these issues, we
propose FracAug, an innovative plug-in augmentation framework that enhances
GNNs by generating semantically consistent graph variants and pseudo-labeling
with mutual verification. Unlike previous heuristic methods, FracAug learns
semantics within given graphs and synthesizes fractional variants, guided by a
novel weighted distance-aware margin loss. This captures multi-scale topology
to generate diverse, semantic-preserving graphs unaffected by data imbalance.
Then, FracAug utilizes predictions from both original and augmented graphs to
pseudo-label unlabeled data, iteratively expanding the training set. As a
model-agnostic module compatible with various GNNs, FracAug demonstrates
remarkable universality and efficacy: experiments across 14 GNNs on 12
real-world datasets show consistent gains, boosting average AUROC, AUPRC, and
F1-score by up to 5.72%, 7.23%, and 4.18%, respectively.

*Liwen Sun,Hao-Ren Yao,Gary Gao,Ophir Frieder,Chenyan Xiong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CATCH-FM, a cancer pre-screening methodology using electronic healthcare records (EHR) and large healthcare-focused foundation models to identify high-risk patients with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current cancer screening techniques are expensive, intrusive, and not globally accessible, leading to preventable deaths from delayed detection.

Method: Researchers developed and pretrained EHR foundation models up to 2.4 billion parameters on medical code sequences and fine-tuned them on curated cancer risk prediction datasets. These models were retrospectively evaluated on a dataset of 30,000 patients.

Result: CATCH-FM demonstrated high efficacy in cancer risk prediction, achieving 60% sensitivity and 99% specificity, outperforming other models and achieving state-of-the-art results on pancreatic cancer risk prediction benchmarks.

Conclusion: CATCH-FM is robust, operates effectively across diverse patient demographics and healthcare systems, and provides a promising alternative for early cancer risk screening based solely on EHR data. The code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Cancer screening, leading to early detection, saves lives. Unfortunately,
existing screening techniques require expensive and intrusive medical
procedures, not globally available, resulting in too many lost would-be-saved
lives. We present CATCH-FM, CATch Cancer early with Healthcare Foundation
Models, a cancer pre-screening methodology that identifies high-risk patients
for further screening solely based on their historical medical records. With
millions of electronic healthcare records (EHR), we establish the scaling law
of EHR foundation models pretrained on medical code sequences, pretrain
compute-optimal foundation models of up to 2.4 billion parameters, and finetune
them on clinician-curated cancer risk prediction cohorts. In our retrospective
evaluation comprising of thirty thousand patients, CATCH-FM achieved strong
efficacy (60% sensitivity) with low risk (99% specificity and Negative
Predictive Value), outperforming feature-based tree models as well as general
and medical large language models by large margins. Despite significant
demographic, healthcare system, and EHR coding differences, CATCH-FM achieves
state-of-the-art pancreatic cancer risk prediction on the EHRSHOT few-shot
leaderboard, outperforming EHR foundation models pretrained using on-site
patient data. Our analysis demonstrates the robustness of CATCH-FM in various
patient distributions, the benefits of operating in the ICD code space, and its
ability to capture non-trivial cancer risk factors. Our code will be
open-sourced.

### [277] [Toward Robust and Efficient ML-Based GPU Caching for Modern Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20979)
*Peng Chen,Jiaji Zhang,Hailiang Zhao,Yirong Zhang,Jiahong Yu,Xueyan Tang,Yixuan Wang,Hao Li,Jianping Zou,Gang Xiong,Kingsum Chow,Shuibing He,Shuiguang Deng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a GPU caching framework, LCR, which enhances cache efficiency using a learning-augmented LRU algorithm adaptable to prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GPU inference struggles with cache inefficiency, such as embedding hit rates and TTFT issues, and existing heuristic or learning-based methods have significant limitations.

Method: The framework, LCR, combines machine-learned predictions with the LRU algorithm to create LARU, which dynamically adapts to prediction quality via online error estimation.

Result: LCR achieves up to 24.2% throughput improvement and reduces P99 TTFT by up to 28.3% in realistic DLRM and LLM scenarios, even showing robust performance under poor predictions.

Conclusion: LCR effectively bridges the gap between theoretical advancements and practical applications in learning-based GPU caching, offering a robust and efficient solution to caching bottlenecks.

Abstract: In modern GPU inference, cache efficiency remains a major bottleneck. In
recommendation models, embedding hit rates largely determine throughput, while
in large language models, KV-cache misses substantially increase
time-to-first-token (TTFT). Heuristic policies such as \textsc{LRU} often
struggle under structured access patterns. Learning-based approaches are
promising, but in practice face two major limitations: they degrade sharply
when predictions are inaccurate, or they gain little even with accurate
predictions due to conservative designs. Some also incur high overhead, further
limiting practicality.
  We present \textsc{LCR}, a practical framework for learning-based GPU caching
that delivers performance gains while ensuring robustness and efficiency. Its
core algorithm, \textsc{LARU}, enhances \textsc{LRU} with machine-learned
predictions and dynamically adapts to prediction accuracy through online error
estimation. When predictions are accurate, \textsc{LARU} achieves near-optimal
performance. With inaccurate predictions, it degrades gracefully to
near-\textsc{LRU} performance. With \textsc{LCR}, we bridge the gap between
empirical progress and theoretical advances in learning-based caching.
  Experiments show that \textsc{LCR} delivers consistent gains under realistic
conditions. In DLRM and LLM scenarios, it improves throughput by up to 24.2\%
and reduces P99 TTFT by up to 28.3\%, outperforming widely used inference
systems. Even under poor predictions, its performance remains stable,
demonstrating practical robustness.

### [278] [Binary Autoencoder for Mechanistic Interpretability of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20997)
*Hakaze Cho,Haolin Yang,Brian M. Kurkoski,Naoya Inoue*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Binary Autoencoder (BAE) to enhance feature sparsity and independence in large language models, overcoming limitations of prior methods relying on implicit sparsity constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for interpreting hidden states of LLMs produce dense feature sets due to insufficient global sparsity constraints, which hinders feature atomization and interpretability.

Method: The authors propose BAE, an autoencoder that enforces minimal entropy on minibatches of hidden activations by discretizing them to 1-bit for efficient entropy calculation. Gradient estimation is used for backpropagation.

Result: BAE improves feature untangling and sparsity, avoids issues with dense features, and produces more interpretable features compared to baseline methods. It also allows for reliable entropy estimation on binary activations.

Conclusion: BAE is an effective tool for extracting atomized features from LLMs and understanding inference dynamics, outperforming existing feature interpretation methods in both feature sparsity and interpretability.

Abstract: Existing works are dedicated to untangling atomized numerical components
(features) from the hidden states of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
interpreting their mechanism. However, they typically rely on autoencoders
constrained by some implicit training-time regularization on single training
instances (i.e., $L_1$ normalization, top-k function, etc.), without an
explicit guarantee of global sparsity among instances, causing a large amount
of dense (simultaneously inactive) features, harming the feature sparsity and
atomization. In this paper, we propose a novel autoencoder variant that
enforces minimal entropy on minibatches of hidden activations, thereby
promoting feature independence and sparsity across instances. For efficient
entropy calculation, we discretize the hidden activations to 1-bit via a step
function and apply gradient estimation to enable backpropagation, so that we
term it as Binary Autoencoder (BAE) and empirically demonstrate two major
applications: (1) Feature set entropy calculation. Entropy can be reliably
estimated on binary hidden activations, which we empirically evaluate and
leverage to characterize the inference dynamics of LLMs and In-context
Learning. (2) Feature untangling. Similar to typical methods, BAE can extract
atomized features from LLM's hidden states. To robustly evaluate such feature
extraction capability, we refine traditional feature-interpretation methods to
avoid unreliable handling of numerical tokens, and show that BAE avoids dense
features while producing the largest number of interpretable ones among
baselines, which confirms the effectiveness of BAE serving as a feature
extractor.

*Qingyu Han,Qian Li,Linxin Yang,Qian Chen,Qingjiang Shi,Ruoyu Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses Integer Linear Program (ILP) optimization challenges using a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based approach, introducing a Local-UID scheme to improve expressiveness and reduce spurious correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the Learning to Optimize (L2O) paradigm for ILP problems, overcoming the limitations of standard GNNs and reducing the generalization issues caused by Global-UID schemes.

Method: The authors propose a Local-UID scheme using d-hop uniqueness coloring, enabling unique identifiers in local neighborhoods. They design ColorGNN and ColorUID models, integrating this scheme to ensure improved expressiveness and generalization.

Result: The proposed methods show significant improvements on ILP benchmarks, achieving strong out-of-distribution generalization on linear programming datasets and improving graph-level tasks when used with state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The Local-UID scheme combined with ColorGNN/ColorUID demonstrates effectiveness in addressing ILP challenges, offering a balance of expressiveness and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) are central to real-world optimizations but
notoriously difficult to solve. Learning to Optimize (L2O) has emerged as a
promising paradigm, with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) serving as the standard
backbone. However, standard anonymous GNNs are limited in expressiveness for
ILPs, and the common enhancement of augmenting nodes with globally unique
identifiers (UIDs) typically introduces spurious correlations that severely
harm generalization. To address this tradeoff, we propose a parsimonious
Local-UID scheme based on d-hop uniqueness coloring, which ensures identifiers
are unique only within each node's d-hop neighborhood. Building on this scheme,
we introduce ColorGNN, which incorporates color information via
color-conditioned embeddings, and ColorUID, a lightweight feature-level
variant. We prove that for d-layer networks, Local-UIDs achieve the expressive
power of Global-UIDs while offering stronger generalization. Extensive
experiments show that our approach (i) yields substantial gains on three ILP
benchmarks, (ii) exhibits strong OOD generalization on linear programming
datasets, and (iii) further improves a general graph-level task when paired
with a state-of-the-art method.

### [280] [Lossless Compression: A New Benchmark for Time Series Model Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21002)
*Meng Wan,Benxi Tian,Jue Wang,Cui Hui,Ningming Nie,Tiantian Liu,Zongguo Wang,Cao Rongqiang,Peng Shi,Yangang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Researchers propose lossless compression as a novel evaluation criterion for time series models, grounded in information theory, and introduce the TSCom-Bench framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of time series models, like forecasting or anomaly detection, don't rigorously assess whether a model captures the generative data distribution.

Method: Utilize lossless compression, based on Shannon's source coding theorem, as a metric tied to negative log-likelihood. Develop the TSCom-Bench framework for standardized evaluation.

Result: Experiments show lossless compression exposes distributional flaws in state-of-the-art time series models overlooked by traditional benchmarks.

Conclusion: Lossless compression serves as a rigorous, complementary benchmark for evaluating time series models, enhancing model assessment through an information-theoretic lens.

Abstract: The evaluation of time series models has traditionally focused on four
canonical tasks: forecasting, imputation, anomaly detection, and
classification. While these tasks have driven significant progress, they
primarily assess task-specific performance and do not rigorously measure
whether a model captures the full generative distribution of the data. We
introduce lossless compression as a new paradigm for evaluating time series
models, grounded in Shannon's source coding theorem. This perspective
establishes a direct equivalence between optimal compression length and the
negative log-likelihood, providing a strict and unified information-theoretic
criterion for modeling capacity. Then We define a standardized evaluation
protocol and metrics. We further propose and open-source a comprehensive
evaluation framework TSCom-Bench, which enables the rapid adaptation of time
series models as backbones for lossless compression. Experiments across diverse
datasets on state-of-the-art models, including TimeXer, iTransformer, and
PatchTST, demonstrate that compression reveals distributional weaknesses
overlooked by classic benchmarks. These findings position lossless compression
as a principled task that complements and extends existing evaluation for time
series modeling.

*Seokbin Yoon,Keumjin Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces MAIFormer, a neural architecture designed to predict multi-agent flight trajectories using attention modules for improved accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flight trajectory prediction for multiple aircraft is challenging due to the need to model individual behavior and complex interactions, while also ensuring transparency in predictions.

Method: The MAIFormer model incorporates two attention modules: masked multivariate attention for individual aircraft dynamics, and agent attention for interactions amongst multiple aircraft.

Result: MAIFormer demonstrates superior performance on real-world flight trajectory data from Incheon International Airport, outperforming other methods and providing interpretable predictions.

Conclusion: The proposed framework improves prediction accuracy and interpretability, enhancing its practical applicability in air traffic control systems.

Abstract: Flight trajectory prediction for multiple aircraft is essential and provides
critical insights into how aircraft navigate within current air traffic flows.
However, predicting multi-agent flight trajectories is inherently challenging.
One of the major difficulties is modeling both the individual aircraft
behaviors over time and the complex interactions between flights. Generating
explainable prediction outcomes is also a challenge. Therefore, we propose a
Multi-Agent Inverted Transformer, MAIFormer, as a novel neural architecture
that predicts multi-agent flight trajectories. The proposed framework features
two key attention modules: (i) masked multivariate attention, which captures
spatio-temporal patterns of individual aircraft, and (ii) agent attention,
which models the social patterns among multiple agents in complex air traffic
scenes. We evaluated MAIFormer using a real-world automatic dependent
surveillance-broadcast flight trajectory dataset from the terminal airspace of
Incheon International Airport in South Korea. The experimental results show
that MAIFormer achieves the best performance across multiple metrics and
outperforms other methods. In addition, MAIFormer produces prediction outcomes
that are interpretable from a human perspective, which improves both the
transparency of the model and its practical utility in air traffic control.

*Haotian Guo,Hui Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ExMoIRL introduces a framework for drug design by integrating phenotype-guided and target-specific approaches using reinforcement learning to generate potent molecules with favorable properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current drug design methods struggle with high costs and limited system-level insights, prompting a need for combined phenotype-guided and target-specific solutions.

Method: A generative framework called ExMoIRL uses a pretrained phenotype-guided generator fine-tuned with multi-objective reinforcement learning, balancing factors like docking affinity, drug-likeness, and molecule diversity.

Result: ExMoIRL outperforms state-of-the-art models, generating molecules with superior drug-like properties, high target affinity, and significant inhibitory potency against cancer cells.

Conclusion: Integrating phenotype-guided and target-specific strategies in drug design demonstrates potential for more efficient and effective molecule discovery.

Abstract: The generation of high-quality candidate molecules remains a central
challenge in AI-driven drug design. Current phenotype-based and target-based
strategies each suffer limitations, either incurring high experimental costs or
overlook system-level cellular responses. To bridge this gap, we propose
ExMoIRL, a novel generative framework that synergistically integrates
phenotypic and target-specific cues for de novo molecular generation. The
phenotype-guided generator is first pretrained on expansive drug-induced
transcriptional profiles and subsequently fine-tuned via multi-objective
reinforcement learning (RL). Crucially, the reward function fuses docking
affinity and drug-likeness scores, augmented with ranking loss,
prior-likelihood regularization, and entropy maximization. The multi-objective
RL steers the model toward chemotypes that are simultaneously potent, diverse,
and aligned with the specified phenotypic effects. Extensive experiments
demonstrate ExMoIRL's superior performance over state-of-the-art
phenotype-based and target-based models across multiple well-characterized
targets. Our generated molecules exhibit favorable drug-like properties, high
target affinity, and inhibitory potency (IC50) against cancer cells. This
unified framework showcases the synergistic potential of combining
phenotype-guided and target-aware strategies, offering a more effective
solution for de novo drug discovery.

### [283] [Mechanism of Task-oriented Information Removal in In-context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21012)
*Hakaze Cho,Haolin Yang,Gouki Minegishi,Naoya Inoue*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the mechanism of in-context learning (ICL) in language models (LMs) by exploring a novel perspective on information removal. The findings suggest that selective information removal is key to improving task-specific outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the unclear mechanism of in-context learning (ICL), an emerging few-shot learning paradigm in language models.

Method: Analyzed the hidden state representations of language models, focusing on the role of information removal through low-rank filters for steering models towards specific tasks. Identified and tested 'Denoising Heads' in LMs through ablation experiments.

Result: Found that task-specific information removal is critical for ICL's success, with 'Denoising Heads' playing a vital role in the process. ICL accuracy deteriorates when information removal is blocked, particularly when few-shot demonstrations lack the correct label.

Conclusion: Selective information removal is a crucial mechanism underlying in-context learning, with specific attention heads (Denoising Heads) playing a significant role in this process.

Abstract: In-context Learning (ICL) is an emerging few-shot learning paradigm based on
modern Language Models (LMs), yet its inner mechanism remains unclear. In this
paper, we investigate the mechanism through a novel perspective of information
removal. Specifically, we demonstrate that in the zero-shot scenario, LMs
encode queries into non-selective representations in hidden states containing
information for all possible tasks, leading to arbitrary outputs without
focusing on the intended task, resulting in near-zero accuracy. Meanwhile, we
find that selectively removing specific information from hidden states by a
low-rank filter effectively steers LMs toward the intended task. Building on
these findings, by measuring the hidden states on carefully designed metrics,
we observe that few-shot ICL effectively simulates such task-oriented
information removal processes, selectively removing the redundant information
from entangled non-selective representations, and improving the output based on
the demonstrations, which constitutes a key mechanism underlying ICL. Moreover,
we identify essential attention heads inducing the removal operation, termed
Denoising Heads, which enables the ablation experiments blocking the
information removal operation from the inference, where the ICL accuracy
significantly degrades, especially when the correct label is absent from the
few-shot demonstrations, confirming both the critical role of the information
removal mechanism and denoising heads.

### [284] [Predicting LLM Reasoning Performance with Small Proxy Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21013)
*Woosung Koh,Juyoung Suk,Sungjun Han,Se-Young Yun,Jay Shin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces "rBridge," a method enabling smaller proxy models (≤1B parameters) to predict reasoning capabilities of larger models effectively, optimizing dataset preparation at significantly lower costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training large language models is expensive, especially for reasoning tasks that require large model sizes (>7B parameters). The motivation is to find a more cost-effective way to optimize datasets using smaller proxy models.

Method: rBridge aligns smaller proxy models with the pre-training objective and target reasoning tasks by weighting negative log-likelihood with task alignment. Reasoning traces from advanced models are used as gold labels.

Result: The proposed method reduces dataset ranking costs by more than 100x compared to baselines, shows strong correlations across six reasoning benchmarks from 1B to 32B scale, and demonstrates zero-shot transferability across pre-training datasets (1B to 7B scale).

Conclusion: rBridge provides a cost-effective solution for advancing reasoning-oriented pre-training using smaller, less expensive proxy models.

Abstract: Given the prohibitive cost of pre-training large language models, it is
essential to leverage smaller proxy models to optimize datasets before scaling
up. However, this approach becomes challenging for reasoning capabilities,
which exhibit emergent behavior that only appear reliably at larger model
sizes, often exceeding 7B parameters. To address this, we introduce rBridge,
showing that small proxies ($\leq$1B) can effectively predict large-model
reasoning by aligning more closely with (1) the pre-training objective and (2)
the target task. rBridge achieves this by weighting negative log-likelihood
with task alignment, using reasoning traces from frontier models as gold
labels. In our experiments, rBridge (i) reduces dataset ranking costs by over
100x relative to the best baseline, (ii) achieves the strongest correlation
across six reasoning benchmarks at 1B to 32B scale, and (iii) zero-shot
transfers predictive relationships across pre-training datasets at 1B to 7B
scale. These findings indicate that rBridge offers a practical path for
exploring reasoning-oriented pre-training at lower cost.

*Yiyou Sun,Yuhan Cao,Pohao Huang,Haoyue Bai,Hannaneh Hajishirzi,Nouha Dziri,Dawn Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DELTA-Code, a benchmark designed to study whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can acquire new reasoning strategies through reinforcement learning and transfer these strategies beyond their pre-trained capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address whether LLMs can genuinely learn and generalize novel reasoning strategies outside of their existing skillsets derived from pre-training or post-training.

Method: The authors created DELTA-Code, an evaluation framework using synthetic coding problem families to test learnability (through reinforcement learning) and transferability, with experiments incorporating techniques like staged warm-ups, curriculum training, and experience replay.

Result: The findings show that RL-trained models can achieve near-perfect accuracy after initial failures ('grokking phase'), demonstrate strong intra-family learning and recomposed skill transfer, but still struggle with transformative out-of-distribution generalizations.

Conclusion: DELTA-Code reveals the strengths and limitations of RL-driven learning in LLMs, serving as a benchmark to explore their ability to move beyond prior knowledge and acquire new algorithmic skills.

Abstract: It remains an open question whether LLMs can acquire or generalize genuinely
new reasoning strategies, beyond the sharpened skills encoded in their
parameters during pre-training or post-training. To attempt to answer this
debate, we introduce DELTA-Code--Distributional Evaluation of Learnability and
Transferrability in Algorithmic Coding, a controlled benchmark of synthetic
coding problem families designed to probe two fundamental aspects: learnability
-- can LLMs, through reinforcement learning (RL), solve problem families where
pretrained models exhibit failure with large enough attempts (pass@K=0)? --and
transferrability -- if learnability happens, can such skills transfer
systematically to out-of-distribution (OOD) test sets? Unlike prior public
coding datasets, DELTA isolates reasoning skills through templated problem
generators and introduces fully OOD problem families that demand novel
strategies rather than tool invocation or memorized patterns. Our experiments
reveal a striking grokking phase transition: after an extended period with
near-zero reward, RL-trained models abruptly climb to near-perfect accuracy. To
enable learnability on previously unsolvable problem families, we explore key
training ingredients such as staged warm-up with dense rewards, experience
replay, curriculum training, and verification-in-the-loop. Beyond learnability,
we use DELTA to evaluate transferability or generalization along exploratory,
compositional, and transformative axes, as well as cross-family transfer.
Results show solid gains within families and for recomposed skills, but
persistent weaknesses in transformative cases. DELTA thus offers a clean
testbed for probing the limits of RL-driven reasoning and for understanding how
models can move beyond existing priors to acquire new algorithmic skills.

*Donghyeon Ki,Hee-Jun Ahn,Kyungyoon Kim,Byung-Jun Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ACA (Actor-Critic without Actor), a novel reinforcement learning framework that eliminates the explicit actor network, simplifying the training process while maintaining competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the complexity and training vulnerabilities of traditional actor-critic RL methods, as well as the computational challenges associated with diffusion model-based policies.

Method: ACA removes the explicit actor network and generates actions directly from the gradient field of a noise-level critic, simplifying the training process and aligning policy improvement with the critic's value estimates.

Result: ACA achieves favorable learning curves and competitive performance on standard online RL benchmarks compared to both traditional actor-critic methods and state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods.

Conclusion: ACA provides a simple yet powerful alternative to traditional RL methods, reducing algorithmic and computational overheads while maintaining expressive and efficient policy learning.

Abstract: Actor-critic methods constitute a central paradigm in reinforcement learning
(RL), coupling policy evaluation with policy improvement. While effective
across many domains, these methods rely on separate actor and critic networks,
which makes training vulnerable to architectural decisions and hyperparameter
tuning. Such complexity limits their scalability in settings that require large
function approximators. Recently, diffusion models have recently been proposed
as expressive policies that capture multi-modal behaviors and improve
exploration, but they introduce additional design choices and computational
burdens, hindering efficient deployment. We introduce Actor-Critic without
Actor (ACA), a lightweight framework that eliminates the explicit actor network
and instead generates actions directly from the gradient field of a noise-level
critic. This design removes the algorithmic and computational overhead of actor
training while keeping policy improvement tightly aligned with the critic's
latest value estimates. Moreover, ACA retains the ability to capture diverse,
multi-modal behaviors without relying on diffusion-based actors, combining
simplicity with expressiveness. Through extensive experiments on standard
online RL benchmarks,ACA achieves more favorable learning curves and
competitive performance compared to both standard actor-critic and
state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods, providing a simple yet powerful
solution for online RL.

*Runqi Lin,Alasdair Paren,Suqin Yuan,Muyang Li,Philip Torr,Adel Bibi,Tongliang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discusses vulnerabilities in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) caused by visual jailbreaking attacks and introduces a method to make these attacks transferable across different models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual jailbreaking attacks on MLLMs, although impactful, lack cross-model transferability, limiting their ability to detect vulnerabilities in closed-source systems.

Method: The authors analyzed the loss landscape and feature representations of existing attacks. They then developed a method called Feature Over-Reliance CorrEction (FORCE) to broaden attack feasibility by addressing over-reliance on narrow layer features and semantically poor frequency components.

Result: FORCE discovered flattened feasible regions for visual jailbreaking attacks, increasing their cross-model transferability. Experiments show its effectiveness in aiding evaluations of closed-source MLLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed FORCE method improves the reliability and transferability of visual attacks against MLLMs, offering a more robust framework for red-teaming evaluations.

Abstract: The integration of new modalities enhances the capabilities of multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) but also introduces additional vulnerabilities.
In particular, simple visual jailbreaking attacks can manipulate open-source
MLLMs more readily than sophisticated textual attacks. However, these
underdeveloped attacks exhibit extremely limited cross-model transferability,
failing to reliably identify vulnerabilities in closed-source MLLMs. In this
work, we analyse the loss landscape of these jailbreaking attacks and find that
the generated attacks tend to reside in high-sharpness regions, whose
effectiveness is highly sensitive to even minor parameter changes during
transfer. To further explain the high-sharpness localisations, we analyse their
feature representations in both the intermediate layers and the spectral
domain, revealing an improper reliance on narrow layer representations and
semantically poor frequency components. Building on this, we propose a Feature
Over-Reliance CorrEction (FORCE) method, which guides the attack to explore
broader feasible regions across layer features and rescales the influence of
frequency features according to their semantic content. By eliminating
non-generalizable reliance on both layer and spectral features, our method
discovers flattened feasible regions for visual jailbreaking attacks, thereby
improving cross-model transferability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our approach effectively facilitates visual red-teaming evaluations against
closed-source MLLMs.

### [288] [Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning Enhances Activation Intensity and Diversity in the Internal Circuitry of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21044)
*Honglin Zhang,Qianyue Hao,Fengli Xu,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes changes in large language models (LLMs) induced by reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning, revealing increased activation intensity and diversity in pathways.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanisms behind why RL-based fine-tuning enhances the capabilities of LLMs compared to traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT).

Method: Edge attribution patching (EAP) was used to analyze internal differences in LLMs before and after RL fine-tuning across multiple model families.

Result: RL fine-tuning leads to higher activation intensity and more diverse activation patterns, suggesting improved redundancy and flexibility in information flow.

Conclusion: RL fine-tuning fundamentally reshapes LLMs' internal circuitry, enhancing generalization capabilities, while Direct Preference Optimization shows weaker or inconsistent changes.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) acquire extensive prior knowledge through
large-scale pretraining and can be further enhanced via supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training. A growing body of
evidence has shown that RL fine-tuning improves the capability of LLMs beyond
what SFT alone achieves. However, the underlying mechanisms why RL fine-tuning
is able to enhance the capability of various LLMs with distinct intrinsic
characteristics remain underexplored. In this study, we draw inspiration from
prior work on edge attribution patching (EAP) to investigate the internal
differences of LLMs before and after RL fine-tuning. Our analysis across
multiple model families shows two robust effects of online RL post-training:
(i) an overall increase in activation intensity, indicating that more internal
pathways are engaged and their signals become stronger, and (ii) greater
diversity in activation patterns, reflected by higher entropy and less
concentrated edge distributions. These changes suggest that RL reshapes
information flow to be both more redundant and more flexible, which may explain
its advantage in generalization. Notably, models fine-tuned with Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) deviate from these trends, exhibiting
substantially weaker or inconsistent internal changes compared to PPO- and
GRPO-based training. Together, our findings provide a unified view of how RL
fine-tuning systematically alters the internal circuitry of LLMs and highlight
the methodological distinctions between online RL and preference-based
approaches. Our code is open source at

*Bing Liu,Wenqiang Yv,Xuzheng Yang,Shichang Wang,Junzhuo Liu,Peng Wang,Guoqing Wang,Yang Yang,Heng Tao Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces GeoRef, a benchmark dataset and task for Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) in geometric problems, aiming to improve AI's ability to interpret geometric elements based on textual prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To fill the gap in AI's ability to analyze diagrams and understand geometric elements via natural language queries, which is foundational for robust geometric problem-solving.

Method: Developed the GeoRef dataset with annotations and queries, created a synthetic dataset for training using geometric formal language, and experimented with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Additionally, introduced a verify-and-regenerate mechanism.

Result: GRPO significantly surpasses SFT in performance, while a verify-and-regenerate method further improves accuracy. However, state-of-the-art models still struggle with this task, showing a need for better geometric grounding.

Conclusion: The study highlights REC as a critical capability for improving geometric problem-solving, with GeoRef enabling measurable downstream improvements in multimodal mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: AI-driven geometric problem solving is a complex vision-language task that
requires accurate diagram interpretation, mathematical reasoning, and robust
cross-modal grounding. A foundational yet underexplored capability for this
task is the ability to identify and interpret geometric elements based on
natural language queries. To address this, we introduce the task of Referring
Expression Comprehension (REC) for geometric problems, which evaluates whether
models can localize points, shapes, and spatial relations in diagrams in
response to textual prompts. We present GeoRef, a benchmark dataset constructed
from existing geometric problem corpora, featuring diverse, high-quality
annotations and queries. Due to the lack of annotated data for this task, we
generate a large-scale synthetic training dataset using a structured geometric
formal language, enabling broad coverage of geometric concepts and facilitating
model adaptation. We explore two fine-tuning approaches: Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our results show that GRPO
significantly outperforms SFT by better aligning model behavior with
task-specific rewards. Furthermore, we propose a verify-and-regenerate
mechanism that detects incorrect predictions and re-infers answers using
contextual reasoning history, further boosting accuracy. Notably, even
state-of-the-art Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with this
task, underscoring the necessity of explicitly evaluating and strengthening
geometric grounding as a prerequisite for robust geometric problem solving.
Moreover, models trained on GeoRef demonstrate measurable improvements on
downstream geometric reasoning tasks, highlighting the broader value of REC as
a foundation for multimodal mathematical understanding.

*Sedjro Salomon Hotegni,Sebastian Peitz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPREAD, a generative framework using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) for efficient multi-objective optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-objective optimization methods face challenges in efficiently computing Pareto optimal sets, especially for large and expensive problems.

Method: SPREAD employs a conditional diffusion process to learn from decision space points, refines candidates with gradient descent-inspired updates, and enhances diversity using a Gaussian RBF-based repulsion term.

Result: SPREAD demonstrates improved efficiency, scalability, and Pareto front coverage compared to leading baselines in various optimization benchmarks.

Conclusion: SPREAD efficiently addresses multi-objective optimization challenges and outperforms other methods in diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Developing efficient multi-objective optimization methods to compute the
Pareto set of optimal compromises between conflicting objectives remains a key
challenge, especially for large-scale and expensive problems. To bridge this
gap, we introduce SPREAD, a generative framework based on Denoising Diffusion
Probabilistic Models (DDPMs). SPREAD first learns a conditional diffusion
process over points sampled from the decision space and then, at each reverse
diffusion step, refines candidates via a sampling scheme that uses an adaptive
multiple gradient descent-inspired update for fast convergence alongside a
Gaussian RBF-based repulsion term for diversity. Empirical results on
multi-objective optimization benchmarks, including offline and Bayesian
surrogate-based settings, show that SPREAD matches or exceeds leading baselines
in efficiency, scalability, and Pareto front coverage.

*Zhen Liu,Yongtao Zhang,Shaobo Ren,Yuxin You*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SATMC, a framework that aligns graph structure and attributes for graph domain adaptation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current graph domain adaptation methods face challenges with structural heterogeneity, leading to poor distribution alignment across graph domains.

Method: The proposed SATMC uses sequential alignment of graph structures and attributes, incorporates a private domain information reduction mechanism, and applies an empirical Wasserstein distance.

Result: SATMC demonstrates superior performance in cross-network node classification, backed by experiments on nine cross-domain datasets.

Conclusion: SATMC effectively addresses structural heterogeneity in graph domain adaptation, achieving a tighter error bound and better performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Graph domain adaptation has gained significant attention in label-scarce
scenarios across different graph domains. Traditional approaches to graph
domain adaptation primarily focus on transforming node attributes over raw
graph structures and aligning the distributions of the transformed node
features across networks. However, these methods often struggle with the
underlying structural heterogeneity between distinct graph domains, which leads
to suboptimal distribution alignment. To address this limitation, we propose
Structure-Attribute Transformation with Markov Chain (SATMC), a novel framework
that sequentially aligns distributions across networks via both graph structure
and attribute transformations. To mitigate the negative influence of
domain-private information and further enhance the model's generalization,
SATMC introduces a private domain information reduction mechanism and an
empirical Wasserstein distance. Theoretical proofs suggest that SATMC can
achieve a tighter error bound for cross-network node classification compared to
existing graph domain adaptation methods. Extensive experiments on nine pairs
of publicly available cross-domain datasets show that SATMC outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in the cross-network node classification task. The

### [292] [ScaleDiff: Scaling Difficult Problems for Advanced Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21070)
*Qizhi Pei,Zhuoshi Pan,Honglin Lin,Xin Gao,Yu Li,Zinan Tang,Conghui He,Rui Yan,Lijun Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ScaleDiff pipeline improves mathematical problem-solving performance by efficiently generating and utilizing difficult problems, outperforming other recent models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in scaling automated synthesis of mathematical problems, including high computational costs and limitations in difficulty level generation.

Method: The ScaleDiff pipeline filters difficult problems using an adaptive thinking model, then trains a problem generator (DiffGen-8B) to produce problems at scale for fine-tuning reasoning models.

Result: Fine-tuning on the ScaleDiff-Math dataset led to a substantial improvement of 11.3% in performance and achieved competitive accuracy on benchmarks using cost-efficient models.

Conclusion: ScaleDiff effectively scales the creation of challenging mathematical problems, enhancing reasoning model capabilities while minimizing computational costs.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown impressive capabilities in complex
problem-solving, often benefiting from training on difficult mathematical
problems that stimulate intricate reasoning. Recent efforts have explored
automated synthesis of mathematical problems by prompting proprietary models or
large-scale open-source models from seed data or inherent mathematical
concepts. However, scaling up these methods remains challenging due to their
high computational/API cost, complexity of prompting, and limited difficulty
level of the generated problems. To overcome these limitations, we propose
ScaleDiff, a simple yet effective pipeline designed to scale the creation of
difficult problems. We efficiently identify difficult problems from existing
datasets with only a single forward pass using an adaptive thinking model,
which can perceive problem difficulty and automatically switch between
"Thinking" and "NoThinking" modes. We then train a specialized difficult
problem generator (DiffGen-8B) on this filtered difficult data, which can
produce new difficult problems in large scale, eliminating the need for
complex, per-instance prompting and its associated high API costs. Fine-tuning
Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct on the ScaleDiff-Math dataset yields a substantial
performance increase of 11.3% compared to the original dataset and achieves a
65.9% average accuracy on AIME'24, AIME'25, HMMT-Feb'25, BRUMO'25, and MATH500,
outperforming recent strong LRMs like OpenThinker3. Notably, this performance
is achieved using the cost-efficient Qwen3-8B model as a teacher, demonstrating
that our pipeline can effectively transfer advanced reasoning capabilities
without relying on larger, more expensive teacher models. Furthermore, we
observe a clear scaling phenomenon in model performance on difficult benchmarks
as the quantity of difficult problems increases. Code:

*Ahmet Caner Yüzügüler,Ahmet Çelik,Jiawei Zhuang,Lukas Cavigelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TyphoonMLA is a hybrid attention mechanism combining naive and absorb methods for improved throughput in MLA architectures, with up to 3.24x speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in current decoding kernels for Multi-Head Latent Attention mechanisms, which are either compute-bound or HBM bandwidth-limited.

Method: TyphoonMLA employs a hybrid approach, leveraging the naive formulation for compute-bound parts and absorb formulation for bandwidth-efficient parts.

Result: TyphoonMLA achieves up to 3x and 3.24x throughput improvement on NPU and GPUs, respectively, with minimal overhead.

Conclusion: By combining the strengths of both naive and absorb methods, TyphoonMLA significantly enhances attention calculation performance in MLA architectures.

Abstract: Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) is a recent attention mechanism adopted in
state-of-the-art LLMs such as DeepSeek-v3 and Kimi K2. Thanks to its novel
formulation, MLA allows two functionally equivalent but computationally
distinct kernel implementations: naive and absorb. While the naive kernels
(e.g., FlashAttention) are typically preferred in training and prefill for
their computational efficiency, existing decoding kernels (e.g., FlashMLA) rely
on the absorb method to minimize HBM bandwidth usage. However, the
compute-bound nature of the absorb implementations prohibits performance
benefits from data reuse opportunities in attention calculations, such as
shared prefixes. In this work, we introduce TyphoonMLA, a hybrid approach that
combines naive and absorb formulations to harness the strengths of both.
TyphoonMLA effectively leverages the shared prefix by applying the naive
formulation to the compute-bound parts of attention calculations, while
reducing the bandwidth requirements for non-shared parts by using the absorb
formulation. As a result, TyphoonMLA improves the throughput of attention
calculations in MLA architectures by up to 3x and 3.24x on NPU and GPUs, with
only a 3% overhead in HBM size.

*Louis Van Langendonck,Guillermo Bernárdez,Nina Miolane,Pere Barlet-Ros*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The authors introduce GraphUniverse, a novel framework for generating families of graphs to study inductive generalization and robustness in graph learning across unseen graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph learning benchmarks largely focus on single-graph, transductive scenarios, limiting the ability to study generalization to new, unseen graph structures.

Method: GraphUniverse generates graph families with persistent semantic communities and controlled structural properties to facilitate performance benchmarking under conditions like distribution shifts. It evaluates diverse architectures, including GNNs and graph transformers.

Result: The experiments show that transductive performance is a poor predictor of inductive generalization. Further, robustness to distribution shifts depends on the architecture and initial graph properties like homophily.

Conclusion: GraphUniverse provides a scalable and flexible platform for evaluating and developing robust, generalizable graph learning models, advancing the field beyond existing transductive limitations.

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in graph learning is understanding how models
generalize to new, unseen graphs. While synthetic benchmarks offer controlled
settings for analysis, existing approaches are confined to single-graph,
transductive settings where models train and test on the same graph structure.
Addressing this gap, we introduce GraphUniverse, a framework for generating
entire families of graphs to enable the first systematic evaluation of
inductive generalization at scale. Our core innovation is the generation of
graphs with persistent semantic communities, ensuring conceptual consistency
while allowing fine-grained control over structural properties like homophily
and degree distributions. This enables crucial but underexplored robustness
tests, such as performance under controlled distribution shifts. Benchmarking a
wide range of architectures -- from GNNs to graph transformers and topological
architectures -- reveals that strong transductive performance is a poor
predictor of inductive generalization. Furthermore, we find that robustness to
distribution shift is highly sensitive not only to model architecture choice
but also to the initial graph regime (e.g., high vs. low homophily). Beyond
benchmarking, GraphUniverse's flexibility and scalability can facilitate the
development of robust and truly generalizable architectures -- including
next-generation graph foundation models. An interactive demo is available at

### [295] [Teaching RL Agents to Act Better: VLM as Action Advisor for Online Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21126)
*Xiefeng Wu,Jing Zhao,Shu Zhang,Mingyu Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces VARL, a framework using vision-language models (VLMs) as action advisors to improve online reinforcement learning, enhancing sample efficiency without compromising optimality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online RL requires numerous interactions for learning, which is computationally expensive. VLMs offer potential for diverse tasks, but their low-level control performance is limited, demanding task-specific fine-tuning.

Method: VARL uses VLMs to provide action suggestions to reinforcement learning agents, rather than altering rewards or requiring demonstrations. This promotes sample diversity and supports learning in sparse-reward tasks.

Result: VARL significantly boosts sample efficiency while maintaining minimal computational overhead across various environments and agent settings.

Conclusion: VARL offers an efficient and general framework for online reinforcement learning, enabling direct application in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Online reinforcement learning in complex tasks is time-consuming, as massive
interaction steps are needed to learn the optimal Q-function.Vision-language
action (VLA) policies represent a promising direction for solving diverse
tasks; however, their performance on low-level control remains limited, and
effective deployment often requires task-specific expert demonstrations for
fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose \textbf{VARL} (\textbf{V}LM as
\textbf{A}ction advisor for online \textbf{R}einforcement \textbf{L}earning), a
framework that leverages the domain knowledge of vision-language models (VLMs)
to provide action suggestions for reinforcement learning agents. Unlike
previous methods, VARL provides action suggestions rather than designing
heuristic rewards, thereby guaranteeing unchanged optimality and convergence.
The suggested actions increase sample diversity and ultimately improve sample
efficiency, especially in sparse-reward tasks. To validate the effectiveness of
VARL, we evaluate it across diverse environments and agent settings. Results
show that VARL greatly improves sample efficiency without introducing
significant computational overhead. These advantages make VARL a general
framework for online reinforcement learning and make it feasible to directly
apply reinforcement learning from scratch in real-world environments.

### [296] [EvoMail: Self-Evolving Cognitive Agents for Adaptive Spam and Phishing Email Defense](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21129)
*Wei Huang,De-Tian Chu,Lin-Yuan Bai,Wei Kang,Hai-Tao Zhang,Bo Li,Zhi-Mo Han,Jing Ge,Hai-Feng Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EvoMail is a framework that uses advanced technologies like Cognitive Graph Neural Networks and Large Language Models to detect advanced email spam and phishing attacks, outperforming existing systems in accuracy and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rapid evolution of spam and phishing tactics has rendered traditional static and single-modal detection systems ineffective, necessitating a robust multi-modal and adaptive solution.

Method: EvoMail builds a unified heterogeneous email graph combining text, metadata, and embedded resources. It leverages a Cognitive Graph Neural Network, aided by a Large Language Model, and incorporates a self-evolution loop with red-team/blue-team cycles for continuous adaptation.

Result: Experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets show that EvoMail achieves superior detection accuracy, adapts effectively to evolving spam tactics, and provides interpretable reasoning compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: EvoMail demonstrates its potential as a resilient and robust defense framework, offering explainable and adaptive solutions to counter advanced spam and phishing threats.

Abstract: Modern email spam and phishing attacks have evolved far beyond keyword
blacklists or simple heuristics. Adversaries now craft multi-modal campaigns
that combine natural-language text with obfuscated URLs, forged headers, and
malicious attachments, adapting their strategies within days to bypass filters.
Traditional spam detection systems, which rely on static rules or
single-modality models, struggle to integrate heterogeneous signals or to
continuously adapt, leading to rapid performance degradation.
  We propose EvoMail, a self-evolving cognitive agent framework for robust
detection of spam and phishing. EvoMail first constructs a unified
heterogeneous email graph that fuses textual content, metadata (headers,
senders, domains), and embedded resources (URLs, attachments). A Cognitive
Graph Neural Network enhanced by a Large Language Model (LLM) performs
context-aware reasoning across these sources to identify coordinated spam
campaigns. Most critically, EvoMail engages in an adversarial self-evolution
loop: a ''red-team'' agent generates novel evasion tactics -- such as character
obfuscation or AI-generated phishing text -- while the ''blue-team'' detector
learns from failures, compresses experiences into a memory module, and reuses
them for future reasoning.
  Extensive experiments on real-world datasets (Enron-Spam, Ling-Spam,
SpamAssassin, and TREC) and synthetic adversarial variants demonstrate that
EvoMail consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in detection
accuracy, adaptability to evolving spam tactics, and interpretability of
reasoning traces. These results highlight EvoMail's potential as a resilient
and explainable defense framework against next-generation spam and phishing
threats.

*Killian Steunou,Sigurd Saue,Théo Druilhe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper revisits linear dimensionality reduction to improve adversarial robustness in neural networks, using sparse PCA (SPCA) as a defense method against adversarial attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks are highly effective at image classification tasks but are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, necessitating simple and effective defensive mechanisms.

Method: The authors compare Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Sparse PCA (SPCA) as front-end feature extractors, derive theoretical robustness certificates for SPCA, and conduct experiments using both linear and non-linear classifiers.

Result: SPCA consistently outperforms PCA in robustness against adversarial attacks while achieving comparable accuracy on clean data.

Conclusion: Sparser projections offered by SPCA reduce adversarial leverage, improving robustness without significantly sacrificing accuracy, as confirmed by theoretical analysis and empirical results.

Abstract: Deep neural networks perform remarkably well on image classification tasks
but remain vulnerable to carefully crafted adversarial perturbations. This work
revisits linear dimensionality reduction as a simple, data-adapted defense. We
empirically compare standard Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with its sparse
variant (SPCA) as front-end feature extractors for downstream classifiers, and
we complement these experiments with a theoretical analysis. On the theory
side, we derive exact robustness certificates for linear heads applied to SPCA
features: for both $\ell_\infty$ and $\ell_2$ threat models (binary and
multiclass), the certified radius grows as the dual norms of $W^\top u$ shrink,
where $W$ is the projection and $u$ the head weights. We further show that for
general (non-linear) heads, sparsity reduces operator-norm bounds through a
Lipschitz composition argument, predicting lower input sensitivity.
Empirically, with a small non-linear network after the projection, SPCA
consistently degrades more gracefully than PCA under strong white-box and
black-box attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy. Taken together,
the theory identifies the mechanism (sparser projections reduce adversarial
leverage) and the experiments verify that this benefit persists beyond the
linear setting. Our code is available at

*Ivan Stresec,Joana P. Gonçalves*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method named LAVA to enhance the interpretability of latent spaces in unsupervised models by explaining local embedding structures via correlations with input features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsupervised models often produce complex latent embeddings that are challenging to interpret, limiting their utility in scientific discovery.

Method: The proposed method, LAVA, uses post-hoc analysis to represent latent space as local neighborhoods defined by feature correlations and identifies recurring patterns across the entire latent embedding.

Result: LAVA effectively reveals meaningful feature associations by applying it to UMAP embeddings of MNIST and single-cell kidney datasets, showcasing visually and biologically relevant local correlations.

Conclusion: LAVA provides a model-agnostic strategy to enhance explanations in unsupervised learning by uncovering patterns in latent spaces and linking them to input feature associations.

Abstract: Unsupervised black-box models can be drivers of scientific discovery, but
remain difficult to interpret. Crucially, discovery hinges on understanding the
model output, which is often a multi-dimensional latent embedding rather than a
well-defined target. While explainability for supervised learning usually seeks
to uncover how input features are used to predict a target, its unsupervised
counterpart should relate input features to the structure of the learned latent
space. Adaptations of supervised model explainability for unsupervised learning
provide either single-sample or dataset-wide summary explanations. However,
without automated strategies of relating similar samples to one another guided
by their latent proximity, explanations remain either too fine-grained or too
reductive to be meaningful. This is especially relevant for manifold learning
methods that produce no mapping function, leaving us only with the relative
spatial organization of their embeddings. We introduce Locality-Aware Variable
Associations (LAVA), a post-hoc model-agnostic method designed to explain local
embedding organization through its relationship with the input features. To
achieve this, LAVA represents the latent space as a series of localities
(neighborhoods) described in terms of correlations between the original
features, and then reveals reoccurring patterns of correlations across the
entire latent space. Based on UMAP embeddings of MNIST and a single-cell kidney
dataset, we show that LAVA captures relevant feature associations, with
visually and biologically relevant local patterns shared among seemingly
distant regions of the latent spaces.

*Ruiyu Wang,Shizhao Sun,Weijian Ma,Jiang Bian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CAD-Tokenizer, a framework improving text-guided CAD modeling by aligning tokenization with CAD’s geometry and structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing large language model tokenizers fail to capture the primitive-level semantics and geometric structure of CAD data, limiting the effectiveness of text-guided CAD design.

Method: The paper proposes CAD-Tokenizer, which employs a multimodal tokenization strategy and sequence-based VQ-VAE with primitive-level pooling and constrained decoding to create compact, primitive-aware representations of CAD data.

Result: CAD-Tokenizer demonstrates significant improvements in instruction-following and generation quality for text-guided CAD prototyping compared to general-purpose LLMs and baseline methods.

Conclusion: Aligning CAD tokenization with its primitive-based structural nature is key to enhancing text-to-CAD capabilities, leading to more effective unified CAD design processes.

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is a foundational component of industrial
prototyping, where models are defined not by raw coordinates but by
construction sequences such as sketches and extrusions. This sequential
structure enables both efficient prototype initialization and subsequent
editing. Text-guided CAD prototyping, which unifies Text-to-CAD generation and
CAD editing, has the potential to streamline the entire design pipeline.
However, prior work has not explored this setting, largely because standard
large language model (LLM) tokenizers decompose CAD sequences into
natural-language word pieces, failing to capture primitive-level CAD semantics
and hindering attention modules from modeling geometric structure. We
conjecture that a multimodal tokenization strategy, aligned with CAD's
primitive and structural nature, can provide more effective representations. To
this end, we propose CAD-Tokenizer, a framework that represents CAD data with
modality-specific tokens using a sequence-based VQ-VAE with primitive-level
pooling and constrained decoding. This design produces compact, primitive-aware
representations that align with CAD's structural nature. Applied to unified
text-guided CAD prototyping, CAD-Tokenizer significantly improves instruction
following and generation quality, achieving better quantitative and qualitative
performance over both general-purpose LLMs and task-specific baselines.

*Michael Sullivan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the built-in reward structure of the GRPO RL algorithm and proposes improvements for better model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the implicit process reward model induced by the GRPO algorithm and assess its advantages and flaws in real-world RL scenarios.

Method: Theoretical analysis to define the PRM induced by GRPO, empirical validation under real-world settings, and a proposed modification ($\lambda$-GRPO) to correct identified flaws.

Result: The modified $\lambda$-GRPO algorithm leads to higher validation accuracy, faster peak performance, and better results in downstream reasoning tasks compared to the standard GRPO.

Conclusion: Explicitly-defined PRMs may not be necessary for GRPO algorithms as leveraging the built-in PRM structure with minor modifications provides significant advantages.

Abstract: We prove theoretically that the GRPO RL algorithm induces a non-trivial
process reward model (PRM), under certain assumptions regarding within-group
overlap of token sequences across completions. We then show empirically that
these assumptions are met under real-world conditions: GRPO does in fact induce
a non-trivial PRM. Leveraging the framework of GRPO-as-a-PRM, we identify a
flaw in the GRPO objective: non-uniformly distributed process steps hinder both
exploration and exploitation (under different conditions). We propose a simple
modification to the algorithm to mitigate this defect ($\lambda$-GRPO), and
show that LLMs trained with $\lambda$-GRPO achieve higher validation accuracy
and performance on downstream reasoning tasks$-$and reach peak performance more
rapidly$-$than LLMs trained with standard GRPO. Our results call into question
the advantage of costly, explicitly-defined PRMs for GRPO: we show that it is
possible to instead leverage the hidden, built-in PRM structure within the
vanilla GRPO algorithm to boost model performance with a negligible impact on
training time and cost.

### [301] [DATS: Distance-Aware Temperature Scaling for Calibrated Class-Incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21161)
*Giuseppe Serra,Florian Buettner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes Distance-Aware Temperature Scaling (DATS) for continual learning to improve calibration across tasks by adapting temperatures based on task proximity, achieving better stability and reliability compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind the paper is to address the challenge of balancing predictive performance and calibrated confidence in continual learning, particularly to deal with issues like Catastrophic Forgetting and variable calibration accuracy across tasks.

Method: The method combines prototype-based distance estimation with a novel Distance-Aware Temperature Scaling (DATS) mechanism to dynamically adapt temperature scaling based on inferred task proximity, without requiring explicit task information during testing or deployment.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces calibration errors more consistently and reliably across tasks on both standard benchmarks and real-world datasets, especially biomedical datasets.

Conclusion: DATS offers a principled solution for achieving stable and reliable calibration in continual learning, proving to be a significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) is recently gaining increasing attention for its
ability to enable a single model to learn incrementally from a sequence of new
classes. In this scenario, it is important to keep consistent predictive
performance across all the classes and prevent the so-called Catastrophic
Forgetting (CF). However, in safety-critical applications, predictive
performance alone is insufficient. Predictive models should also be able to
reliably communicate their uncertainty in a calibrated manner - that is, with
confidence scores aligned to the true frequencies of target events. Existing
approaches in CL address calibration primarily from a data-centric perspective,
relying on a single temperature shared across all tasks. Such solutions
overlook task-specific differences, leading to large fluctuations in
calibration error across tasks. For this reason, we argue that a more
principled approach should adapt the temperature according to the distance to
the current task. However, the unavailability of the task information at test
time/during deployment poses a major challenge to achieve the intended
objective. For this, we propose Distance-Aware Temperature Scaling (DATS),
which combines prototype-based distance estimation with distance-aware
calibration to infer task proximity and assign adaptive temperatures without
prior task information. Through extensive empirical evaluation on both standard
benchmarks and real-world, imbalanced datasets taken from the biomedical
domain, our approach demonstrates to be stable, reliable and consistent in
reducing calibration error across tasks compared to state-of-the-art
approaches.

*Jacob Fein-Ashley,Dhruv Parikh,Rajgopal Kannan,Viktor Prasanna*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Mixture of Thoughts (MoT) method enables collaboration between specialized LLMs by combining latent-level interactions via routing and attention mechanisms, resulting in improved benchmarks without significant inference overheads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in leveraging various specialized open-source LLMs collaboratively, improving performance across diverse domains using efficient techniques.

Method: MoT introduces a global routing scheme where top-K experts are selected, and interaction layers enable latent space collaboration through cross-attention mechanisms among frozen pre-trained LLMs.

Result: MoT surpassed state-of-the-art methods like 'Avengers,' achieving improvements of +0.38% (ID benchmarks) and +2.92% (OOD benchmarks) while outperforming the best single model in various benchmarks efficiently.

Conclusion: MoT provides a practical, efficient method for multi-LLM collaboration leveraging latent interactions, enhancing domain-specific LLM performance without iterative aggregation complexities.

Abstract: Open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly specialize by domain
(e.g., math, code, general reasoning), motivating systems that leverage
complementary strengths across models. Prior multi-LLM approaches either (i)
route a query to one or a few experts and generate independently, (ii)
aggregate outputs from each model via costly multi-turn exchanges, or (iii)
fuse weights into a single model-typically requiring architectural homogeneity.
We introduce Mixture of Thoughts (MoT), a simple method for latent-level
collaboration among heterogeneous experts under a global routing scheme. For
each query, a lightweight router selects top-$K$ experts and designates a
primary expert; uniformly placed interaction layers project hidden states into
a shared latent space where the primary expert performs cross-attention over
its active (selected) peers. Pre-trained experts remain frozen; only the router
and the lightweight interaction layers are trained with a novel joint training
objective that improves both the expert selection and inter-expert
collaboration. Across five in-distribution (ID) and three out-of-distribution
(OOD) benchmarks, MoT surpasses the current routing and aggregation-based
state-of-the-art, Avengers, by $+0.38\%$ and $+2.92\%$, respectively. Further,
MoT significantly outperforms the best-performing single model. It achieves
this with single-pass inference, runtime comparable to routing baselines, and
none of the overheads of iterative aggregation. MoT offers a simple
latent-space mechanism for combining heterogeneous LLMs, a practical step
toward broader multi-LLM collaboration. Our code is publicly available at

*Nicola Novello,Federico Fontana,Luigi Cinque,Deniz Gunduz,Andrea M. Tonello*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified framework based on $f$-divergence for machine unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models, enhancing flexibility in selecting optimal methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine unlearning methods for text-to-image models rely heavily on a mean squared error (MSE) approach, limiting adaptability and efficiency.

Method: The authors propose a generalized $f$-divergence-based framework to analyze and improve unlearning methods, enabling the use of various divergences to optimize results.

Result: The unified framework demonstrates that different $f$-divergences impact algorithm convergence and unlearning quality, offering better adaptability for specific applications.

Conclusion: The framework provides a flexible approach, allowing practitioners to balance trade-offs for effective unlearning while preserving concepts.

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove specific knowledge from a trained model.
While diffusion models (DMs) have shown remarkable generative capabilities,
existing unlearning methods for text-to-image (T2I) models often rely on
minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) between the output distribution of a
target and an anchor concept. We show that this MSE-based approach is a special
case of a unified $f$-divergence-based framework, in which any $f$-divergence
can be utilized. We analyze the benefits of using different $f$-divergences,
that mainly impact the convergence properties of the algorithm and the quality
of unlearning. The proposed unified framework offers a flexible paradigm that
allows to select the optimal divergence for a specific application, balancing
different trade-offs between aggressive unlearning and concept preservation.

*Tian Lan,Hao Duong Le,Jinbo Li,Wenjun He,Meng Wang,Chenghao Liu,Chen Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces TimeRCD, a novel foundation model for time series anomaly detection (TSAD), based on the new Relative Context Discrepancy (RCD) pre-training paradigm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TSAD models that rely on reconstruction-based objectives face challenges in detecting subtle anomalies and interpreting complex normal patterns, leading to false positives and negatives.

Method: TimeRCD utilizes a relational approach by detecting discrepancies between adjacent time windows, implemented with a Transformer architecture and pre-trained on a diverse synthetic corpus with anomaly labels.

Result: Experiments show that TimeRCD outperforms existing models in zero-shot TSAD tasks on various datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalizability.

Conclusion: The RCD paradigm is a more effective approach for TSAD, establishing a promising foundation for building robust and generalizable models for anomaly detection.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is a critical task, but developing
models that generalize to unseen data in a zero-shot manner remains a major
challenge. Prevailing foundation models for TSAD predominantly rely on
reconstruction-based objectives, which suffer from a fundamental objective
mismatch: they struggle to identify subtle anomalies while often
misinterpreting complex normal patterns, leading to high rates of false
negatives and positives. To overcome these limitations, we introduce
\texttt{TimeRCD}, a novel foundation model for TSAD built upon a new
pre-training paradigm: Relative Context Discrepancy (RCD). Instead of learning
to reconstruct inputs, \texttt{TimeRCD} is explicitly trained to identify
anomalies by detecting significant discrepancies between adjacent time windows.
This relational approach, implemented with a standard Transformer architecture,
enables the model to capture contextual shifts indicative of anomalies that
reconstruction-based methods often miss. To facilitate this paradigm, we
develop a large-scale, diverse synthetic corpus with token-level anomaly
labels, providing the rich supervisory signal necessary for effective
pre-training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{TimeRCD}
significantly outperforms existing general-purpose and anomaly-specific
foundation models in zero-shot TSAD across diverse datasets. Our results
validate the superiority of the RCD paradigm and establish a new, effective
path toward building robust and generalizable foundation models for time series
anomaly detection.

*Hao Wu,Yuan Gao,Fan Xu,Fan Zhang,Qingsong Wen,Kun Wang,Xiaomeng Huang,Xian Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new framework, the Differential-Integral Neural Operator (DINO), to address challenges in long-term turbulence forecasting, maintaining stability and physical accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving long-term prediction of turbulent dynamics, a critical challenge in fields like climate modeling and aerospace engineering, where existing deep learning methods fail due to errors and physical inconsistencies.

Method: The authors design DINO using operator decomposition principles. It models local effects through constrained convolutional networks and global interactions using a Transformer-based integral operator.

Result: DINO outperforms existing models in long-term forecasting of turbulence on the 2D Kolmogorov flow benchmark. It suppresses error accumulation over many timesteps and captures precise vorticity fields and energy spectra.

Conclusion: This framework establishes a new standard in turbulence forecasting, showcasing robust stability and accurate long-term predictions.

Abstract: Accurately forecasting the long-term evolution of turbulence represents a
grand challenge in scientific computing and is crucial for applications ranging
from climate modeling to aerospace engineering. Existing deep learning methods,
particularly neural operators, often fail in long-term autoregressive
predictions, suffering from catastrophic error accumulation and a loss of
physical fidelity. This failure stems from their inability to simultaneously
capture the distinct mathematical structures that govern turbulent dynamics:
local, dissipative effects and global, non-local interactions. In this paper,
we propose the
{\textbf{\underline{D}}}ifferential-{\textbf{\underline{I}}}ntegral
{\textbf{\underline{N}}}eural {\textbf{\underline{O}}}perator (\method{}), a
novel framework designed from a first-principles approach of operator
decomposition. \method{} explicitly models the turbulent evolution through
parallel branches that learn distinct physical operators: a local differential
operator, realized by a constrained convolutional network that provably
converges to a derivative, and a global integral operator, captured by a
Transformer architecture that learns a data-driven global kernel. This
physics-based decomposition endows \method{} with exceptional stability and
robustness. Through extensive experiments on the challenging 2D Kolmogorov flow
benchmark, we demonstrate that \method{} significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art models in long-term forecasting. It successfully suppresses
error accumulation over hundreds of timesteps, maintains high fidelity in both
the vorticity fields and energy spectra, and establishes a new benchmark for
physically consistent, long-range turbulence forecast.

TL;DR: The paper reviews the integration of physics-informed machine learning techniques into Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) to address noisy sensor data, limited labels, and system complexities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in PHM, such as noisy or incomplete data, limited labels, and complex system dynamics, and improve fault prediction, maintenance optimization, and fleet-wide scalability.

Method: Embedding physical knowledge into machine learning models via physics-informed loss functions, governing equations, data synthesis strategies (e.g., virtual sensing, simulation), and reinforcement learning.

Result: The reviewed approaches show promise in enhancing predictive reliability, physical consistency, and active decision-making in PHM systems.

Conclusion: Physics-informed machine learning fosters adaptive decision-making and scalable PHM solutions, transitioning from predictive models to system-level operational optimization.

Abstract: Prognostics and Health Management ensures the reliability, safety, and
efficiency of complex engineered systems by enabling fault detection,
anticipating equipment failures, and optimizing maintenance activities
throughout an asset lifecycle. However, real-world PHM presents persistent
challenges: sensor data is often noisy or incomplete, available labels are
limited, and degradation behaviors and system interdependencies can be highly
complex and nonlinear. Physics-informed machine learning has emerged as a
promising approach to address these limitations by embedding physical knowledge
into data-driven models. This review examines how incorporating learning and
observational biases through physics-informed modeling and data strategies can
guide models toward physically consistent and reliable predictions. Learning
biases embed physical constraints into model training through physics-informed
loss functions and governing equations, or by incorporating properties like
monotonicity. Observational biases influence data selection and synthesis to
ensure models capture realistic system behavior through virtual sensing for
estimating unmeasured states, physics-based simulation for data augmentation,
and multi-sensor fusion strategies. The review then examines how these
approaches enable the transition from passive prediction to active
decision-making through reinforcement learning, which allows agents to learn
maintenance policies that respect physical constraints while optimizing
operational objectives. This closes the loop between model-based predictions,
simulation, and actual system operation, empowering adaptive decision-making.
Finally, the review addresses the critical challenge of scaling PHM solutions
from individual assets to fleet-wide deployment. Fast adaptation methods
including meta-learning and few-shot learning are reviewed alongside domain
generalization techniques ...

*Yuxiang Ji,Ziyu Ma,Yong Wang,Guanhua Chen,Xiangxiang Chu,Liaoni Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Tree-GRPO is a novel reinforcement learning method leveraging tree-based search to address sparse supervision in multi-turn tasks for large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome sparse supervision issues in multi-turn agent tasks where RL methods driven solely by outcome rewards fall short.

Method: Uses a tree-based group relative policy optimization technique, wherein tree nodes represent complete interaction steps. The method shares common prefixes for efficient rollouts and constructs step-wise supervised signals using outcome rewards.

Result: Experimental tests across 11 datasets and 3 QA task types show Tree-GRPO's superiority over chain-based RL methods.

Conclusion: Tree-GRPO effectively combines tree-structured trajectories with grouped relative advantages, offering enhanced RL performance in multi-turn tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have significantly enhanced
the agentic capabilities of large language models (LLMs). In long-term and
multi-turn agent tasks, existing approaches driven solely by outcome rewards
often suffer from the problem of sparse supervision. To address the challenge,
we propose Tree-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (Tree-GRPO), a grouped
agent RL method based on tree search, where each tree node represents the
complete agent interaction step. By sharing common prefixes, the tree search
sampling increases the number of rollouts achievable within a fixed budget of
tokens or tool calls. Moreover, we find that the tree-structured trajectory
naturally allows the construction of step-wise process supervised signals even
using only the outcome reward. Based on this, Tree-GRPO estimates the grouped
relative advantages both on intra-tree and inter-tree levels. Through
theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that the objective of intra-tree level
group relative policy optimization is equivalent to that of step-level direct
preference learning. Experiments across 11 datasets and 3 types of QA tasks
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed tree-based RL over the chain-based
RL method.

*Yucheng Wang,Ziyang Chen,Md Faisal Kabir*

TL;DR: The paper explores how fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) change in structural reasoning and semantic behavior, proposing a framework based on counterfactual knowledge graphs to explain these changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the internal mechanisms and impact of fine-tuning in LLMs, especially with methods like LoRA, remains unclear, motivating the need for tools that shed light on these alterations.

Method: The study constructs BioToolKG, a bioinformatics knowledge graph, along with CFFTLLMExplainer, which generates minimal structural changes via soft masking of graph nodes/edges to create semantic divergences, optimized for interpretability.

Result: The proposed framework reveals structural dependencies influenced by fine-tuning LoRA-induced parameters in a LLaMA-based model, showcasing its capability to decipher internal LLM behavior.

Conclusion: Counterfactual graphs emerge as a promising strategy in interpretable AI, providing insights into how fine-tuning impacts the structural and semantic dynamics of LLMs.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has enabled large
language models (LLMs) to acquire domain-specific knowledge with remarkable
efficiency. However, understanding how such a fine-tuning mechanism alters a
model's structural reasoning and semantic behavior remains an open challenge.
This work introduces a novel framework that explains fine-tuned LLMs via
counterfactuals grounded in knowledge graphs. Specifically, we construct
BioToolKG, a domain-specific heterogeneous knowledge graph in bioinformatics
tools and design a counterfactual-based fine-tuned LLMs explainer
(CFFTLLMExplainer) that learns soft masks over graph nodes and edges to
generate minimal structural perturbations that induce maximum semantic
divergence. Our method jointly optimizes structural sparsity and semantic
divergence while enforcing interpretability preserving constraints such as
entropy regularization and edge smoothness. We apply this framework to a
fine-tuned LLaMA-based LLM and reveal that counterfactual masking exposes the
model's structural dependencies and aligns with LoRA-induced parameter shifts.
This work provides new insights into the internal mechanisms of fine-tuned LLMs
and highlights counterfactual graphs as a potential tool for interpretable AI.

*Zifan Wang,Anqi Dong,Mahmoud Selim,Michael M. Zavlanos,Karl H. Johansson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Federated Flow Matching (FFM), a framework for training generative models on decentralized data while preserving privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With data being decentralized and restricted due to privacy and ownership regulations, there is a need to train generative models directly from distributed data without central aggregation.

Method: The authors propose FFM with three strategies: FFM-vanilla (local training with privacy preservation), FFM-LOT (local optimal transport with better flow straightness but no global consistency), and FFM-GOT (global coordination via a shared potential function for improved consistency).

Result: Experiments showed that FFM achieves privacy-preserving training and significantly improves flow straightness and sample quality, performing comparably to centralized approaches.

Conclusion: FFM provides an effective solution for training generative models in federated environments, balancing privacy, local computation, and global coordination.

Abstract: Data today is decentralized, generated and stored across devices and
institutions where privacy, ownership, and regulation prevent centralization.
This motivates the need to train generative models directly from distributed
data locally without central aggregation. In this paper, we introduce Federated
Flow Matching (FFM), a framework for training flow matching models under
privacy constraints. Specifically, we first examine FFM-vanilla, where each
client trains locally with independent source and target couplings, preserving
privacy but yielding curved flows that slow inference. We then develop FFM-LOT,
which employs local optimal transport couplings to improve straightness within
each client but lacks global consistency under heterogeneous data. Finally, we
propose FFM-GOT, a federated strategy based on the semi-dual formulation of
optimal transport, where a shared global potential function coordinates
couplings across clients. Experiments on synthetic and image datasets show that
FFM enables privacy-preserving training while enhancing both the flow
straightness and sample quality in federated settings, with performance
comparable to the centralized baseline.

TL;DR: AirPCM is a deep spatiotemporal forecasting model designed for accurate and interpretable multi-pollutant air quality predictions across diverse regions and scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Air pollution poses significant risks to health, sustainability, and climate stability, and accurate forecasting is hindered by complex pollutant dynamics and spatial heterogeneity.

Method: AirPCM integrates cross-station spatial correlations, temporal auto-correlations, and meteorology-pollutant causality into a unified deep learning model for multi-pollutant forecasting.

Result: AirPCM outperforms existing models in predictive accuracy and generalization across various real-world datasets, offering detailed forecasts for future air quality trends.

Conclusion: The model enables evidence-based environmental governance and carbon mitigation planning by providing reliable predictions for air quality management and intervention strategies.

Abstract: Air pollution, a pressing global problem, threatens public health,
environmental sustainability, and climate stability. Achieving accurate and
scalable forecasting across spatially distributed monitoring stations is
challenging due to intricate multi-pollutant interactions, evolving
meteorological conditions, and region specific spatial heterogeneity. To
address this challenge, we propose AirPCM, a novel deep spatiotemporal
forecasting model that integrates multi-region, multi-pollutant dynamics with
explicit meteorology-pollutant causality modeling. Unlike existing methods
limited to single pollutants or localized regions, AirPCM employs a unified
architecture to jointly capture cross-station spatial correlations, temporal
auto-correlations, and meteorology-pollutant dynamic causality. This empowers
fine-grained, interpretable multi-pollutant forecasting across varying
geographic and temporal scales, including sudden pollution episodes. Extensive
evaluations on multi-scale real-world datasets demonstrate that AirPCM
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in both predictive accuracy
and generalization capability. Moreover, the long-term forecasting capability
of AirPCM provides actionable insights into future air quality trends and
potential high-risk windows, offering timely support for evidence-based

*Madeleine Dwyer,Adam Sobey,Adriane Chapman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PSPO (Probability Smoothing Policy Optimisation), an alternative to ratio clipping in RL, which maintains gradient continuity and stabilizes updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the drawbacks of ratio clipping methods like PPO, which discard information and disrupt gradient continuity during RL fine-tuning of large language models.

Method: The authors propose PSPO, designed to smooth the policy probabilities towards the behavior policy before importance ratio computation. This method leverages interpolation to create a soft trust region, ensuring stability and preserving learning signals.

Result: PSPO, integrated as GR-PSPO, achieves significant performance gains over clipped GRPO. It improves reasoning clarity and boosts GSM8K test accuracy by over 20% for Qwen2.5 models with 0.5B and 1.5B parameters.

Conclusion: PSPO effectively combines stability and gradient preservation in RL-based fine-tuning, offering advantages over traditional clipping methods. It enhances both model performance and reasoning quality, demonstrating its potential in advancing LLM training.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning (RL)
methods such as PPO and GRPO commonly relies on ratio clipping to stabilise
updates. While effective at preventing instability, clipping discards
information and introduces gradient discontinuities. We propose Probability
Smoothing Policy Optimisation (PSPO), which smooths the current policy's
probabilities toward the old (behaviour) policy before computing the importance
ratio, analogous to label smoothing. Unlike clipping, PSPO preserves gradient
signal, while interpolation toward the old policy creates a soft trust region
that discourages large, destabilising updates, with formal guarantees.
  We instantiate PSPO within GRPO (GR-PSPO) and fine-tune Qwen2.5-0.5B and
Qwen2.5-1.5B on GSM8K, evaluating on GSM8K test and the cross-dataset
generalisation on SVAMP, ASDiv, and MATH-500. Relative to unclipped GRPO
(single iteration; no data reuse, ratio always = 1), GR-PSPO achieves similar
performance but improves the reasoning leading to clearer and more concise
responses which are more logical. Compared to clipped GRPO, GR-PSPO
substantially improves performance both the 0.5B and 1.5B models, with a boost
of over 20% on GSM8K (39.7% vs. 17.6% for 0.5B, 59.4% vs. 37.8% for 1.5B).

*Phone Kyaw,Kshitij Kayastha,Shahin Jabbari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new algorithm for optimal robust recourse under $L^p$ norm changes, achieving lower costs and better trade-offs than prior work.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the issue of recourse recommendations becoming invalid due to model updates, specifically developing a robust recourse algorithm with lower costs under constrained model changes.

Method: The method involves creating an algorithm for robust recourse computation under $L^p$ norm constrained changes, providing theoretical guarantees of optimality.

Result: The algorithm achieves significantly lower recourse costs (up to several orders of magnitude), better cost-validity trade-offs, and ensures sparser recourse solutions compared to previous approaches.

Conclusion: The paper concludes the proposed algorithm effectively enhances the robustness, cost-efficiency, and sparsity of recourse recommendations in algorithmic decision-making.

Abstract: Recourse provides individuals who received undesirable labels (e.g., denied a
loan) from algorithmic decision-making systems with a minimum-cost improvement
suggestion to achieve the desired outcome. However, in practice, models often
get updated to reflect changes in the data distribution or environment,
invalidating the recourse recommendations (i.e., following the recourse will
not lead to the desirable outcome). The robust recourse literature addresses
this issue by providing a framework for computing recourses whose validity is
resilient to slight changes in the model. However, since the optimization
problem of computing robust recourse is non-convex (even for linear models),
most of the current approaches do not have any theoretical guarantee on the
optimality of the recourse. Recent work by Kayastha et. al. provides the first
provably optimal algorithm for robust recourse with respect to generalized
linear models when the model changes are measured using the $L^{\infty}$ norm.
However, using the $L^{\infty}$ norm can lead to recourse solutions with a high
price. To address this shortcoming, we consider more constrained model changes
defined by the $L^p$ norm, where $p\geq 1$ but $p\neq \infty$, and provide a
new algorithm that provably computes the optimal robust recourse for
generalized linear models. Empirically, for both linear and non-linear models,
we demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a significantly lower price of
recourse (up to several orders of magnitude) compared to prior work and also
exhibits a better trade-off between the implementation cost of recourse and its
validity. Our empirical analysis also illustrates that our approach provides
more sparse recourses compared to prior work and remains resilient to
post-processing approaches that guarantee feasibility.

### [315] [Dual-Language General-Purpose Self-Hosted Visual Language and new Textual Programming Language for Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20426)
*Mahmoud Samir Fayed*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The study introduces PWCT2, a self-hosting, general-purpose visual programming language, developed using the Ring programming language. PWCT2 improves code efficiency and reduces storage requirements, achieving positive user feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The main motivation was to overcome limitations of existing general-purpose visual programming languages like PWCT, which required textual programming for improvements. The aim was to create a self-hosting VPL that simplifies and elevates development workflows.

Method: The researchers designed and implemented PWCT2 by first creating the Ring programming language. Ring allowed the team to develop a self-hosting visual programming language with enhanced features. They used PWCT to develop Ring, identified issues, and subsequently resolved them while creating PWCT2. PWCT2 was designed with 92,000 lines of Ring code and includes 394 visual components.

Result: PWCT2 achieved significant improvements such as 36 times faster code generation and 20 times less storage use for visual files. The software has been distributed via Steam, where 1772 users collectively used it for over 17,000 hours, with positive feedback.

Conclusion: The development of PWCT2 showcases the benefits of combining a self-hosting VPL with a textual programming language like Ring. This advance simplifies development, delivers performance improvements, and offers a promising tool for future research and development.

Abstract: Most visual programming languages (VPLs) are domain-specific, with few
general-purpose VPLs like Programming Without Coding Technology (PWCT). These
general-purpose VPLs are developed using textual programming languages and
improving them requires textual programming. In this thesis, we designed and
developed PWCT2, a dual-language (Arabic/English), general-purpose,
self-hosting visual programming language. Before doing so, we specifically
designed a textual programming language called Ring for its development. Ring
is a dynamically typed language with a lightweight implementation, offering
syntax customization features. It permits the creation of domain-specific
languages through new features that extend object-oriented programming,
allowing for specialized languages resembling Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) or
Supernova language. The Ring Compiler and Virtual Machine are designed using
the PWCT visual programming language where the visual implementation is
composed of 18,945 components that generate 24,743 lines of C code, which
increases the abstraction level and hides unnecessary details. Using PWCT to
develop Ring allowed us to realize several issues in PWCT, which led to the
development of the PWCT2 visual programming language using the Ring textual
programming language. PWCT2 provides approximately 36 times faster code
generation and requires 20 times less storage for visual source files. It also

*Bowen Zhu,Aayush Sabharwal,Songchen Tan,Yingbo Ma,Alan Edelman,Christopher Rackauckas*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: This paper presents the integration of hash consing into JuliaSymbolics, optimizing symbolic computation by reducing memory usage, accelerating multiple operations, and enabling smoother interaction with computational frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address memory inefficiencies and expression swell in symbolic computation, which adversely impacts performance in both classical and AI-driven mathematical reasoning systems.

Method: The authors integrate hash consing into JuliaSymbolics using a global weak-reference hash table to canonicalize and eliminate redundant expressions, thereby reducing duplication.

Result: The implementation led to significant improvements in computation speed (up to 3.2x), memory reductions (up to 2x), and faster numerical evaluations (up to 100x for larger models). However, workloads with fewer duplicates showed modest or negligible benefits.

Conclusion: Hash consing is pivotal in scaling symbolic computation, with promising applications in AI-driven tools, particularly when combined with e-graphs for enhanced equivalence-aware sharing in future development.

Abstract: Symbolic computation systems suffer from memory inefficiencies due to
redundant storage of structurally identical subexpressions, commonly known as
expression swell, which degrades performance in both classical computer algebra
and emerging AI-driven mathematical reasoning tools. In this paper, we present
the first integration of hash consing into JuliaSymbolics, a high-performance
symbolic toolkit in Julia, by employing a global weak-reference hash table that
canonicalizes expressions and eliminates duplication. This approach reduces
memory consumption and accelerates key operations such as differentiation,
simplification, and code generation, while seamlessly integrating with Julia's
metaprogramming and just-in-time compilation infrastructure. Benchmark
evaluations across different computational domains reveal substantial
improvements: symbolic computations are accelerated by up to 3.2 times, memory
usage is reduced by up to 2 times, code generation is up to 5 times faster,
function compilation up to 10 times faster, and numerical evaluation up to 100
times faster for larger models. While certain workloads with fewer duplicate
unknown-variable expressions show more modest gains or even slight overhead in
initial computation stages, downstream processing consistently benefits
significantly. These findings underscore the importance of hash consing in
scaling symbolic computation and pave the way for future work integrating hash
consing with e-graphs for enhanced equivalence-aware expression sharing in
AI-driven pipelines.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a multimodal approach that integrates semantic camera data with LiDAR segmentation to improve LiDAR-based localization for autonomous systems, validated through rigorous real-world testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR-based localization faces challenges due to diverse sensor setups, and using semantic data can help improve its accuracy and robustness, which is crucial for autonomous navigation.

Method: The proposed method projects LiDAR points into the semantic space of camera data to enhance LiDAR localization. It employs the Depth-Anything network for camera segmentation and an adaptive network for LiDAR segmentation, using GNSS with RTK for ground truth.

Result: An extensive 55 km real-world test in Karlsruhe, Germany, demonstrated the reliability and precision of the approach across varied environments, including urban, multi-lane, and rural settings.

Conclusion: The multimodal approach enhances the accuracy and reliability of LiDAR-based localization, contributing to the development of more robust autonomous navigation systems in complex environments.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of LiDAR data presents considerable challenges,
particularly when dealing with diverse sensor types and configurations.
However, incorporating semantic information can significantly enhance the
accuracy and robustness of LiDAR-based localization techniques for autonomous
mobile systems. We propose an approach that integrates semantic camera data
with LiDAR segmentation to address this challenge. By projecting LiDAR points
into the semantic segmentation space of the camera, our method enhances the
precision and reliability of the LiDAR-based localization pipeline.
  For validation, we utilize the CoCar NextGen platform from the FZI Research
Center for Information Technology, which offers diverse sensor modalities and
configurations. The sensor setup of CoCar NextGen enables a thorough analysis
of different sensor types. Our evaluation leverages the state-of-the-art
Depth-Anything network for camera image segmentation and an adaptive
segmentation network for LiDAR segmentation. To establish a reliable ground
truth for LiDAR-based localization, we make us of a Global Navigation Satellite
System (GNSS) solution with Real-Time Kinematic corrections (RTK).
Additionally, we conduct an extensive 55 km drive through the city of
Karlsruhe, Germany, covering a variety of environments, including urban areas,
multi-lane roads, and rural highways. This multimodal approach paves the way
for more reliable and precise autonomous navigation systems, particularly in
complex real-world environments.

*Boqi Li,Siyuan Li,Weiyi Wang,Anran Li,Zhong Cao,Henry X. Liu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper tackles vision-language navigation (VLN) in continuous environments by integrating a waypoint predictor with a multimodal large language model (MLLM), achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language navigation is important for embodied agents to operate in complex environments using natural language instructions, offering practical applications in robotics.

Method: The authors propose a zero-shot framework using a waypoint predictor on an abstract obstacle map, paired with a dynamically updated topological graph. This graph encodes spatial and historical exploration data into MLLM prompts for reasoning and path correction.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot success rates in VLN tasks, reaching 41% on R2R-CE and 36% on RxR-CE benchmarks, surpassing previous methods.

Conclusion: The integration of spatial graph modeling and multimodal language models significantly enhances VLN performance, showcasing the potential of zero-shot frameworks in complex navigation tasks.

Abstract: With the rapid progress of foundation models and robotics, vision-language
navigation (VLN) has emerged as a key task for embodied agents with broad
practical applications. We address VLN in continuous environments, a
particularly challenging setting where an agent must jointly interpret natural
language instructions, perceive its surroundings, and plan low-level actions.
We propose a zero-shot framework that integrates a simplified yet effective
waypoint predictor with a multimodal large language model (MLLM). The predictor
operates on an abstract obstacle map, producing linearly reachable waypoints,
which are incorporated into a dynamically updated topological graph with
explicit visitation records. The graph and visitation information are encoded
into the prompt, enabling reasoning over both spatial structure and exploration
history to encourage exploration and equip MLLM with local path planning for
error correction. Extensive experiments on R2R-CE and RxR-CE show that our
method achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, with success rates of
41% and 36%, respectively, outperforming prior state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces MELEGROS, a 3D-printed, pneumatically actuated soft robotic gripper inspired by the African elephant trunk, integrating optical sensors and capable of versatile bioinspired manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a soft robotic gripper with integrated capabilities for sensing, actuation, and structure inspired by the multifunctionality of the elephant trunk.

Method: Developed MELEGROS using a monolithic 3D printing process with soft resin, incorporating six optical sensors and five pneumatic chambers into a single, continuous lattice structure.

Result: MELEGROS achieves elongation, compression, and bending, handles fragile items, lifts twice its own weight, and performs various bio-inspired actions. The integrated optical sensors enable tactile and proprioceptive sensing.

Conclusion: MELEGROS showcases a new direction in soft robotics with seamless integration of structure, actuation, and sensing, paving the way for advanced bioinspired robotic systems.

Abstract: The elephant trunk exemplifies a natural gripper where structure, actuation,
and sensing are seamlessly integrated. Inspired by the distal morphology of the
African elephant trunk, we present MELEGROS, a Monolithic ELEphant-inspired
GRipper with Optical Sensors, emphasizing sensing as an intrinsic,
co-fabricated capability. Unlike multi-material or tendon-based approaches,
MELEGROS directly integrates six optical waveguide sensors and five pneumatic
chambers into a pneumatically actuated lattice structure (12.5 mm cell size)
using a single soft resin and one continuous 3D print. This eliminates
mechanical mismatches between sensors, actuators, and body, reducing model
uncertainty and enabling simulation-guided sensor design and placement. Only
four iterations were required to achieve the final prototype, which features a
continuous structure capable of elongation, compression, and bending while
decoupling tactile and proprioceptive signals. MELEGROS (132 g) lifts more than
twice its weight, performs bioinspired actions such as pinching, scooping, and
reaching, and delicately grasps fragile items like grapes. The integrated
optical sensors provide distinct responses to touch, bending, and chamber
deformation, enabling multifunctional perception. MELEGROS demonstrates a new
paradigm for soft robotics where fully embedded sensing and continuous
structures inherently support versatile, bioinspired manipulation.

*Prasanna Sriganesh,Barath Satheeshkumar,Anushree Sabnis,Matthew Travers*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper discusses a novel method for quadrupedal robots to autonomously navigate cluttered environments by safely interacting with obstacles using a tightly coupled perception-action framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots require robust methods to interact with obstacles when navigating densely cluttered areas, such as stairs, where direct physical manipulation is necessary for safety and effectiveness.

Method: The authors developed a perception-action framework incorporating an interaction-aware state estimation loop. This loop uses proprioceptive feedback to predict object displacement during occlusion and re-detect displaced objects, enabling robust control during pushing maneuvers.

Result: Experimental results on the Boston Dynamics Spot robot demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves task success rates and object tracking accuracy when clearing obstacles on stairs compared to traditional open-loop methods.

Conclusion: The tightly coupled perception-action framework enhances the robot's capacity to navigate cluttered environments by enabling reliable obstacle interaction, making it more adaptable and efficient in challenging terrains.

Abstract: For robots to operate autonomously in densely cluttered environments, they
must reason about and potentially physically interact with obstacles to clear a
path. Safely clearing a path on challenging terrain, such as a cluttered
staircase, requires controlled interaction. For example, a quadrupedal robot
that pushes objects out of the way with one leg while maintaining a stable
stance with its three other legs. However, tightly coupled physical actions,
such as one-legged pushing, create new constraints on the system that can be
difficult to predict at design time. In this work, we present a new method that
addresses one such constraint, wherein the object being pushed by a quadrupedal
robot with one of its legs becomes occluded from the robot's sensors during
manipulation. To address this challenge, we present a tightly coupled
perception-action framework that enables the robot to perceive clutter, reason
about feasible push paths, and execute the clearing maneuver. Our core
contribution is an interaction-aware state estimation loop that uses
proprioceptive feedback regarding foot contact and leg position to predict an
object's displacement during the occlusion. This prediction guides the
perception system to robustly re-detect the object after the interaction,
closing the loop between action and sensing to enable accurate tracking even
after partial pushes. Using this feedback allows the robot to learn from
physical outcomes, reclassifying an object as immovable if a push fails due to
it being too heavy. We present results of implementing our approach on a Boston
Dynamics Spot robot that show our interaction-aware approach achieves higher
task success rates and tracking accuracy in pushing objects on stairs compared
to open-loop baselines.

### [322] [Selective Progress-Aware Querying for Human-in-the-Loop Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20541)
*Anujith Muraleedharan,Anamika J H*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPARQ, a selective query policy to optimize human feedback in robot learning, achieving significant efficiency with fewer human inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current HiL-RL methods often require abundant, costly human feedback, limiting their practicality in real-world settings. The study aims to improve feedback efficiency.

Method: SPARQ introduces a progress-aware query policy that selectively requests human feedback only when learning stagnates or worsens. The policy is evaluated on a simulated robot task against various baselines.

Result: SPARQ demonstrates near-perfect task success comparable to always querying, while halving the feedback requirement. It also outperforms random and no-feedback methods in stability and efficiency.

Conclusion: Progress-based feedback requests, like SPARQ, enhance the scalability and efficiency of human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning, making it viable under constrained human effort.

Abstract: Human feedback can greatly accelerate robot learning, but in real-world
settings, such feedback is costly and limited. Existing human-in-the-loop
reinforcement learning (HiL-RL) methods often assume abundant feedback,
limiting their practicality for physical robot deployment. In this work, we
introduce SPARQ, a progress-aware query policy that requests feedback only when
learning stagnates or worsens, thereby reducing unnecessary oracle calls. We
evaluate SPARQ on a simulated UR5 cube-picking task in PyBullet, comparing
against three baselines: no feedback, random querying, and always querying. Our
experiments show that SPARQ achieves near-perfect task success, matching the
performance of always querying while consuming about half the feedback budget.
It also provides more stable and efficient learning than random querying, and
significantly improves over training without feedback. These findings suggest
that selective, progress-based query strategies can make HiL-RL more efficient
and scalable for robots operating under realistic human effort constraints.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GraspFactory, a dataset with over 109 million robot grasps for diverse objects, enabling better generalization of robotic grasping models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of robotic grasping models failing to generalize to diverse and novel objects in real-world industrial environments.

Method: Developing GraspFactory, a large-scale dataset designed for training and evaluating generalizable robotic grasping models, with 6-DoF grasps for two gripper types across thousands of objects.

Result: Demonstrated that a model trained on a subset of GraspFactory exhibited strong generalization capabilities in both simulation and real-world environments.

Conclusion: GraspFactory offers a valuable resource for building and testing generalizable robotic grasping models, with its tools and dataset available openly for further research.

Abstract: Robotic grasping is a crucial task in industrial automation, where robots are
increasingly expected to handle a wide range of objects. However, a significant
challenge arises when robot grasping models trained on limited datasets
encounter novel objects. In real-world environments such as warehouses or
manufacturing plants, the diversity of objects can be vast, and grasping models
need to generalize to this diversity. Training large, generalizable
robot-grasping models requires geometrically diverse datasets. In this paper,
we introduce GraspFactory, a dataset containing over 109 million 6-DoF grasps
collectively for the Franka Panda (with 14,690 objects) and Robotiq 2F-85
grippers (with 33,710 objects). GraspFactory is designed for training
data-intensive models, and we demonstrate the generalization capabilities of
one such model trained on a subset of GraspFactory in both simulated and
real-world settings. The dataset and tools are made available for download at

TL;DR: This paper develops an uncertainty-aware tracking framework for USVs to locate marine pollution sources using real-time data and advanced techniques, achieving reliable and accurate results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the ability of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) in identifying marine pollution sources autonomously and accurately, addressing the challenges posed by uncertainty in real-world environmental monitoring.

Method: The framework integrates advanced marine pollution dispersion simulation and informative path planning techniques, processes real-time sensor data via Robot Operating System (ROS), and progressively updates probabilistic location estimates while quantifying prediction uncertainty.

Result: Experiments in simulated environments confirm the framework's high accuracy in localizing pollution sources under diverse conditions, showcasing its reliability and efficiency.

Conclusion: The research provides a significant step towards fully autonomous environmental monitoring systems that are crucial for rapid and accurate responses to marine pollution incidents.

Abstract: This paper proposes an uncertainty-aware marine pollution source tracking
framework for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). By integrating high-fidelity
marine pollution dispersion simulation with informative path planning
techniques, we demonstrate effective identification of pollution sources in
marine environments. The proposed approach is implemented based on Robot

probabilistic source location estimates. The system progressively refines the
estimation of source location while quantifying uncertainty levels in its
predictions. Experiments conducted in simulated environments with varying
source locations, flow conditions, and starting positions demonstrate the
framework's ability to localise pollution sources with high accuracy. Results
show that the proposed approach achieves reliable source localisation
efficiently. This work contributes to the development of full autonomous
environmental monitoring capabilities essential for rapid response to marine

*Satyajeet Das,Darren Chiu,Zhehui Huang,Lars Lindemann,Gaurav S. Sukhatme*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces Latent Activation Editing (LAE) as a lightweight technique to improve the safety of reinforcement learning policies at inference time, reducing quadrotor collisions without modifying pre-trained policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address safety vulnerabilities of reinforcement learning policies in obstacle-rich environments, especially without costly retraining or fine-tuning.

Method: LAE operates by using an online classifier to detect risky behaviors in intermediate activations and an editing module to shift the policy toward safer actions. A latent collision world model is used to predict pre-collision activations for proactive avoidance.

Result: LAE significantly reduces collisions by nearly 90%, increases collision-free trajectories, and maintains task completion capabilities in both simulations and real-world quadrotor experiments.

Conclusion: LAE provides a resource-efficient solution for enhancing the safety of learned quadrotor policies in real-world deployment without altering their architecture or weights.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has enabled significant progress in complex domains
such as coordinating and navigating multiple quadrotors. However, even
well-trained policies remain vulnerable to collisions in obstacle-rich
environments. Addressing these infrequent but critical safety failures through
retraining or fine-tuning is costly and risks degrading previously learned
skills. Inspired by activation steering in large language models and latent
editing in computer vision, we introduce a framework for inference-time Latent
Activation Editing (LAE) that refines the behavior of pre-trained policies
without modifying their weights or architecture. The framework operates in two
stages: (i) an online classifier monitors intermediate activations to detect
states associated with undesired behaviors, and (ii) an activation editing
module that selectively modifies flagged activations to shift the policy
towards safer regimes. In this work, we focus on improving safety in
multi-quadrotor navigation. We hypothesize that amplifying a policy's internal
perception of risk can induce safer behaviors. We instantiate this idea through
a latent collision world model trained to predict future pre-collision
activations, thereby prompting earlier and more cautious avoidance responses.
Extensive simulations and real-world Crazyflie experiments demonstrate that LAE
achieves statistically significant reduction in collisions (nearly 90% fewer
cumulative collisions compared to the unedited baseline) and substantially
increases the fraction of collision-free trajectories, while preserving task
completion. More broadly, our results establish LAE as a lightweight paradigm,
feasible on resource-constrained hardware, for post-deployment refinement of
learned robot policies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Legged robots need to navigate complex and unstructured terrains effectively, which becomes particularly challenging without terrain information.

Method: A hierarchical reinforcement learning framework combining terrain-specialized policies and curriculum learning is introduced to tackle the problem.

Result: The proposed method showed up to a 16% improvement in success rate compared to a generalist policy in simulations and displayed enhanced tracking performance on low-friction and discontinuous terrains.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates superior adaptability and robustness for legged robots in mixed-terrain environments, especially under challenging conditions.

Abstract: Legged robots must exhibit robust and agile locomotion across diverse,

*Sun Zhaole,Xiaofeng Mao,Jihong Zhu,Yuanlong Zhang,Robert B. Fisher*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces the SLeap Hand, a robotic hand using fingertip suction cups to enable stable, suction-based dexterity, surpassing human-like paradigms in robotic manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional robotic hands modeled after human mechanics face limitations in task capacity and data collection, stemming from the complexity of force-closure grasps.

Method: The SLeap Hand uses fingertip suction cups, replacing complex multi-point grasp mechanics with single-point adhesion for simpler data collection and improved manipulation capabilities.

Result: The design enables the execution of novel skills, such as one-handed paper cutting and in-hand writing, outperforming standard anthropomorphic approaches in certain tasks.

Conclusion: Moving beyond human-like designs, robotic embodiments like the SLeap Hand can simplify manipulation, ease data collection, and unlock tasks requiring advanced dexterity.

Abstract: Dexterous in-hand manipulation remains a foundational challenge in robotics,
with progress often constrained by the prevailing paradigm of imitating the
human hand. This anthropomorphic approach creates two critical barriers: 1) it
limits robotic capabilities to tasks humans can already perform, and 2) it
makes data collection for learning-based methods exceedingly difficult. Both
challenges are caused by traditional force-closure which requires coordinating
complex, multi-point contacts based on friction, normal force, and gravity to
grasp an object. This makes teleoperated demonstrations unstable and amplifies
the sim-to-real gap for reinforcement learning. In this work, we propose a
paradigm shift: moving away from replicating human mechanics toward the design
of novel robotic embodiments. We introduce the \textbf{S}uction
\textbf{Leap}-Hand (SLeap Hand), a multi-fingered hand featuring integrated
fingertip suction cups that realize a new form of suction-enabled dexterity. By
replacing complex force-closure grasps with stable, single-point adhesion, our
design fundamentally simplifies in-hand teleoperation and facilitates the
collection of high-quality demonstration data. More importantly, this
suction-based embodiment unlocks a new class of dexterous skills that are
difficult or even impossible for the human hand, such as one-handed paper
cutting and in-hand writing. Our work demonstrates that by moving beyond
anthropomorphic constraints, novel embodiments can not only lower the barrier
for collecting robust manipulation data but also enable the stable,
single-handed completion of tasks that would typically require two human hands.

*Congkai Shen,Siyuan Yu,Yifan Weng,Haoran Ma,Chen Li,Hiroshi Yasuda,James Dallas,Michael Thompson,John Subosits,Tulga Ersal*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a haptic shared control framework to teach human drivers advanced high-performance driving skills (e.g., racing or obstacle avoidance) by collaborating with an autonomous driving system. Results show improved skill acquisition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the gap in existing shared control frameworks which have not focused on their potential to improve skill acquisition for complex tasks (like high-performance driving), despite their established benefits for performance and safety.

Method: The paper proposes a 'cyber racing coach' framework. It features a cooperative autonomous driving system and a haptic shared control mechanism that uses a fading scheme to gradually reduce steering assistance based on driver performance. Two benchmarks are compared: self-learning and full assistance training.

Result: The human subject study demonstrates that the proposed framework significantly enhances human drivers' racing skills and performance consistency when compared to self-learning or full assistance methods.

Conclusion: The findings validate the framework's ability to accelerate the acquisition of advanced driving skills, showcasing its potential for training human drivers effectively in high-performance and safety-critical scenarios.

Abstract: This study introduces a haptic shared control framework designed to teach
human drivers advanced driving skills. In this context, shared control refers
to a driving mode where the human driver collaborates with an autonomous
driving system to control the steering of a vehicle simultaneously. Advanced
driving skills are those necessary to safely push the vehicle to its handling
limits in high-performance driving such as racing and emergency obstacle
avoidance. Previous research has demonstrated the performance and safety
benefits of shared control schemes using both subjective and objective
evaluations. However, these schemes have not been assessed for their impact on
skill acquisition on complex and demanding tasks. Prior research on long-term
skill acquisition either applies haptic shared control to simple tasks or
employs other feedback methods like visual and auditory aids. To bridge this
gap, this study creates a cyber racing coach framework based on the haptic
shared control paradigm and evaluates its performance in helping human drivers
acquire high-performance driving skills. The framework introduces (1) an
autonomous driving system that is capable of cooperating with humans in a
highly performant driving scenario; and (2) a haptic shared control mechanism
along with a fading scheme to gradually reduce the steering assistance from
autonomy based on the human driver's performance during training. Two
benchmarks are considered: self-learning (no assistance) and full assistance
during training. Results from a human subject study indicate that the proposed
framework helps human drivers develop superior racing skills compared to the
benchmarks, resulting in better performance and consistency.

*Junzhe Wang,Jiarui Xie,Pengfei Hao,Zheng Li,Yi Cai*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a closed-loop Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) system using EEG, augmented reality (AR), and robotic grasping to achieve intuitive human-robot interaction, especially for motor-impaired individuals. It demonstrates robust performance and improved user control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing BCI-Robot systems face challenges such as the instability of EEG signals, lack of flexible target selection, and limited real-world validation, which restrict their deployment in assistive applications.

Method: The framework integrates motor imagery (MI)-based EEG decoding for brain signal detection, AR neurofeedback using a smartphone for stability and navigation, and robotic decision-making combined with visual pose estimation to autonomously grasp objects.

Result: The system achieved high MI decoding accuracy (93.1%), enhanced information transfer rates (up to 21.3 bit/min with AR feedback), and an excellent closed-loop grasping success rate (97.2%). AR feedback notably stabilized EEG-based control.

Conclusion: The proposed BCI-AR-Robot system demonstrates robust zero-touch robotic capabilities with significant improvements in stability and user control, making strides toward practical assistive robotic applications and improved human-robot interaction.

Abstract: Reliable brain-computer interface (BCI) control of robots provides an
intuitive and accessible means of human-robot interaction, particularly
valuable for individuals with motor impairments. However, existing BCI-Robot
systems face major limitations: electroencephalography (EEG) signals are noisy
and unstable, target selection is often predefined and inflexible, and most
studies remain restricted to simulation without closed-loop validation. These
issues hinder real-world deployment in assistive scenarios. To address them, we
propose a closed-loop BCI-AR-Robot system that integrates motor imagery
(MI)-based EEG decoding, augmented reality (AR) neurofeedback, and robotic
grasping for zero-touch operation. A 14-channel EEG headset enabled
individualized MI calibration, a smartphone-based AR interface supported
multi-target navigation with direction-congruent feedback to enhance stability,
and the robotic arm combined decision outputs with vision-based pose estimation
for autonomous grasping. Experiments are conducted to validate the framework:
MI training achieved 93.1 percent accuracy with an average information transfer
rate (ITR) of 14.8 bit/min; AR neurofeedback significantly improved sustained
control (SCI = 0.210) and achieved the highest ITR (21.3 bit/min) compared with
static, sham, and no-AR baselines; and closed-loop grasping achieved a 97.2
percent success rate with good efficiency and strong user-reported control.
These results show that AR feedback substantially stabilizes EEG-based control
and that the proposed framework enables robust zero-touch grasping, advancing

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a reliable odometry solution in GPS-denied environments as current LiDAR and camera solutions have limitations in extreme weather.

Method: Equi-RO uses pre-processed Doppler velocity features and a graph-based architecture with separate networks for equivariant and invariant feature processing.

Result: Experiments on datasets demonstrate that Equi-RO achieves 10.7% and 20.0% better translation and rotation accuracy than the best baseline.

Conclusion: Equi-RO offers a significant improvement in radar odometry, making it a viable alternative for harsh environmental conditions.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles and robots rely on accurate odometry estimation in
GPS-denied environments. While LiDARs and cameras struggle under extreme
weather, 4D mmWave radar emerges as a robust alternative with all-weather
operability and velocity measurement. In this paper, we introduce Equi-RO, an
equivariant network-based framework for 4D radar odometry. Our algorithm
pre-processes Doppler velocity into invariant node and edge features in the
graph, and employs separate networks for equivariant and invariant feature
processing. A graph-based architecture enhances feature aggregation in sparse
radar data, improving inter-frame correspondence. Experiments on the
open-source dataset and self-collected dataset show Equi-RO outperforms
state-of-the-art algorithms in accuracy and robustness. Overall, our method
achieves 10.7% and 20.0% relative improvements in translation and rotation
accuracy, respectively, compared to the best baseline on the open-source
dataset.

*Wei-Teng Chu,Tianyi Zhang,Matthew Johnson-Roberson,Weiming Zhi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces FINS, a rapid method for implicit surface reconstruction from a single image, outperforming previous models in speed and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing implicit surface reconstruction methods that require multi-view images and long training times.

Method: The proposed FINS framework combines multi-resolution hash grid encoding with lightweight geometry and color modules, using pre-trained models and efficient optimization to enable fast, accurate surface reconstruction from single images.

Result: The experiments revealed that FINS surpasses state-of-the-art methods in speed and accuracy when reconstructing surfaces and SDF fields, and demonstrated its practicality for robotics applications.

Conclusion: FINS is a highly efficient tool that offers significant advantages in implicit surface reconstruction and has broad applicability in robotics and various datasets.

Abstract: Implicit representations have been widely applied in robotics for obstacle
avoidance and path planning. In this paper, we explore the problem of
constructing an implicit distance representation from a single image. Past
methods for implicit surface reconstruction, such as \emph{NeuS} and its
variants generally require a large set of multi-view images as input, and
require long training times. In this work, we propose Fast Image-to-Neural
Surface (FINS), a lightweight framework that can reconstruct high-fidelity
surfaces and SDF fields based on a single or a small set of images. FINS
integrates a multi-resolution hash grid encoder with lightweight geometry and
color heads, making the training via an approximate second-order optimizer
highly efficient and capable of converging within a few seconds. Additionally,
we achieve the construction of a neural surface requiring only a single RGB
image, by leveraging pre-trained foundation models to estimate the geometry
inherent in the image. Our experiments demonstrate that under the same
conditions, our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both
convergence speed and accuracy on surface reconstruction and SDF field
estimation. Moreover, we demonstrate the applicability of FINS for robot
surface following tasks and show its scalability to a variety of benchmark
datasets.

*Shouren Mao,Minghao Qin,Wei Dong,Huajian Liu,Yongzhuo Gao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RAM-NAS proposes a resource-aware multi-objective neural architecture search focusing on robotic hardware. It achieves high accuracy and reduced latency compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address limitations in conventional NAS methods that disregard robot hardware resource constraints and insufficient supernet pretraining processes.

Method: RAM-NAS integrates subnets mutual distillation using the sandwich rule and enhances distillation with DKD loss. Latency Surrogate predictors are employed for hardware inference latency estimation during the evolutionary search.

Result: RAM-NAS models achieve 76.7%-81.4% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet and reduced inference latency compared to MobileNetv3-based methods on robotic edge hardware.

Conclusion: The proposed method bridges the gap in NAS, emphasizing resource-aware optimization tailored to robotic hardware, offering scalability and improved performance on downstream tasks.

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) has shown great promise in automatically
designing lightweight models. However, conventional approaches are insufficient
in training the supernet and pay little attention to actual robot hardware
resources. To meet such challenges, we propose RAM-NAS, a resource-aware
multi-objective NAS method that focuses on improving the supernet pretrain and
resource-awareness on robot hardware devices. We introduce the concept of
subnets mutual distillation, which refers to mutually distilling all subnets
sampled by the sandwich rule. Additionally, we utilize the Decoupled Knowledge
Distillation (DKD) loss to enhance logits distillation performance. To expedite
the search process with consideration for hardware resources, we used data from
three types of robotic edge hardware to train Latency Surrogate predictors.
These predictors facilitated the estimation of hardware inference latency
during the search phase, enabling a unified multi-objective evolutionary search
to balance model accuracy and latency trade-offs. Our discovered model family,
RAM-NAS models, can achieve top-1 accuracy ranging from 76.7% to 81.4% on
ImageNet. In addition, the resource-aware multi-objective NAS we employ
significantly reduces the model's inference latency on edge hardware for
robots. We conducted experiments on downstream tasks to verify the scalability
of our methods. The inference time for detection and segmentation is reduced on
all three hardware types compared to MobileNetv3-based methods. Our work fills
the gap in NAS for robot hardware resource-aware.

*Chathura Semasinghe,Siavash Rezazadeh*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper develops a walking model incorporating ankle dynamics to improve gait stability and mimic human stabilization strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reduced-order walking models lack dynamics for ankles and feet, limiting their ability to accurately represent human gait and stabilization behaviors.

Method: By adapting a human-inspired paradigm for ankle dynamics, the model combines foot placement and proprioceptive ankle control strategies to enhance walking stability.

Result: The upgraded model stabilizes against large initial errors using foot placement and ankle strategies, and addresses small perturbations using solely ankle dynamics.

Conclusion: The model provides insights into anthropomorphic walking, particularly stabilization mechanisms observed in humans.

Abstract: This paper extends the forced-oscillation-based reduced-order model of
walking to a model with ankles and feet. A human-inspired paradigm was designed
for the ankle dynamics, which results in improved gait characteristics compared
to the point-foot model. In addition, it was shown that while the proposed
model can stabilize against large errors in initial conditions through
combination of foot placement and ankle strategies, the model is able to
stabilize against small perturbations without relying on the foot placement
control and solely through the designed proprioceptive ankle scheme. This novel
property, which is also observed in humans, can help in better understanding of
anthropomorphic walking and its stabilization mechanisms.

*Qingpeng Li,Chengrui Zhu,Yanming Wu,Xin Yuan,Zhen Zhang,Jian Yang,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces RuN, a framework allowing humanoid robots to achieve smooth and dynamic walking-to-running transitions efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable humanoid robots to perform natural, dynamic locomotion across diverse speeds, overcoming challenges in existing RL methods.

Method: Propose RuN, a decoupled residual learning framework using a Conditional Motion Generator for motion prior and reinforcement learning for dynamic corrections.

Result: RuN achieves stable and natural gaits with smooth transitions from walk to run, outperforming existing methods in efficiency and performance.

Conclusion: RuN effectively resolves locomotion challenges, offering a novel and high-performing solution for humanoid robots across varying speeds.

Abstract: Enabling humanoid robots to achieve natural and dynamic locomotion across a
wide range of speeds, including smooth transitions from walking to running,
presents a significant challenge. Existing deep reinforcement learning methods
typically require the policy to directly track a reference motion, forcing a
single policy to simultaneously learn motion imitation, velocity tracking, and
stability maintenance. To address this, we introduce RuN, a novel decoupled
residual learning framework. RuN decomposes the control task by pairing a
pre-trained Conditional Motion Generator, which provides a kinematically
natural motion prior, with a reinforcement learning policy that learns a
lightweight residual correction to handle dynamical interactions. Experiments
in simulation and reality on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot demonstrate that RuN
achieves stable, natural gaits and smooth walk-run transitions across a broad
velocity range (0-2.5 m/s), outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both
training efficiency and final performance.

### [335] [Joint Flow Trajectory Optimization For Feasible Robot Motion Generation from Video Demonstrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20703)
*Xiaoxiang Dong,Matthew Johnson-Roberson,Weiming Zhi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework called Joint Flow Trajectory Optimization (JFTO) to enable video-based Learning-from-Demonstration (LfD) for robot manipulators. It addresses challenges related to embodiment differences and joint feasibility constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide an alternative way for robot manipulators to learn from human demonstrations in video form, which is more scalable than teleoperation or kinesthetic teaching. This approach needs to address embodiment differences between humans and robots as well as feasibility and collision constraints.

Method: The JFTO framework focuses on object-centric demonstrations rather than direct replication of human motions. It uses a probabilistic model to represent multimodal object trajectories and balances grasp pose feasibility, trajectory imitation, and collision-free execution via a differentiable optimization framework.

Result: The proposed method was validated through simulation and real-world experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse real-world manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: The JFTO framework provides a robust solution for robot manipulators to imitate human demonstrations by focusing on object-centric trajectories and integrating probabilistic modeling into the optimization process, ensuring feasibility and collision avoidance.

Abstract: Learning from human video demonstrations offers a scalable alternative to
teleoperation or kinesthetic teaching, but poses challenges for robot
manipulators due to embodiment differences and joint feasibility constraints.
We address this problem by proposing the Joint Flow Trajectory Optimization
(JFTO) framework for grasp pose generation and object trajectory imitation
under the video-based Learning-from-Demonstration (LfD) paradigm. Rather than
directly imitating human hand motions, our method treats demonstrations as
object-centric guides, balancing three objectives: (i) selecting a feasible
grasp pose, (ii) generating object trajectories consistent with demonstrated
motions, and (iii) ensuring collision-free execution within robot kinematics.
To capture the multimodal nature of demonstrations, we extend flow matching to
$\SE(3)$ for probabilistic modeling of object trajectories, enabling
density-aware imitation that avoids mode collapse. The resulting optimization
integrates grasp similarity, trajectory likelihood, and collision penalties
into a unified differentiable objective. We validate our approach in both
simulation and real-world experiments across diverse real-world manipulation
tasks.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces BIM2RDT, an AI-based framework for transforming BIMs into robot-ready digital twins to enhance construction safety and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between static BIM data and real-time, dynamic construction site management, especially for safety and operational optimization.

Method: The framework combines BIM data, IoT sensor activity, and robot-collected visual-spatial data using the SG-ICP algorithm (leveraging LLM reasoning), YOLOE object detection, and real-time Hand-Arm Vibration (HAV) monitoring.

Result: Experiments show SG-ICP improves accuracy significantly (64.3%--88.3% RMSE reductions) compared to traditional algorithms, and HAV monitoring enhances safety compliance.

Conclusion: The BIM2RDT framework successfully integrates multiple technologies to create dynamic and safety-focused digital twins for autonomous construction site operations.

Abstract: The adoption of cyber-physical systems and jobsite intelligence that connects
design models, real-time site sensing, and autonomous field operations can
dramatically enhance digital management in the construction industry. This
paper introduces BIM2RDT (Building Information Models to Robot-Ready Site
Digital Twins), an agentic artificial intelligence (AI) framework designed to
transform static Building Information Modeling (BIM) into dynamic, robot-ready
digital twins (DTs) that prioritize safety during execution. The framework
bridges the gap between pre-existing BIM data and real-time site conditions by
integrating three key data streams: geometric and semantic information from BIM
models, activity data from IoT sensor networks, and visual-spatial data
collected by robots during site traversal. The methodology introduces
Semantic-Gravity ICP (SG-ICP), a point cloud registration algorithm that
leverages large language model (LLM) reasoning. Unlike traditional methods,
SG-ICP utilizes an LLM to infer object-specific, plausible orientation priors
based on BIM semantics, improving alignment accuracy by avoiding convergence on
local minima. This creates a feedback loop where robot-collected data updates
the DT, which in turn optimizes paths for missions. The framework employs YOLOE
object detection and Shi-Tomasi corner detection to identify and track
construction elements while using BIM geometry as a priori maps. The framework
also integrates real-time Hand-Arm Vibration (HAV) monitoring, mapping
sensor-detected safety events to the digital twin using IFC standards for
intervention. Experiments demonstrate SG-ICP's superiority over standard ICP,
achieving RMSE reductions of 64.3%--88.3% in alignment across scenarios with
occluded features, ensuring plausible orientations. HAV integration triggers
warnings upon exceeding exposure limits, enhancing compliance with ISO 5349-1.

*Mani Amani,Reza Akhavian*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for integrating natural language prompts with BIM-derived semantic maps for robotic mission planning, using a context-aware Beta-Bernoulli Bayesian fusion method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance robotic mission planning by incorporating human instructions through natural language prompts, specifically targeting the construction domain where Building Information Models offer rich data.

Method: The method involves treating a Large Language Model (LLM) as a sensor to infer context from natural language directives and combining this information with BIM-derived maps using Beta-Bernoulli Bayesian fusion.

Result: Simulation results show improved path robustness and validity, suggesting the approach enhances robots' ability to navigate construction sites safely and effectively.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully integrates NL directives with BIM data, providing a flexible and stable method to guide robots in construction environments, and is compatible with existing AI frameworks.

Abstract: Integrating natural language (NL) prompts into robotic mission planning has
attracted significant interest in recent years. In the construction domain,
Building Information Models (BIM) encapsulate rich NL descriptions of the
environment. We present a novel framework that fuses NL directives with
BIM-derived semantic maps via a Beta-Bernoulli Bayesian fusion by interpreting
the LLM as a sensor: each obstacle's design-time repulsive coefficient is
treated as a Beta(alpha, beta) random variable and LLM-returned danger scores
are incorporated as pseudo-counts to update alpha and beta. The resulting
posterior mean yields a continuous, context-aware repulsive gain that augments
a Euclidean-distance-based potential field for cost heuristics. By adjusting
gains based on sentiment and context inferred from user prompts, our method
guides robots along safer, more context-aware paths. This provides a
numerically stable method that can chain multiple natural commands and prompts
from construction workers and foreman to enable planning while giving
flexibility to be integrated in any learned or classical AI framework.
Simulation results demonstrate that this Beta-Bernoulli fusion yields both
qualitative and quantitative improvements in path robustness and validity.

*Zhenguo Sun,Yibo Peng,Yuan Meng,Xukun Li,Bo-Sheng Huang,Zhenshan Bing,Xinlong Wang,Alois Knoll*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RobotDancing introduces a framework for motion tracking on humanoid robots by predicting residual joint targets to handle dynamic discrepancies, resulting in robust, zero-shot sim-to-real deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motion tracking over long durations and high dynamics on humanoid robots is challenging due to errors from model-plant mismatches using absolute joint commands.

Method: RobotDancing employs an end-to-end reinforcement learning pipeline to predict residual joint targets, utilizing a unified observation, reward, and hyperparameter setup.

Result: The framework successfully tracks multi-minute, high-energy motions like jumps and spins on Unitree G1 robots and demonstrates effective zero-shot sim-to-real deployment.

Conclusion: RobotDancing enhances motion tracking reliability and scalability for humanoid robots, enabling accurate performance without prior real-world adaptation.

Abstract: Long-horizon, high-dynamic motion tracking on humanoids remains brittle
because absolute joint commands cannot compensate model-plant mismatch, leading
to error accumulation. We propose RobotDancing, a simple, scalable framework
that predicts residual joint targets to explicitly correct dynamics
discrepancies. The pipeline is end-to-end--training, sim-to-sim validation, and
zero-shot sim-to-real--and uses a single-stage reinforcement learning (RL)
setup with a unified observation, reward, and hyperparameter configuration. We
evaluate primarily on Unitree G1 with retargeted LAFAN1 dance sequences and
validate transfer on H1/H1-2. RobotDancing can track multi-minute, high-energy
behaviors (jumps, spins, cartwheels) and deploys zero-shot to hardware with
high motion tracking quality.

*Guoyang Zhao,Yudong Li,Weiqing Qi,Kai Zhang,Bonan Liu,Kai Chen,Haoang Li,Jun Ma*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a SLAM-free navigation framework for legged robots, focusing on semantic reasoning and lightweight topological maps using vision-language fusion, achieving improved navigation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SLAM pipelines for legged robots face challenges like fragility during rapid motions, high calibration demands, and sensor drift, along with limited semantic capabilities for task-oriented exploration.

Method: The proposed framework uses hierarchical vision-language perception to infer semantic contexts and object cues. It employs a semantic-probabilistic topological map for high-level subgoal selection via an LLM and low-level vision-based obstacle avoidance.

Result: Experiments in both simulations and real-world environments showed enhanced semantic accuracy, better planning, and higher navigation success. Ablation studies confirmed the importance of hierarchical perception and local planning.

Conclusion: The work presents a new SLAM-free navigation paradigm, emphasizing semantics over traditional geometry-centric mapping for more efficient robot exploration and decision-making.

Abstract: Conventional SLAM pipelines for legged robot navigation are fragile under
rapid motion, calibration demands, and sensor drift, while offering limited
semantic reasoning for task-driven exploration. To deal with these issues, we
propose a vision-only, SLAM-free navigation framework that replaces dense
geometry with semantic reasoning and lightweight topological representations. A
hierarchical vision-language perception module fuses scene-level context with
object-level cues for robust semantic inference. And a semantic-probabilistic
topological map supports coarse-to-fine planning: LLM-based global reasoning
for subgoal selection and vision-based local planning for obstacle avoidance.
Integrated with reinforcement-learning locomotion controllers, the framework is
deployable across diverse legged robot platforms. Experiments in simulation and
real-world settings demonstrate consistent improvements in semantic accuracy,
planning quality, and navigation success, while ablation studies further
showcase the necessity of both hierarchical perception and fine local planning.
This work introduces a new paradigm for SLAM-free, vision-language-driven
navigation, shifting robotic exploration from geometry-centric mapping to
semantics-driven decision making.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MASt3R-Fusion, a visual SLAM framework integrating neural network-based pointmap regression with sensor data to enhance mapping and tracking performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in classical visual SLAM systems, such as low-texture environments and scale ambiguity, by integrating probabilistic multi-sensor information fusion.

Method: MASt3R-Fusion employs feed-forward pointmap regression along with inertial and GNSS sensor data within a Sim(3)-based visual alignment and metric-scale SE(3) factor graph.

Result: The proposed SLAM system showed significant improvements in accuracy and robustness in benchmarking and self-collected datasets.

Conclusion: By combining neural network regression with multi-sensor data and hierarchical factor graph design, MASt3R-Fusion advances real-time pose tracking and globally consistent mapping, contributing to the field with open-source support for reproducibility.

Abstract: Visual SLAM is a cornerstone technique in robotics, autonomous driving and
extended reality (XR), yet classical systems often struggle with low-texture
environments, scale ambiguity, and degraded performance under challenging
visual conditions. Recent advancements in feed-forward neural network-based
pointmap regression have demonstrated the potential to recover high-fidelity 3D
scene geometry directly from images, leveraging learned spatial priors to
overcome limitations of traditional multi-view geometry methods. However, the
widely validated advantages of probabilistic multi-sensor information fusion
are often discarded in these pipelines. In this work, we propose
MASt3R-Fusion,a multi-sensor-assisted visual SLAM framework that tightly
integrates feed-forward pointmap regression with complementary sensor
information, including inertial measurements and GNSS data. The system
introduces Sim(3)-based visualalignment constraints (in the Hessian form) into
a universal metric-scale SE(3) factor graph for effective information fusion. A
hierarchical factor graph design is developed, which allows both real-time
sliding-window optimization and global optimization with aggressive loop
closures, enabling real-time pose tracking, metric-scale structure perception
and globally consistent mapping. We evaluate our approach on both public
benchmarks and self-collected datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements
in accuracy and robustness over existing visual-centered multi-sensor SLAM
systems. The code will be released open-source to support reproducibility and
further research (https://github.com/GREAT-WHU/MASt3R-Fusion).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of applying multi-task reinforcement learning to robotics, particularly the high cost of collecting diverse task data.

Method: Proposes MT-Lévy, which combines policy sharing across tasks and temporally extended exploration inspired by Lévy flights, while dynamically adjusting exploration levels based on task success ratios.

Result: Experimental results show improved exploration, sample efficiency, and state-space coverage in robotics tasks, supported by quantitative analyses and ablation studies.

Conclusion: MT-Lévy demonstrates the viability of improving multi-task reinforcement learning in robotics by integrating adaptive exploration strategies with behavior sharing.

Abstract: Multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL) offers a promising approach to
improve sample efficiency and generalization by training agents across multiple
tasks, enabling knowledge sharing between them. However, applying MTRL to
robotics remains challenging due to the high cost of collecting diverse task
data. To address this, we propose MT-L\'evy, a novel exploration strategy that
enhances sample efficiency in MTRL environments by combining behavior sharing
across tasks with temporally extended exploration inspired by L\'evy flight.
MT-L\'evy leverages policies trained on related tasks to guide exploration
towards key states, while dynamically adjusting exploration levels based on
task success ratios. This approach enables more efficient state-space coverage,
even in complex robotics environments. Empirical results demonstrate that
MT-L\'evy significantly improves exploration and sample efficiency, supported
by quantitative and qualitative analyses. Ablation studies further highlight
the contribution of each component, showing that combining behavior sharing
with adaptive exploration strategies can significantly improve the practicality
of MTRL in robotics applications.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces SemSight, a model for predicting room-level semantic structures in unseen areas during navigation, aimed at improving navigation efficiency and understanding of environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for navigation and exploration predictions are limited to single object or geometric occupancy maps and lack the ability to model room-level semantics, motivated the authors to propose a model addressing this gap.

Method: The authors developed SemSight, a probabilistic model using semantic maps, encoder-decoder architecture, and a mask-constrained supervision strategy to predict scene semantics based on observations. The training involved a large dataset generated from simulated exploration of indoor layouts.

Result: SemSight improves the prediction of functional category semantics and achieves better performance compared to non-mask-supervised methods in metrics like Structural Consistency and Region Recognition Accuracy. It also reduces search steps for robots in simulations.

Conclusion: The proposed SemSight method advances the field of target-driven navigation by enabling accurate room-level semantic prediction, which results in improved navigation efficiency and enhanced environment understanding.

Abstract: In target-driven navigation and autonomous exploration, reasonable prediction
of unknown regions is crucial for efficient navigation and environment
understanding. Existing methods mostly focus on single objects or geometric
occupancy maps, lacking the ability to model room-level semantic structures. We
propose SemSight, a probabilistic bird's-eye-view prediction model for
multi-level scene semantics. The model jointly infers structural layouts,
global scene context, and target area distributions, completing semantic maps
of unexplored areas while estimating probability maps for target categories. To
train SemSight, we simulate frontier-driven exploration on 2,000 indoor layout
graphs, constructing a diverse dataset of 40,000 sequential egocentric
observations paired with complete semantic maps. We adopt an encoder-decoder
network as the core architecture and introduce a mask-constrained supervision
strategy. This strategy applies a binary mask of unexplored areas so that
supervision focuses only on unknown regions, forcing the model to infer
semantic structures from the observed context. Experimental results show that
SemSight improves prediction performance for key functional categories in
unexplored regions and outperforms non-mask-supervised approaches on metrics
such as Structural Consistency (SC) and Region Recognition Accuracy (PA). It
also enhances navigation efficiency in closed-loop simulations, reducing the
number of search steps when guiding robots toward target areas.

TL;DR: The paper proposes CoMOK, a novel end-to-end action representation for robotic manipulation, proving its effectiveness through experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current end-to-end robotic manipulation approaches face limitations with generalizability, accuracy, and reliability, prompting the need for improvements.

Method: The authors introduced the Chain of Moving Oriented Keypoints (CoMOK) as an action representation in a neural policy, extending traditional end-effector pose representation.

Result: CoMOK demonstrates general applicability across tasks, sub-centimeter accuracy, and effective handling of complex scenarios, verified through simulations and hardware experiments.

Conclusion: CoMOK establishes itself as a promising approach for accurate, reliable, and generalized end-to-end robotic manipulation.

Abstract: End-to-end robot manipulation policies offer significant potential for
enabling embodied agents to understand and interact with the world. Unlike
traditional modular pipelines, end-to-end learning mitigates key limitations
such as information loss between modules and feature misalignment caused by
isolated optimization targets. Despite these advantages, existing end-to-end
neural networks for robotic manipulation--including those based on large
VLM/VLA models--remain insufficiently performant for large-scale practical
deployment. In this paper, we take a step towards an end-to-end manipulation
policy that is generalizable, accurate and reliable. To achieve this goal, we
propose a novel Chain of Moving Oriented Keypoints (CoMOK) formulation for
robotic manipulation. Our formulation is used as the action representation of a
neural policy, which can be trained in an end-to-end fashion. Such an action
representation is general, as it extends the standard end-effector pose action
representation and supports a diverse set of manipulation tasks in a unified
manner. The oriented keypoint in our method enables natural generalization to
objects with different shapes and sizes, while achieving sub-centimeter
accuracy. Moreover, our formulation can easily handle multi-stage tasks,
multi-modal robot behaviors, and deformable objects. Extensive simulated and
hardware experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fragility of existing vision-language models in autonomous driving, especially their hallucinations and weak generalization in out-of-distribution scenarios.

Method: The proposed MTRDrive framework combines a memory-based experience retrieval mechanism with dynamic toolkits in a closed-loop system to enhance reasoning and decision-making capabilities.

Result: MTRDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance on the NAVSIM benchmark with notable scores in high-level planning and showcases strong zero-shot generalization on the Roadwork-VLM benchmark in unseen scenarios.

Conclusion: MTRDrive demonstrates significant improvements in reasoning, decision-making, and robustness, marking a step forward in making autonomous driving systems safer and more reliable.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models(VLMs) have demonstrated significant potential for
end-to-end autonomous driving, yet a substantial gap remains between their
current capabilities and the reliability necessary for real-world deployment. A
critical challenge is their fragility, characterized by hallucinations and poor
generalization in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. To bridge this gap, we
introduce MTRDrive, a novel framework that integrates procedural driving
experiences with a dynamic toolkit to enhance generalization and proactive
decision-making.
  MTRDrive addresses these limitations through a closed-loop system that
combines a memory-based experience retrieval mechanism with dynamic toolkits.
This synergy enables the model to interact more effectively with its
environment, improving both reasoning and decision-making capabilities with the
help of our memory-tool synergistic reasoning. Additionally, we introduce a new
benchmark based on complex Roadwork construction scenarios to rigorously

*Xiaohan Ye,Kui Wu,Zherong Pan,Taku Komura*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper addresses issues with erratic gradient behavior in differentiable physics due to contact model designs, introducing a practical model to improve gradient stability and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Differentiable simulators are crucial for tasks like model predictive control and robotic design optimization, but their gradient instability affects optimizer convergence, highlighting the need for better contact models.

Method: The authors define essential properties for contact models ensuring stable gradient behavior and propose a computationally efficient model satisfying these criteria.

Result: Experiments confirm that the proposed contact model discovers complex control signals from simple initializations, enabling successful execution of various locomotion and manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: Using a well-designed contact model ensures stable gradients in differentiable rigid-body simulators, improving downstream task performance while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: With the maturation of differentiable physics, its role in various downstream
applications: such as model predictive control, robotic design optimization,
and neural PDE solvers, has become increasingly important. However, the
derivative information provided by differentiable simulators can exhibit abrupt
changes or vanish altogether, impeding the convergence of gradient-based
optimizers. In this work, we demonstrate that such erratic gradient behavior is
closely tied to the design of contact models. We further introduce a set of
properties that a contact model must satisfy to ensure well-behaved gradient
information. Lastly, we present a practical contact model for differentiable
rigid-body simulators that satisfies all of these properties while maintaining
computational efficiency. Our experiments show that, even from simple
initializations, our contact model can discover complex, contact-rich control
signals, enabling the successful execution of a range of downstream locomotion
and manipulation tasks.

*Jianbo Zhao,Taiyu Ban,Xiangjie Li,Xingtai Gui,Hangning Zhou,Lei Liu,Hongwei Zhao,Bin Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper addresses limitations in autoregressive models for autonomous driving by introducing a Time-Invariant Spatial Alignment (TISA) module and enhancing training using Direct Preference Optimization, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the performance bottleneck in end-to-end autonomous driving caused by spatio-temporal misalignment in autoregressive models.

Method: Introduce TISA for consistent ego-centric spatial alignment, add a kinematic action prediction head for trajectory feasibility, and enhance training with Direct Preference Optimization for improved driving behavior feedback.

Result: The proposed approach achieves a state-of-the-art 89.8 PDMS on the NAVSIM dataset among autoregressive models, demonstrating significant improvements.

Conclusion: Correcting the spatial misalignment and incorporating enhanced feedback mechanisms substantially boosts the performance of autoregressive models for planning in autonomous driving.

Abstract: The inherent sequential modeling capabilities of autoregressive models make
them a formidable baseline for end-to-end planning in autonomous driving.
Nevertheless, their performance is constrained by a spatio-temporal
misalignment, as the planner must condition future actions on past sensory
data. This creates an inconsistent worldview, limiting the upper bound of
performance for an otherwise powerful approach. To address this, we propose a
Time-Invariant Spatial Alignment (TISA) module that learns to project initial
environmental features into a consistent ego-centric frame for each future time
step, effectively correcting the agent's worldview without explicit future
scene prediction. In addition, we employ a kinematic action prediction head
(i.e., acceleration and yaw rate) to ensure physically feasible trajectories.
Finally, we introduce a multi-objective post-training stage using Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) to move beyond pure imitation. Our approach
provides targeted feedback on specific driving behaviors, offering a more
fine-grained learning signal than the single, overall objective used in
standard DPO. Our model achieves a state-of-the-art 89.8 PDMS on the NAVSIM
dataset among autoregressive models. The video document is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve natural language-guided pick-and-place tasks in unpredictable, unseen indoor environments with a focus on creating a system that can operate in real-time on embedded hardware.

Method: The framework parses natural language input into a structured task graph, integrating SLAM, semantic mapping, task-aware exploration, and an approach planner. Manipulation is refined using a fine-tuned SmolVLA manipulation head, and the system operates fully onboard with consumer-level hardware.

Result: The system achieves a 46% overall task success rate in a multi-room lab with static scenes and typical human motion, demonstrating real-time operation on embedded compute.

Conclusion: AnywhereVLA effectively blends classical geometry-based navigation and language-conditioned manipulation for reliable and agile mobile manipulation in indoor settings.

Abstract: We address natural language pick-and-place in unseen, unpredictable indoor
environments with AnywhereVLA, a modular framework for mobile manipulation. A
user text prompt serves as an entry point and is parsed into a structured task
graph that conditions classical SLAM with LiDAR and cameras, metric semantic
mapping, and a task-aware frontier exploration policy. An approach planner then
selects visibility and reachability aware pre grasp base poses. For
interaction, a compact SmolVLA manipulation head is fine tuned on platform pick
and place trajectories for the SO-101 by TheRobotStudio, grounding local visual
context and sub-goals into grasp and place proposals. The full system runs
fully onboard on consumer-level hardware, with Jetson Orin NX for perception
and VLA and an Intel NUC for SLAM, exploration, and control, sustaining
real-time operation. We evaluated AnywhereVLA in a multi-room lab under static
scenes and normal human motion. In this setting, the system achieves a $46\%$
overall task success rate while maintaining throughput on embedded compute. By
combining a classical stack with a fine-tuned VLA manipulation, the system
inherits the reliability of geometry-based navigation with the agility and task
generalization of language-conditioned manipulation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-robot task-and-motion planning framework for precise and safe electric vehicle battery disassembly, achieving significant gains in efficiency and collision safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this paper is to address the challenges in EV battery disassembly, which demands accurate multi-robot coordination, robust collision safety, and reliable navigation in cluttered and dynamic environments.

Method: The paper proposes a four-layer TAMP (task-and-motion planning) framework that integrates symbolic task planning and accessibility-aware robot allocation with a TP-GMM-guided motion planner trained on demonstrations. It includes stereo vision with YOLOv8 for real-time component localization, OctoMap-based 3D mapping, and Flexible Collision Library checks for collision avoidance.

Result: The system was validated on two UR10e robots in various EV battery disassembly tasks, showing improvements over a baseline: a 63.3% reduction in end-effector path length, 8.1% shortened makespan, smaller swept volumes per arm, and a 47% decrease in mutual overlap.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances autonomy, safety, and precision for multi-robot coordination in EV battery disassembly, making it suitable for unstructured and dynamic environments.

Abstract: Electric-vehicle (EV) battery disassembly requires precise multi-robot
coordination, short and reliable motions, and robust collision safety in
cluttered, dynamic scenes. We propose a four-layer task-and-motion planning
(TAMP) framework that couples symbolic task planning and cost- and
accessibility-aware allocation with a TP-GMM-guided motion planner learned from
demonstrations. Stereo vision with YOLOv8 provides real-time component
localization, while OctoMap-based 3D mapping and FCL(Flexible Collision
Library) checks in MoveIt unify predictive digital-twin collision checking with
reactive, vision-based avoidance. Validated on two UR10e robots across cable,
busbar, service plug, and three leaf-cell removals, the approach yields
substantially more compact and safer motions than a default RRTConnect baseline
under identical perception and task assignments: average end-effector path
length drops by $-63.3\%$ and makespan by $-8.1\%$; per-arm swept volumes
shrink (R1: $0.583\rightarrow0.139\,\mathrm{m}^3$; R2:
$0.696\rightarrow0.252\,\mathrm{m}^3$), and mutual overlap decreases by $47\%$
($0.064\rightarrow0.034\,\mathrm{m}^3$). These results highlight improved
autonomy, precision, and safety for multi-robot EV battery disassembly in
unstructured, dynamic environments.

*Sibo Li,Qianyue Hao,Yu Shang,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: KeyWorld reduces computational redundancy in robotic world models by focusing on key frames and using efficient interpolation for intermediate states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robotic world models face inefficiencies due to redundant frame-to-frame computations and limited attention to semantically crucial transitions, restricting real-world usability.

Method: KeyWorld uses a framework where significant key frames are identified to capture critical transitions, a DiT model generates key frames using text descriptions, and lightweight interpolation fills intermediate frames.

Result: KeyWorld achieves a 5.68× speedup compared to traditional frame-to-frame methods while improving physical plausibility in tasks, particularly those with complex motions.

Conclusion: KeyWorld offers an efficient and effective solution for real-time robotic world modeling, with potential extensions to other domains. The code is made openly available for broader exploration.

Abstract: Robotic world models are a promising paradigm for forecasting future
environment states, yet their inference speed and the physical plausibility of
generated trajectories remain critical bottlenecks, limiting their real-world
applications. This stems from the redundancy of the prevailing frame-to-frame
generation approach, where the model conducts costly computation on similar
frames, as well as neglecting the semantic importance of key transitions. To
address this inefficiency, we propose KeyWorld, a framework that improves
text-conditioned robotic world models by concentrating transformers computation
on a few semantic key frames while employing a lightweight convolutional model
to fill the intermediate frames. Specifically, KeyWorld first identifies
significant transitions by iteratively simplifying the robot's motion
trajectories, obtaining the ground truth key frames. Then, a DiT model is
trained to reason and generate these physically meaningful key frames from
textual task descriptions. Finally, a lightweight interpolator efficiently
reconstructs the full video by inpainting all intermediate frames. Evaluations
on the LIBERO benchmark demonstrate that KeyWorld achieves a 5.68$\times$
acceleration compared to the frame-to-frame generation baseline, and focusing
on the motion-aware key frames further contributes to the physical validity of
the generated videos, especially on complex tasks. Our approach highlights a
practical path toward deploying world models in real-time robotic control and
other domains requiring both efficient and effective world models. Code is

Conclusion: The study enhances the feasibility of satellite docking for on-orbit refueling and servicing, addressing fuel efficiency and disturbance resilience.

Abstract: This paper presents an integrated Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Model
Predictive Control (MPC) framework for autonomous satellite docking with a
partially filled fuel tank. Traditional docking control faces challenges due to
fuel sloshing in microgravity, which induces unpredictable forces affecting
stability. To address this, we integrate Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and
Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) RL algorithms with MPC, leveraging MPC's predictive
capabilities to accelerate RL training and improve control robustness. The
proposed approach is validated through Zero-G Lab of SnT experiments for planar
stabilization and high-fidelity numerical simulations for 6-DOF docking with
fuel sloshing dynamics. Simulation results demonstrate that SAC-MPC achieves
superior docking accuracy, higher success rates, and lower control effort,
outperforming standalone RL and PPO-MPC methods. This study advances
fuel-efficient and disturbance-resilient satellite docking, enhancing the
feasibility of on-orbit refueling and servicing missions.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces Normalizing Flows Policy for visuomotor tasks, highlighting its advantages over diffusion models, such as faster inference and confidence estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for probabilistic models in robotics that balance computational efficiency and the ability to quantify uncertainty, which are crucial for trustworthiness in robotics.

Method: Proposes the use of Normalizing Flows as a visuomotor policy learning model, emphasizing its efficiency and its ability to measure confidence statistically.

Result: The Normalizing Flows Policy outperforms or matches Diffusion Policy in four robotic tasks, with greater sample efficiency and up to 30x faster inference.

Conclusion: Normalizing Flows are a robust alternative to diffusion models in robotics, combining performance, efficiency, and statistical confidence estimation.

Abstract: The field of general purpose robotics has recently embraced powerful
probabilistic models, such as diffusion models, to model and learn complex
behaviors. However, these models often come with significant trade-offs, namely
high computational costs for inference and a fundamental inability to quantify
output uncertainty. We argue that a model's trustworthiness, a critical factor
for reliable, general-purpose robotics, is inherently linked to its ability to
provide confidence measures.
  In this work, we introduce Normalizing Flows Policy, a novel visuomotor
policy learning model based on Normalizing Flows. We show that Normalizing
Flows are a natural and powerful alternative to diffusion models, providing
both a statistically sound measure of confidence and a highly efficient
inference process. Through comprehensive experiments across four distinct
simulated robotic tasks, we demonstrate that Normalizing Flows Policy achieves
performance comparable to, and often surpassing, Diffusion Policy, and it does
so not only with improved sample efficiency but also with up to 30 times faster
inference. Additionally, our ablation study validates several key architectural
and training techniques that enable Normalizing Flows to perform well in this
domain.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high deployment costs and computational demands of current edge detection methods in drones, which rely on radars or cameras, and to enable low-cost, efficient solutions for disaster relief and autonomous navigation.

Method: The key idea is to analyze drone attitude sensor readings and flight commands to detect changes in the ground effect, which signal boundaries of materials. This approach includes theoretical analysis, algorithm design, and implementation.

Result: The system achieves a mean detection distance error of 0.051m, outperforming baseline methods by 86%, and functions with only 43 mW of power consumption.

Conclusion: AirTouch offers a novel, low-cost, and resource-efficient method for accurate edge detection in drones, leveraging ground effect without compromising flight stability.

Abstract: Drone-based rapid and accurate environmental edge detection is highly
advantageous for tasks such as disaster relief and autonomous navigation.
Current methods, using radars or cameras, raise deployment costs and burden
lightweight drones with high computational demands. In this paper, we propose
AirTouch, a system that transforms the ground effect from a stability "foe" in
traditional flight control views, into a "friend" for accurate and efficient
edge detection. Our key insight is that analyzing drone basic attitude sensor
readings and flight commands allows us to detect ground effect changes. Such
changes typically indicate the drone flying over a boundary of two materials,
making this information valuable for edge detection. We approach this insight
through theoretical analysis, algorithm design, and implementation, fully
leveraging the ground effect as a new sensing modality without compromising
drone flight stability, thereby achieving accurate and efficient scene edge
detection. We also compare this new sensing modality with vision-based methods
to clarify its exclusive advantages in resource efficiency and detection
capability. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our system achieves a high
detection accuracy with mean detection distance errors of 0.051m, outperforming
the baseline method performance by 86%. With such detection performance, our
system requires only 43 mW power consumption, contributing to this new sensing
modality for low-cost and highly efficient edge detection.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CrossInstruct, a framework for teaching robots using cross-modal instructions (free-form annotations) instead of physical demonstrations, integrating vision-language models and reinforcement learning to achieve generalizable robot behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods of teaching robots—teleoperation or physically guiding them—are cumbersome and limit scalability. Researchers aim to simplify and scale robot behavior learning by exploring alternative paradigms.

Method: The paper proposes using rough annotations (e.g., text labels) integrated into a vision-language model (VLM) to synthesize motion. Outputs guide reinforcement learning policies to refine robot actions.

Result: CrossInstruct achieves effective and generalizable robot behaviors, validated via benchmark simulation tasks and real hardware, without requiring additional fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the viability of cross-modal instruction for scalable robot learning, offering robust behavior initialization and better efficiency in reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Teaching robots novel behaviors typically requires motion demonstrations via
teleoperation or kinaesthetic teaching, that is, physically guiding the robot.
While recent work has explored using human sketches to specify desired
behaviors, data collection remains cumbersome, and demonstration datasets are
difficult to scale. In this paper, we introduce an alternative paradigm,
Learning from Cross-Modal Instructions, where robots are shaped by
demonstrations in the form of rough annotations, which can contain free-form
text labels, and are used in lieu of physical motion. We introduce the
CrossInstruct framework, which integrates cross-modal instructions as examples
into the context input to a foundational vision-language model (VLM). The VLM
then iteratively queries a smaller, fine-tuned model, and synthesizes the
desired motion over multiple 2D views. These are then subsequently fused into a
coherent distribution over 3D motion trajectories in the robot's workspace. By
incorporating the reasoning of the large VLM with a fine-grained pointing
model, CrossInstruct produces executable robot behaviors that generalize beyond
the environment of in the limited set of instruction examples. We then
introduce a downstream reinforcement learning pipeline that leverages
CrossInstruct outputs to efficiently learn policies to complete fine-grained
tasks. We rigorously evaluate CrossInstruct on benchmark simulation tasks and
real hardware, demonstrating effectiveness without additional fine-tuning and
providing a strong initialization for policies subsequently refined via
reinforcement learning.

Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of balancing a ball on a movable beam with a drone's cable interaction, exploring effective control mechanisms.

Method: The authors propose a hierarchical control framework separating high-level balancing via reinforcement learning from low-level drone control.

Result: Simulation results reveal that the RL policy surpasses PID controllers due to its superior utilization of richer state observations, not merely better tuning or nonlinearity.

Conclusion: Comprehensive state representation plays a vital role in learning-based systems, and enhanced sensing capabilities could further advance controller performance.

Abstract: This paper addresses a drone ball-balancing task, in which a drone stabilizes
a ball atop a movable beam through cable-based interaction. We propose a
hierarchical control framework that decouples high-level balancing policy from
low-level drone control, and train a reinforcement learning (RL) policy to
handle the high-level decision-making. Simulation results show that the RL
policy achieves superior performance compared to carefully tuned PID
controllers within the same hierarchical structure. Through systematic
comparative analysis, we demonstrate that RL's advantage stems not from
improved parameter tuning or inherent nonlinear mapping capabilities, but from
its ability to effectively utilize richer state observations. These findings
underscore the critical role of comprehensive state representation in
learning-based systems and suggest that enhanced sensing could be instrumental
in improving controller performance.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Automotive-ENV, a novel benchmark for evaluating multimodal agents in automotive GUI scenarios and proposes ASURADA, a geo-aware agent improving interactions with safety-focused tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal agents excel in general GUI contexts but have limited exploration in the automotive domain, which has unique challenges like safety requirements and attention constraints.

Method: The authors created Automotive-ENV, a comprehensive benchmark defining 185 tasks for evaluating in-vehicle GUI interactions. They then developed ASURADA, a multimodal agent integrating GPS-based geo-awareness to adapt actions dynamically.

Result: Experiments show that incorporating geo-aware GPS context improves performance in safety-related tasks, emphasizing the critical role of location-based information for in-vehicle agents.

Conclusion: The study establishes Automotive-ENV as a key resource for advancing safe and location-aware multimodal agents in automotive systems, supporting further research and development.

Abstract: Multimodal agents have demonstrated strong performance in general GUI
interactions, but their application in automotive systems has been largely
unexplored. In-vehicle GUIs present distinct challenges: drivers' limited
attention, strict safety requirements, and complex location-based interaction
patterns. To address these challenges, we introduce Automotive-ENV, the first
high-fidelity benchmark and interaction environment tailored for vehicle GUIs.
This platform defines 185 parameterized tasks spanning explicit control,
implicit intent understanding, and safety-aware tasks, and provides structured
multimodal observations with precise programmatic checks for reproducible
evaluation. Building on this benchmark, we propose ASURADA, a geo-aware
multimodal agent that integrates GPS-informed context to dynamically adjust
actions based on location, environmental conditions, and regional driving
norms. Experiments show that geo-aware information significantly improves
success on safety-aware tasks, highlighting the importance of location-based
context in automotive environments. We will release Automotive-ENV, complete
with all tasks and benchmarking tools, to further the development of safe and
adaptive in-vehicle agents.

TL;DR: The paper presents DAGDiff, a framework improving dual-arm grasping by leveraging classifier-guided denoising in SE(3) x SE(3) space for better stability and collision handling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dual-arm grasping is pivotal for manipulating large, complex objects but struggles with stability, collision, and generalization, which prior methods address through heuristics or priors lacking guarantees.

Method: The work introduces DAGDiff, which employs classifier-guided denoising in SE(3) x SE(3) space, integrating geometry-, stability-, and collision-aware guidance to ensure physically valid and compliant grasps.

Result: DAGDiff outperforms prior methods in stability, collision avoidance, and physics-based simulations, as validated through analytical checks and empirical tests on real-world point clouds.

Conclusion: DAGDiff successfully generates stable dual-arm grasps for unseen objects, demonstrating its effectiveness on real-world setups with heterogeneous dual-arm manipulators.

Abstract: Reliable dual-arm grasping is essential for manipulating large and complex
objects but remains a challenging problem due to stability, collision, and
generalization requirements. Prior methods typically decompose the task into
two independent grasp proposals, relying on region priors or heuristics that
limit generalization and provide no principled guarantee of stability. We
propose DAGDiff, an end-to-end framework that directly denoises to grasp pairs
in the SE(3) x SE(3) space. Our key insight is that stability and collision can
be enforced more effectively by guiding the diffusion process with classifier
signals, rather than relying on explicit region detection or object priors. To
this end, DAGDiff integrates geometry-, stability-, and collision-aware
guidance terms that steer the generative process toward grasps that are
physically valid and force-closure compliant. We comprehensively evaluate
DAGDiff through analytical force-closure checks, collision analysis, and
large-scale physics-based simulations, showing consistent improvements over
previous work on these metrics. Finally, we demonstrate that our framework
generates dual-arm grasps directly on real-world point clouds of previously
unseen objects, which are executed on a heterogeneous dual-arm setup where two
manipulators reliably grasp and lift them.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots currently struggle to navigate efficiently in large, complex environments due to their inability to perform human-like behaviors such as using environmental cues or seeking assistance.

Method: The authors propose ReasonNav, a modular navigation system that utilizes a vision-language model and compact abstractions focused on language reasoning and navigation landmarks.

Result: The evaluation of ReasonNav on real and simulated navigation tasks demonstrated its ability to incorporate higher-order reasoning and navigate large, complex buildings effectively.

Conclusion: ReasonNav enables robots to adopt human-like behaviors for efficient navigation, showing promise for improving robotic performance in complex environments.

Abstract: When navigating in a man-made environment they haven't visited before--like
an office building--humans employ behaviors such as reading signs and asking
others for directions. These behaviors help humans reach their destinations
efficiently by reducing the need to search through large areas. Existing robot
navigation systems lack the ability to execute such behaviors and are thus
highly inefficient at navigating within large environments. We present
ReasonNav, a modular navigation system which integrates these human-like
navigation skills by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of a vision-language
model (VLM). We design compact input and output abstractions based on
navigation landmarks, allowing the VLM to focus on language understanding and
reasoning. We evaluate ReasonNav on real and simulated navigation tasks and
show that the agent successfully employs higher-order reasoning to navigate
efficiently in large, complex buildings.

Motivation: Conventional multi-rotors are under-actuated and cannot separately control attitude and position, limiting their functionality.

Method: The study introduces new configurations of multi-rotors with adjustable propeller axes, simulates them using Simscape Multibody, designs two customized controllers (sliding mode and PID-based with gravity compensation), and implements a power-efficient control allocation strategy.

Result: Proposed configurations and controllers are analyzed via simulations, considering power consumption and robustness against disturbances. They excel in efficiency and resilience.

Conclusion: The research delivers a framework for designing omniorientational drones, helping researchers choose optimal configurations and controllers based on specific goals.

Abstract: Conventional multi-rotors are under-actuated systems, hindering them from
independently controlling attitude from position. In this study, we present
several distinct configurations that incorporate additional control inputs for
manipulating the angles of the propeller axes. This addresses the mentioned
limitations, making the systems "omniorientational". We comprehensively derived

a sliding mode controller for robust handling of disturbances and a novel
PID-based controller with gravity compensation integrating linear and
non-linear allocators, designed for computational efficiency. A custom control
allocation strategy is implemented to manage the input-non-affine nature of
these systems, seeking to maximize battery life by minimizing the "Power
Consumption Factor" defined in this study. Moreover, the controllers
effectively managed harsh disturbances and uncertainties. Simulations compare
and analyze the proposed configurations and controllers, majorly considering
their power consumption. Furthermore, we conduct a qualitative comparison to
evaluate the impact of different types of uncertainties on the control system,
highlighting areas for potential model or hardware improvements. The analysis
in this study provides a roadmap for future researchers to design
omniorientational drones based on their design objectives, offering practical
insights into configuration selection and controller design. This research
aligns with the project SAC-1, one of the objectives of Sharif AgRoLab.

### [360] [SEEC: Stable End-Effector Control with Model-Enhanced Residual Learning for Humanoid Loco-Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21231)
*Jaehwi Jang,Zhuoheng Wang,Ziyi Zhou,Feiyang Wu,Ye Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel control framework that enhances end-effector stabilization for humanoid robots by combining model-based and learning-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current end-effector stabilization methods, which either suffer from inaccurate dynamics modeling or fail to generalize well to unseen scenarios.

Method: Introduces a stable end-effector control (SEEC) framework leveraging model-enhanced reinforcement learning and perturbation generators to ensure precise and adaptive movements.

Result: The proposed method outperformed baseline approaches and successfully adapted to new locomotion controllers in both simulations and real robot experiments.

Conclusion: The SEEC framework provides an effective and robust solution for end-effector stabilization in humanoid robots, bridging the gap between model-based precision and learning-based adaptability.

Abstract: Arm end-effector stabilization is essential for humanoid loco-manipulation
tasks, yet it remains challenging due to the high degrees of freedom and
inherent dynamic instability of bipedal robot structures. Previous model-based
controllers achieve precise end-effector control but rely on precise dynamics
modeling and estimation, which often struggle to capture real-world factors
(e.g., friction and backlash) and thus degrade in practice. On the other hand,
learning-based methods can better mitigate these factors via exploration and
domain randomization, and have shown potential in real-world use. However, they
often overfit to training conditions, requiring retraining with the entire
body, and still struggle to adapt to unseen scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel stable end-effector control (SEEC) framework
with model-enhanced residual learning that learns to achieve precise and robust
end-effector compensation for lower-body induced disturbances through
model-guided reinforcement learning (RL) with a perturbation generator. This
design allows the upper-body policy to achieve accurate end-effector
stabilization as well as adapt to unseen locomotion controllers with no
additional training. We validate our framework in different simulators and
transfer trained policies to the Booster T1 humanoid robot. Experiments
demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines and robustly
handles diverse and demanding loco-manipulation tasks.

*Yutong Li,Jieyi Zhang,Wenqiang Xu,Tutian Tang,Cewu Lu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces FSGlove, an inertial-based motion capture system capable of tracking 48 degrees of freedom and reconstructing personalized hand shapes with superior accuracy (error < 2.7 degrees).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing commercial gloves can track up to 21 degrees of freedom, insufficient for complex hand manipulations and neglect personalized hand shape variations critical in robotics, virtual reality, and biomechanics.

Method: FSGlove employs IMUs on finger joints and the dorsum, coupled with DiffHCal—a differentiable optimization methodology integrating with the MANO model—to achieve accurate motion tracking and calibration.

Result: FSGlove offers state-of-the-art motion capture accuracy, surpasses commercial systems in hand shape reconstruction and contact fidelity, and allows capturing subtle motions like fingertip rubbing.

Conclusion: The open-source FSGlove system unifies hand kinematics and contact fidelity, bridging human dexterity and robotic imitation, and is compatible with current VR and robotics systems.

Abstract: Accurate hand motion capture (MoCap) is vital for applications in robotics,
virtual reality, and biomechanics, yet existing systems face limitations in
capturing high-degree-of-freedom (DoF) joint kinematics and personalized hand
shape. Commercial gloves offer up to 21 DoFs, which are insufficient for
complex manipulations while neglecting shape variations that are critical for
contact-rich tasks. We present FSGlove, an inertial-based system that
simultaneously tracks up to 48 DoFs and reconstructs personalized hand shapes
via DiffHCal, a novel calibration method. Each finger joint and the dorsum are
equipped with IMUs, enabling high-resolution motion sensing. DiffHCal
integrates with the parametric MANO model through differentiable optimization,
resolving joint kinematics, shape parameters, and sensor misalignment during a
single streamlined calibration. The system achieves state-of-the-art accuracy,
with joint angle errors of less than 2.7 degree, and outperforms commercial
alternatives in shape reconstruction and contact fidelity. FSGlove's
open-source hardware and software design ensures compatibility with current VR
and robotics ecosystems, while its ability to capture subtle motions (e.g.,
fingertip rubbing) bridges the gap between human dexterity and robotic
imitation. Evaluated against Nokov optical MoCap, FSGlove advances hand
tracking by unifying the kinematic and contact fidelity. Hardware design,

*Jiyeon Koo,Taewan Cho,Hyunjoon Kang,Eunseom Pyo,Tae Gyun Oh,Taeryang Kim,Andrew Jaeyong Choi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RetoVLA reuses discarded Register Tokens in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models to improve spatial reasoning while maintaining efficiency in robotic manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large VLA models excel in robotics but are computationally expensive, and existing lightweighting techniques compromise critical reasoning capabilities.

Method: The study proposes RetoVLA, an architecture that reuses Register Tokens from Vision Transformers by injecting them into the Action Expert for better spatial reasoning.

Result: RetoVLA improves success rates by 17.1% in complex manipulation tasks on a custom 7-DOF robot arm.

Conclusion: Register Tokens, previously discarded as artifacts, provide a valuable resource for improving robotic intelligence in lightweight models without compromising performance.

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models demonstrate remarkable
generalization in robotics but are restricted by their substantial size and
computational cost, limiting real-world deployment. However, conventional
lightweighting methods often sacrifice critical capabilities, particularly
spatial reasoning. This creates a trade-off between efficiency and performance.
To address this challenge, our work reuses Register Tokens, which were
introduced for artifact removal in Vision Transformers but subsequently
discarded. We suppose that these tokens contain essential spatial information
and propose RetoVLA, a novel architecture that reuses them directly by
injecting them into the Action Expert.
  RetoVLA maintains a lightweight structure while leveraging this repurposed
spatial context to enhance reasoning. We demonstrate RetoVLA's effectiveness
through a series of comprehensive experiments. On our custom-built 7-DOF robot
arm, the model achieves a 17.1%p absolute improvement in success rates for
complex manipulation tasks. Our results confirm that reusing Register Tokens
directly enhances spatial reasoning, demonstrating that what was previously
discarded as an artifact is in fact a valuable, unexplored resource for robotic
intelligence. A video demonstration is available at:

### [363] [BiNoMaP: Learning Category-Level Bimanual Non-Prehensile Manipulation Primitives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21256)
*Huayi Zhou,Kui Jia*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for dual-arm bimanual non-prehensile manipulation tasks using a three-stage, RL-free approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-prehensile manipulation is underexplored due to its complexity and the reliance on single-arm setups or external aids. The paper seeks to advance this by introducing a generalizable dual-arm framework.

Method: The method consists of three stages: (1) Extracting hand motion trajectories from video demonstrations, (2) Refining trajectories using a geometry-aware optimization algorithm, and (3) Generalizing manipulation primitives by parameterizing them with object size and geometry.

Result: The framework, BiNoMaP, is demonstrated successfully across various tasks and object categories, showing efficiency, adaptability, and superior generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: BiNoMaP establishes a novel and practical approach for dual-arm non-prehensile manipulation tasks, departing from RL-based methods and showcasing strong potential in both specific and generalized applications.

Abstract: Non-prehensile manipulation, encompassing ungraspable actions such as
pushing, poking, and pivoting, represents a critical yet underexplored domain
in robotics due to its contact-rich and analytically intractable nature. In
this work, we revisit this problem from two novel perspectives. First, we move
beyond the usual single-arm setup and the strong assumption of favorable
external dexterity such as walls, ramps, or edges. Instead, we advocate a
generalizable dual-arm configuration and establish a suite of Bimanual
Non-prehensile Manipulation Primitives (BiNoMaP). Second, we depart from the
prevailing RL-based paradigm and propose a three-stage, RL-free framework to
learn non-prehensile skills. Specifically, we begin by extracting bimanual hand
motion trajectories from video demonstrations. Due to visual inaccuracies and
morphological gaps, these coarse trajectories are difficult to transfer
directly to robotic end-effectors. To address this, we propose a geometry-aware
post-optimization algorithm that refines raw motions into executable
manipulation primitives that conform to specific motion patterns. Beyond
instance-level reproduction, we further enable category-level generalization by
parameterizing the learned primitives with object-relevant geometric
attributes, particularly size, resulting in adaptable and general parameterized
manipulation primitives. We validate BiNoMaP across a range of representative
bimanual tasks and diverse object categories, demonstrating its effectiveness,
efficiency, versatility, and superior generalization capability.

*Babak Salamat,Dominik Mattern,Sebastian-Sven Olzem,Gerhard Elsbacher,Christian Seidel,Andrea M. Tonello*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces GMP^3, a novel multiphase global path planning framework for UAVs that optimizes 3D trajectories in cluttered environments using reinforcement learning and cooperative policy updates, validated by simulations and real flight experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of generating dynamically feasible trajectories for UAVs navigating complex and constrained 3D environments while incorporating both translational and rotational dynamics.

Method: The framework extends path planning to the Lie group SE(3), employs a modified Bellman-based operator for reinforcement learning, and uses consensus-based cooperative policy updates between distributed agents. It interfaces with real UAVs via DroneManager software.

Result: Simulation and indoor flight experiments demonstrate GMP^3's reliable obstacle avoidance, collision-free navigation, and smooth trajectory generation for both position and orientation dynamics.

Conclusion: GMP^3 successfully blends path planning and reinforcement learning for UAV trajectory optimization, showcasing practical deployment capabilities and collaborative trajectory refinement in constrained scenarios.

Abstract: We propose $\text{GMP}^{3}$, a multiphase global path planning framework that
generates dynamically feasible three-dimensional trajectories for unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs) operating in cluttered environments. The framework
extends traditional path planning from Euclidean position spaces to the Lie
group $\mathrm{SE}(3)$, allowing joint learning of translational motion and
rotational dynamics. A modified Bellman-based operator is introduced to support
reinforcement learning (RL) policy updates while leveraging prior trajectory
information for improved convergence. $\text{GMP}^{3}$ is designed as a
distributed framework in which agents influence each other and share policy
information along the trajectory: each agent refines its assigned segment and
shares with its neighbors via a consensus-based scheme, enabling cooperative
policy updates and convergence toward a path shaped globally even under
kinematic constraints. We also propose DroneManager, a modular ground control
software that interfaces the planner with real UAV platforms via the MAVLink
protocol, supporting real-time deployment and feedback. Simulation studies and
indoor flight experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in
constrained 3D environments, demonstrating reliable obstacle avoidance and
smooth, feasible trajectories across both position and orientation. The
open-source implementation is available at

### [365] [Taxonomy-aware Dynamic Motion Generation on Hyperbolic Manifolds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21281)
*Luis Augenstein,Noémie Jaquier,Tamim Asfour,Leonel Rozo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces GPHDM, a novel method for generating human-like robot motions that preserve hierarchical structures and temporal dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human motion generation models often overlook the hierarchical structure of motion taxonomies, leading to a disconnect between generated motions and their underlying structure.

Method: The GPHDM extends Gaussian Process Dynamical Model (GPDM) to the hyperbolic manifold and incorporates taxonomy-aware inductive biases. It uses three novel mechanisms for motion generation: two probabilistic recursive approaches and a pullback-metric geodesics-based method.

Result: Experiments on hand grasping taxonomy reveal that GPHDM effectively captures hierarchical structures, temporal dynamics, and generates physically consistent motion sequences.

Conclusion: GPHDM provides a geometry- and taxonomy-aware framework for generating realistic and structured human-like robotic motions, bridging the gap between hierarchical motion studies and practical motion generation models.

Abstract: Human-like motion generation for robots often draws inspiration from
biomechanical studies, which often categorize complex human motions into
hierarchical taxonomies. While these taxonomies provide rich structural
information about how movements relate to one another, this information is
frequently overlooked in motion generation models, leading to a disconnect
between the generated motions and their underlying hierarchical structure. This
paper introduces the \ac{gphdm}, a novel approach that learns latent
representations preserving both the hierarchical structure of motions and their
temporal dynamics to ensure physical consistency. Our model achieves this by
extending the dynamics prior of the Gaussian Process Dynamical Model (GPDM) to
the hyperbolic manifold and integrating it with taxonomy-aware inductive
biases. Building on this geometry- and taxonomy-aware frameworks, we propose
three novel mechanisms for generating motions that are both
taxonomically-structured and physically-consistent: two probabilistic recursive
approaches and a method based on pullback-metric geodesics. Experiments on
generating realistic motion sequences on the hand grasping taxonomy show that
the proposed GPHDM faithfully encodes the underlying taxonomy and temporal
dynamics, and generates novel physically-consistent trajectories.

### [366] [ACCeLLiuM: Supervised Fine-Tuning for Automated OpenACC Pragma Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20380)
*Samyak Jhaveri,Vanessa Klotzmann,Crista Lopes*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper presents ACCeLLiuM, fine-tuned large language models and a supervised fine-tuning dataset for generating OpenACC directives for GPUs, achieving high accuracy and practical value.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GPUs are increasingly used in parallel programming but remain complex to utilize effectively, even with abstraction layers like OpenACC. There is a need to simplify and improve the generation of OpenACC directives to reduce programming expertise requirements.

Method: The authors fine-tuned large language models on a supervised dataset of 4,033 OpenACC pragma-loop pairs mined from GitHub repositories, evaluating performance by comparing directive generation accuracy with base models.

Result: ACCeLLiuM fine-tuned models outperformed base models, generating valid OpenACC pragmas for 87% of data loops and exact matches for 50%, showcasing superior directive generation.

Conclusion: ACCeLLiuM models and dataset provide a benchmark for LLM-powered OpenACC pragma creation, aiming to simplify GPU programming and automate serial-to-parallel conversion through open-source resources.

Abstract: The increasing ubiquity of GPUs is accompanied by the increasing complexity
of their hardware and parallel programming frameworks. Directive-based parallel
programming standards like OpenACC simplify GPU programming to some extent by
abstracting away low-level complexities, but a fair amount of expertise is
still required in order to use those directives effectively.
  We introduce ACCeLLiuM, two open weights Large Language Models specifically
fine-tuned for generating expert OpenACC directives for data-parallel loops,
along with the supervised fine-tuning dataset that was used to train them. The
ACCeLLiuM SFT dataset contains 4,033 OpenACC pragma-loop pairs mined from
public GitHub C/C++ repositories, with 3,223 pairs for training and 810 for
testing. Experimental evaluations show a pronounced performance gap in
generating correct OpenACC pragmas between base LLMs and our fine-tuned
versions. On the held-out test set, base LLMs fail to consistently generate
valid pragmas, whereas LLMs fine-tuned on the ACCeLLiuM dataset generate valid
pragmas with the correct directive type for $87\%$ of the data-parallel loops,
and exact pragmas--including directives, clauses, clause order, and clause
variables--for $50\%$ of the cases. Even when not exact, generated pragmas
frequently incorporate the correct clauses in a different order than the
ground-truth label, or include additional clauses that enable finer control
over parallel execution, data movement, and concurrency, offering practical
value beyond strict string-matching. By publicly releasing the code, models,
and dataset as ACCeLLiuM we hope to establish a reproducible benchmark for
LLM-powered OpenACC pragma generation, and lower the barrier to automated GPU
offloading of serially written programs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the increasing ineffectiveness of traditional text-based and numerical methods in analyzing complex security issues due to evolving software systems and threat landscapes.

Method: The paper systematically reviews over 60 recent research papers and classifies software security visualization techniques into graph-based, notation-based, matrix-based, and metaphor-based categories.

Result: The review highlights two main areas of focus: extensive software development visualization and operational security visualization, alongside key issues, advancements, and future research opportunities in the field.

Conclusion: Innovative and adaptive visualization techniques are essential for improving threat detection, security response, and guiding further research in cybersecurity visualization.

Abstract: Software security visualization is an interdisciplinary field that combines
the technical complexity of cybersecurity, including threat intelligence and
compliance monitoring, with visual analytics, transforming complex security
data into easily digestible visual formats. As software systems get more
complex and the threat landscape evolves, traditional text-based and numerical
methods for analyzing and interpreting security concerns become increasingly
ineffective. The purpose of this paper is to systematically review existing
research and create a comprehensive taxonomy of software security visualization
techniques through literature, categorizing these techniques into four types:
graph-based, notation-based, matrix-based, and metaphor-based visualization.
This systematic review explores over 60 recent key research papers in software
security visualization, highlighting its key issues, recent advancements, and
prospective future research directions. From the comprehensive analysis, the
two main areas were distinctly highlighted as extensive software development
visualization, focusing on advanced methods for depicting software
architecture: operational security visualization and cybersecurity
visualization. The findings highlight the necessity for innovative
visualization techniques that adapt to the evolving security landscape, with
practical implications for enhancing threat detection, improving security
response strategies, and guiding future research.

TL;DR: Dynamic ReAct introduces a novel mechanism to optimize tool selection in resource-limited environments, enabling efficient use of extensive toolsets by AI agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of computational inefficiency when AI agents interact with hundreds or thousands of tools simultaneously.

Method: Five architectures are proposed for tool selection optimization, with a focus on a search-and-load mechanism that selectively activates tools based on task needs.

Result: The approach cuts tool loading by up to 50% while preserving task accuracy, demonstrating computational efficiency and adaptability.

Conclusion: The proposed system enhances the scalability and capability of general-purpose AI agents to operate efficiently in dynamic task environments.

Abstract: We present Dynamic ReAct, a novel approach for enabling ReAct agents to ef-
ficiently operate with extensive Model Control Protocol (MCP) tool sets that
exceed the contextual memory limitations of large language models. Our approach
addresses the fundamental challenge of tool selection in environments
containing hundreds or thousands of available tools, where loading all tools
simultaneously is computationally infeasible. We propose and evaluate five
distinct architectures that progressively refine the tool selection process,
culminating in a search-and-load mechanism that achieves intelligent tool
selection with minimal computational overhead. Our experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces tool loading by up to 50% while
maintaining task completion accuracy, advancing the path towards truly
general-purpose AI agents capable of dynamically adapting to diverse task
environments.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes a knowledge graph-based framework for fairness in software systems to address challenges in specifying and verifying fairness requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improperly designed software systems may lead to discrimination based on factors like gender and ethnicity, often due to missing or implicit fairness requirements.

Method: Development of a knowledge graph-based framework adapted from techniques in domains like security engineering to formalize fairness requirements and aid specification and verification.

Result: The paper introduces challenges, research questions, and a road map for developing the proposed framework, but the specific outcomes are not yet realized.

Conclusion: A structured approach, such as a knowledge graph-based framework, is essential for addressing implicit fairness knowledge and ensuring verifiable fairness requirements in software systems.

Abstract: Decisions suggested by improperly designed software systems might be prone to
discriminate against people based on protected characteristics, such as gender
and ethnicity. Previous studies attribute such undesired behavior to flaws in
algorithmic design or biased data. However, these studies ignore that
discrimination is often the result of a lack of well-specified fairness
requirements and their verification. The fact that experts' knowledge about
fairness is often implicit makes the task of specifying precise and verifiable
fairness requirements difficult. In related domains, such as security
engineering, knowledge graphs have been proven to be effective in formalizing
knowledge to assist requirements specification and verification. To address the
lack of formal mechanisms for specifying and verifying fairness requirements,
we propose the development of a knowledge graph-based framework for fairness.
In this paper, we discuss the challenges, research questions, and a road map
towards addressing the research questions.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces an AI-powered Python chatbot aimed at helping students learn programming by debugging errors, solving syntax issues, and bridging the theory-to-practice gap using static analysis, dynamic execution tracing, and LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional coding tools lack interactive, educational support and AI tools like GitHub Copilot focus more on task completion rather than enhancing learning.

Method: The chatbot integrates CodeLlama for code embedding, GPT-4 for language processing, and Docker sandboxing for safe execution, evaluated via mixed methods involving student submissions and user feedback.

Result: The system achieved an 85% error resolution success rate, reduced debugging time by 59.3%, and improved coding proficiency by 34% in targeted areas. Students appreciated its clarity and utility but noted some latency issues.

Conclusion: This research demonstrates how AI tools can balance technical innovation with pedagogy to foster conceptual understanding and skill development in programming education.

Abstract: This is the study that presents an AI-Python-based chatbot that helps
students to learn programming by demonstrating solutions to such problems as
debugging errors, solving syntax problems or converting abstract theoretical
concepts to practical implementations. Traditional coding tools like Integrated
Development Environments (IDEs) and static analyzers do not give robotic help
while AI-driven code assistants such as GitHub Copilot focus on getting things
done. To close this gap, our chatbot combines static code analysis, dynamic
execution tracing, and large language models (LLMs) to provide the students
with relevant and practical advice, hence promoting the learning process. The
chatbots hybrid architecture employs CodeLlama for code embedding, GPT-4 for
natural language interactions, and Docker-based sandboxing for secure
execution. Evaluated through a mixed-methods approach involving 1,500 student
submissions, the system demonstrated an 85% error resolution success rate,
outperforming standalone tools like pylint (62%) and GPT-4 (73%). Quantitative
results revealed a 59.3% reduction in debugging time among users, with pre- and
post-test assessments showing a 34% improvement in coding proficiency,
particularly in recursion and exception handling. Qualitative feedback from 120
students highlighted the chatbots clarity, accessibility, and
confidence-building impact, though critiques included occasional latency and
restrictive code sanitization. By balancing technical innovation with
pedagogical empathy, this research provides a blueprint for AI tools that
prioritize educational equity and long-term skill retention over mere code
completion. The chatbot exemplifies how AI can augment human instruction,
fostering deeper conceptual understanding in programming education.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Online-Optimized RAG, an adaptive framework for improving retrieval embeddings in real-time, addressing misalignment issues in retrieval-augmented generation systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Embedding misalignment often leads to task failure in RAG systems due to imperfect models or noisy descriptions, necessitating a robust solution.

Method: Online-Optimized RAG uses lightweight online gradient updates at deployment time, requiring minimal feedback and no modifications to the underlying LLM.

Result: The approach consistently improves tool selection accuracy and end-task success across varied scenarios, verified by theoretical analysis and empirical testing.

Conclusion: Online-Optimized RAG offers a practical, self-improving solution for robust RAG systems, handling scenarios like multi-hop tools and dynamic inventories effectively.

Abstract: In many applications, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) drives tool use
and function calling by embedding the (user) queries and matching them to
pre-specified tool/function descriptions. In this paper, we address an
embedding misalignment issue that often arises in practical applications due to
imperfect embedding models or noisy descriptions; such misalignment may lead to
incorrect retrieval and task failure. We introduce Online-Optimized RAG, a
deployment-time framework that continually adapts retrieval embeddings from
live interactions using minimal feedback (e.g., task success). Online-Optimized
RAG applies lightweight online gradient updates with negligible per-query
latency and requires no changes to the underlying LLM. The method is
plug-and-play: it supports both single- and multi-hop tool use, dynamic tool
inventories, and $K$-retrieval with re-ranking. We provide a problem-dependent
theoretical analysis that quantifies how the method's performance depends on
the initialization quality of the embeddings and other related quantities.
Across diverse tool-use and document-retrieval scenarios, our Online-Optimized
RAG consistently improves tool selection accuracy and end-task success, thus
providing a simple, practical path to robust, self-improving RAG systems.

Motivation: The need for a reliable way to ensure the correctness of legal contracts, especially those with asset transfers and obligations.

Method: The authors translate Stipula contracts into Java code with Java Modeling Language annotations and use the KeY deductive verification tool.

Result: They achieved fully automatic verification of correctness for many Stipula contracts with disjoint cycles.

Conclusion: The study shows that general-purpose deductive verification tools can successfully verify domain-specific contracts through translation.

Abstract: Stipula is a domain-specific programming language designed to model legal
contracts with enforceable properties, especially those involving asset
transfers and obligations. This paper presents a methodology to formally verify
the correctness of Stipula contracts through translation into Java code
annotated with Java Modeling Language specifications. As a verification
backend, the deductive verification tool KeY is used. Both, the translation and
the verification of partial and total correctness for a large subset of Stipula
contracts, those with disjoint cycles, is fully automatic. Our work
demonstrates that a general-purpose deductive verification tool can be used
successfully in a translation approach.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SpecDetect4AI, a tool to identify AI-specific code smells in software systems using a domain-specific language and static analysis, achieving high precision and recall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-based systems introduce new software issues that existing tools fail to detect, such as unreproducibility and poor model generalization.

Method: The approach uses a high-level declarative DSL for specifying rules and an extensible static analysis tool to implement these rules for scale detection in AI-based systems.

Result: SpecDetect4AI identified 22 AI-specific code smells with precision of 88.66% and recall of 88.89%, outperforming existing tools on 826 AI-based systems.

Conclusion: SpecDetect4AI effectively specifies and detects AI-specific code smells, showing scalability, efficiency, extensibility, and usability.

Abstract: The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping how software systems
are developed and maintained. However, AI-based systems give rise to new
software issues that existing detection tools often miss. Among these, we focus
on AI-specific code smells, recurring patterns in the code that may indicate
deeper problems such as unreproducibility, silent failures, or poor model
generalization. We introduce SpecDetect4AI, a tool-based approach for the
specification and detection of these code smells at scale. This approach
combines a high-level declarative Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for rule
specification with an extensible static analysis tool that interprets and
detects these rules for AI-based systems. We specified 22 AI-specific code
smells and evaluated SpecDetect4AI on 826 AI-based systems (20M lines of code),
achieving a precision of 88.66% and a recall of 88.89%, outperforming other
existing detection tools. Our results show that SpecDetect4AI supports the
specification and detection of AI-specific code smells through dedicated rules
and can effectively analyze large AI-based systems, demonstrating both
efficiency and extensibility (SUS 81.7/100).

Motivation: The paper aims to understand and address the technical debt arising uniquely in software systems that integrate large language models via APIs, as these integrations are increasingly prevalent but poorly studied in terms of SATD.

Method: The authors conducted a large-scale empirical analysis of 93,142 Python files to evaluate the origins, prevalence, and mitigation strategies of SATD in the context of LLMs. They specifically looked into common APIs like OpenAI and techniques like prompt design.

Result: The study found that SATD is prevalent, with 54.49% related to OpenAI and 12.35% to LangChain. The major contributors were prompt design (6.61%) and issues with prompt configuration, hyperparameter tuning, and framework integration. Instruction-based and few-shot prompts were highlighted as especially debt-prone.

Conclusion: The paper provides a detailed analysis of LLM-specific SATD, identifies major sources like prompt design, and presents a dataset to help further research and offer solutions for managing technical debt in LLM-powered systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in software via APIs
like OpenAI, offering powerful AI features without heavy infrastructure. Yet
these integrations bring their own form of self-admitted technical debt (SATD).
In this paper, we present the first large-scale empirical study of LLM-specific
SATD: its origins, prevalence, and mitigation strategies. By analyzing 93,142
Python files across major LLM APIs, we found that 54.49% of SATD instances stem
from OpenAI integrations and 12.35% from LangChain use. Prompt design emerged
as the primary source of LLM-specific SATD, with 6.61% of debt related to
prompt configuration and optimization issues, followed by hyperparameter tuning
and LLM-framework integration. We further explored which prompt techniques
attract the most debt, revealing that instruction-based prompts (38.60%) and
few-shot prompts (18.13%) are particularly vulnerable due to their dependence
on instruction clarity and example quality. Finally, we release a comprehensive
SATD dataset to support reproducibility and offer practical guidance for
managing technical debt in LLM-powered systems.

### [375] [Enhancing LLM-based Fault Localization with a Functionality-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Generation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20552)
*Xinyu Shi,Zhenhao Li,An Ran Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: FaR-Loc is a novel fault localization framework that integrates large language models with retrieval-augmented generation, achieving significant performance improvements in identifying faulty code elements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fault localization is challenging and time-consuming, especially in complex software systems due to the lack of project-specific knowledge and difficulty navigating large codebases.

Method: FaR-Loc comprises three components: (1) LLM Functionality Extraction to generate descriptions of failing behavior, (2) Semantic Dense Retrieval to embed and retrieve similar functional behaviors, and (3) LLM Re-ranking to refine the relevancy of retrieved methods.

Result: FaR-Loc outperforms state-of-the-art models like SoapFL and AutoFL in Top-1 and Top-5 accuracy by notable margins. Using code structure-aware models like UniXcoder boosts performance further by 49.0% in Top-1 accuracy.

Conclusion: FaR-Loc is an effective, practical advancement in fault localization that surpasses current techniques and does not require re-training. It showcases strong potential for real-world applications, benefiting debugging processes.

Abstract: Fault localization (FL) is a critical but time-consuming task in software
debugging, aiming to identify faulty code elements. While recent advances in
large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for FL, they often struggle
with complex systems due to the lack of project-specific knowledge and the
difficulty of navigating large projects. To address these limitations, we
propose FaR-Loc, a novel framework that enhances method-level FL by integrating
LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). FaR-Loc consists of three key
components: LLM Functionality Extraction, Semantic Dense Retrieval, and LLM
Re-ranking. First, given a failed test and its associated stack trace, the LLM
Functionality Extraction module generates a concise natural language
description that captures the failing behavior. Next, the Semantic Dense
Retrieval component leverages a pre-trained code-understanding encoder to embed
both the functionality description (natural language) and the covered methods
(code) into a shared semantic space, enabling the retrieval of methods with
similar functional behavior. Finally, the LLM Re-ranking module reorders the
retrieved methods based on their contextual relevance. Our experiments on the
widely used Defects4J benchmark show that FaR-Loc outperforms state-of-the-art
LLM-based baselines SoapFL and AutoFL, by 14.6% and 9.1% in Top-1 accuracy, by
19.2% and 22.1% in Top-5 accuracy, respectively. It also surpasses all
learning-based and spectrum-based baselines across all Top-N metrics without
requiring re-training. Furthermore, we find that pre-trained code embedding
models that incorporate code structure, such as UniXcoder, can significantly
improve fault localization performance by up to 49.0% in Top-1 accuracy.
Finally, we conduct a case study to illustrate the effectiveness of FaR-Loc and
to provide insights for its practical application.

### [377] [Exploring Engagement in Hybrid Meetings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20780)
*Daniela Grassi,Fabio Calefato,Darja Smite,Nicole Novielli,Filippo Lanubile*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper investigates engagement patterns in hybrid meetings, highlighting differences driven by participant location, meeting length, role activity, and session timing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The shift to hybrid work setups post-COVID-19 has introduced communication and collaboration challenges, especially impacting team engagement in meetings.

Method: Engagement levels in hybrid meetings were analyzed using a multimodal approach, combining self-reported questionnaires and biometric data collected from professionals in software companies.

Result: Engagement levels are generally similar for co-located and remote participants but drop for remote participants in long meetings. Active roles boost engagement, while larger meetings and afternoon sessions lower it.

Conclusion: Insights from the study can guide improvements in hybrid meetings and offer valuable recommendations for knowledge-intensive organizations navigating collaboration in hybrid settings.

Abstract: Background. The widespread adoption of hybrid work following the COVID-19
pandemic has fundamentally transformed software development practices,
introducing new challenges in communication and collaboration as organizations
transition from traditional office-based structures to flexible working
arrangements. This shift has established a new organizational norm where even
traditionally office-first companies now embrace hybrid team structures. While
remote participation in meetings has become commonplace in this new
environment, it may lead to isolation, alienation, and decreased engagement
among remote team members. Aims. This study aims to identify and characterize
engagement patterns in hybrid meetings through objective measurements, focusing
on the differences between co-located and remote participants. Method. We
studied professionals from three software companies over several weeks,
employing a multimodal approach to measure engagement. Data were collected
through self-reported questionnaires and physiological measurements using
biometric devices during hybrid meetings to understand engagement dynamics.
Results. The regression analyses revealed comparable engagement levels between
onsite and remote participants, though remote participants show lower
engagement in long meetings regardless of participation mode. Active roles
positively correlate with higher engagement, while larger meetings and
afternoon sessions are associated with lower engagement. Conclusions. Our
results offer insights into factors associated with engagement and
disengagement in hybrid meetings, as well as potential meeting improvement
recommendations. These insights are potentially relevant not only for software
teams but also for knowledge-intensive organizations across various sectors
facing similar hybrid collaboration challenges.

### [378] [Verification Limits Code LLM Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20837)
*Srishti Gureja,Elena Tommasone,Jingyi He,Sara Hooker,Matthias Gallé,Marzieh Fadaee*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper studies the impact of verification design and strategies in code generation models relying on synthetic data, identifying limitations and suggesting ways to improve training data quality and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitation of synthetic data generation for code models, which is constrained by the quality of verifiers used – a challenge termed the 'verification ceiling.'

Method: The study investigates the impact of different aspects of verification, including test complexity, pass thresholds, and the role of diversity in training data, using controlled experiments.

Result: Key findings indicate that richer test suites enhance code generation performance, relaxed pass thresholds recover useful data, and maintaining diverse correct solutions supports generalization gains. However, verification must be recalibrated to maximize its utility.

Conclusion: Current verification methods in code model training are overly rigid, restricting diversity. By recalibrating verification and emphasizing challenging problem-solution diversity, it's possible to improve code generation capabilities beyond the existing verification ceiling.

Abstract: Large language models for code generation increasingly rely on synthetic
data, where both problem solutions and verification tests are generated by
models. While this enables scalable data creation, it introduces a previously
unexplored bottleneck: the verification ceiling, in which the quality and
diversity of training data are fundamentally constrained by the capabilities of
synthetic verifiers. In this work, we systematically study how verification
design and strategies influence model performance. We investigate (i) what we
verify by analyzing the impact of test complexity and quantity: richer test
suites improve code generation capabilities (on average +3 pass@1), while
quantity alone yields diminishing returns, (ii) how we verify by exploring
relaxed pass thresholds: rigid 100% pass criteria can be overly restrictive. By
allowing for relaxed thresholds or incorporating LLM-based soft verification,
we can recover valuable training data, leading to a 2-4 point improvement in
pass@1 performance. However, this benefit is contingent upon the strength and
diversity of the test cases used, and (iii) why verification remains necessary
through controlled comparisons of formally correct versus incorrect solutions
and human evaluation: retaining diverse correct solutions per problem yields
consistent generalization gains. Our results show that Verification as
currently practiced is too rigid, filtering out valuable diversity. But it
cannot be discarded, only recalibrated. By combining calibrated verification
with diverse, challenging problem-solution pairs, we outline a path to break
the verification ceiling and unlock stronger code generation models.

### [379] [PseudoBridge: Pseudo Code as the Bridge for Better Semantic and Logic Alignment in Code Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20881)
*Yixuan Li,Xinyi Liu,Weidong Yang,Ben Fei,Shuhao Li,Mingjie Zhou,Lipeng Ma*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: PseudoBridge is a framework enhancing code search by using pseudo-code as an intermediary, offering improved accuracy and robustness across programming languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the semantic gap between natural language and programming language, along with robustness issues in code search using pre-trained language models.

Method: The framework employs a two-stage approach: synthesizing pseudo-code using a large language model (LLM) and generating stylistically diverse yet logically equivalent code snippets to align with pseudo-code.

Result: PseudoBridge demonstrates consistent performance improvements in code retrieval accuracy and generalization across 10 PLMs and several programming languages, particularly excelling in zero-shot domain transfer scenarios.

Conclusion: PseudoBridge effectively bridges the semantic gap using pseudo-code and provides a robust, generalizable method for enhanced code retrieval.

Abstract: Code search aims to precisely find relevant code snippets that match natural
language queries within massive codebases, playing a vital role in software
development. Recent advances leverage pre-trained language models (PLMs) to
bridge the semantic gap between unstructured natural language (NL) and
structured programming languages (PL), yielding significant improvements over
traditional information retrieval and early deep learning approaches. However,
existing PLM-based methods still encounter key challenges, including a
fundamental semantic gap between human intent and machine execution logic, as
well as limited robustness to diverse code styles. To address these issues, we
propose PseudoBridge, a novel code retrieval framework that introduces
pseudo-code as an intermediate, semi-structured modality to better align NL
semantics with PL logic. Specifically, PseudoBridge consists of two stages.
First, we employ an advanced large language model (LLM) to synthesize
pseudo-code, enabling explicit alignment between NL queries and pseudo-code.
Second, we introduce a logic-invariant code style augmentation strategy and
employ the LLM to generate stylistically diverse yet logically equivalent code
implementations with pseudo-code, then align the code snippets of different
styles with pseudo-code, enhancing model robustness to code style variation. We
build PseudoBridge across 10 different PLMs and evaluate it on 6 mainstream
programming languages. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PseudoBridge
consistently outperforms baselines, achieving significant gains in retrieval
accuracy and generalization, particularly under zero-shot domain transfer
scenarios such as Solidity and XLCoST datasets. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of explicit logical alignment via pseudo-code and highlight
PseudoBridge's potential as a robust, generalizable solution for code
retrieval.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'CodeHinter,' a tool combining traditional debugging with LLM techniques to aid novice programmers in fixing errors while fostering active engagement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of novice programmers becoming overly reliant on AI debugging tools and to actively engage them in the debugging process.

Method: Developed and tested 'CodeHinter,' blending traditional debugging tools with LLMs and evaluated its effectiveness with undergraduate students during its second design iteration.

Result: Students found the tool effective in resolving semantic errors, easier to use than the first version, and appreciated its error localization feature.

Conclusion: AI-assisted debugging tools should be tailored to individual user profiles to enhance their utility for students.

Abstract: Debugging is a fundamental skill that novice programmers must develop.
Numerous tools have been created to assist novice programmers in this process.
Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been integrated with automated
program repair techniques to generate fixes for students' buggy code. However,
many of these tools foster an over-reliance on AI and do not actively engage
students in the debugging process. In this work, we aim to design an intuitive
debugging assistant, CodeHinter, that combines traditional debugging tools with
LLM-based techniques to help novice debuggers fix semantic errors while
promoting active engagement in the debugging process. We present findings from
our second design iteration, which we tested with a group of undergraduate
students. Our results indicate that the students found the tool highly
effective in resolving semantic errors and significantly easier to use than the
first version. Consistent with our previous study, error localization was the
most valuable feature. Finally, we conclude that any AI-assisted debugging tool
should be personalized based on user profiles to optimize their interactions
with students.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in Quantum Software Engineering (QSE), using Stack Overflow data to classify quantum computing discussions with Transformer-based models, achieving higher accuracy than traditional machine learning approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the frequent challenges faced by quantum developers, improve classification of discussions, and enhance transparency in organizing quantum forums for accessibility.

Method: The authors extracted 2829 quantum-tagged posts from Q&A platforms, used content analysis and grounded theory to annotate challenges, trained Transformer-based models (BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa), and validated annotations with ChatGPT.

Result: Transformer-based classifiers achieved an average accuracy of 95%, outperforming traditional D&ML methods by up to 6%. Model interpretability was enhanced using SHAP to explain linguistic feature-driven predictions.

Conclusion: The findings improve organizing discussions in quantum computing forums, making them more accessible to developers, but further evaluation studies with actual users are necessary for practical validation.

Abstract: Quantum Software Engineering (QSE) is a research area practiced by tech
firms. Quantum developers face challenges in optimizing quantum computing and
QSE concepts. They use Stack Overflow (SO) to discuss challenges and label
posts with specialized quantum tags, which often refer to technical aspects
rather than developer posts. Categorizing questions based on quantum concepts
can help identify frequent QSE challenges. We conducted studies to classify
questions into various challenges. We extracted 2829 questions from Q&A
platforms using quantum-related tags. Posts were analyzed to identify frequent
challenges and develop a novel grounded theory. Challenges include Tooling,
Theoretical, Learning, Conceptual, Errors, and API Usage. Through content
analysis and grounded theory, discussions were annotated with common challenges
to develop a ground truth dataset. ChatGPT validated human annotations and
resolved disagreements. Fine-tuned transformer algorithms, including BERT,
DistilBERT, and RoBERTa, classified discussions into common challenges. We
achieved an average accuracy of 95% with BERT DistilBERT, compared to
fine-tuned Deep and Machine Learning (D&ML) classifiers, including Feedforward
Neural Networks (FNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Long Short-Term
Memory networks (LSTM), which achieved accuracies of 89%, 86%, and 84%,
respectively. The Transformer-based approach outperforms the D&ML-based
approach with a 6\% increase in accuracy by processing actual discussions,
i.e., without data augmentation. We applied SHAP (SHapley Additive
exPlanations) for model interpretability, revealing how linguistic features
drive predictions and enhancing transparency in classification. These findings
can help quantum vendors and forums better organize discussions for improved
access and readability. However,empirical evaluation studies with actual
developers and vendors are needed.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces MelcotCR, a chain-of-thought fine-tuning approach for large language models (LLMs) to improve automated code review by facilitating reasoning across multiple dimensions of code analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are promising for code review but fall short compared to human reviewers due to limited reasoning capabilities and insufficient fine-tuning data.

Method: The authors propose MelcotCR, leveraging chain-of-thought fine-tuning and the Maximum Entropy modeling principle to fine-tune LLMs for reasoning across multiple dimensions using structured prompts.

Result: Empirical evaluations show that a low-parameter base model like 14B Qwen2.5 trained with MelcotCR exceeds state-of-the-art methods in identifying code issues, performing comparably to much larger models like 671B DeepSeek-R1.

Conclusion: MelcotCR enhances the efficiency and accuracy of LLMs in code reviews, showing the potential of specialized fine-tuning with structured reasoning approaches to match or exceed state-of-the-art outcomes.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in supporting
automated code review due to their impressive capabilities in context
understanding and reasoning. However, these capabilities are still limited
compared to human-level cognition because they are heavily influenced by the
training data. Recent research has demonstrated significantly improved
performance through fine-tuning LLMs with code review data. However, compared
to human reviewers who often simultaneously analyze multiple dimensions of code
review to better identify issues, the full potential of these methods is
hampered by the limited or vague information used to fine-tune the models. This
paper contributes MelcotCR, a chain-of-thought (COT) fine-tuning approach that
trains LLMs with an impressive reasoning ability to analyze multiple dimensions
of code review by harnessing long COT techniques to provide rich structured
information. To address context loss and reasoning logic loss issues that
frequently occur when LLMs process long COT prompts, we propose a solution that
combines the Maximum Entropy (ME) modeling principle with pre-defined reasoning
pathways in MelcotCR to enable more effective utilization of in-context
knowledge within long COT prompts while strengthening the logical tightness of
the reasoning process. Empirical evaluations on our curated MelcotCR dataset
and the public CodeReviewer dataset reveal that a low-parameter base model,
such as 14B Qwen2.5, fine-tuned with MelcotCR can surpass state-of-the-art
methods in terms of the accuracy of detecting and describing code issues, with
its performance remarkably on par with that of the 671B DeepSeek-R1 model.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a combined approach of BERTopic, seed words, and large language models for processing citizen input on digital platforms, addressing challenges with manual classification and taxonomy alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Governments face challenges in organizing vast contributions on digital platforms, including inefficiency of manual classification, need for expert input, and necessity for aligning with official taxonomies.

Method: The methodology combines the BERTopic technique, integration of seed words, and automated validation using large language models to classify and organize citizen input.

Result: Initial findings demonstrate that the generated topics are coherent, institutionally aligned, and require minimal human intervention.

Conclusion: The proposed approach could help governments efficiently turn massive citizen contributions into actionable insights for public policy.

Abstract: Promoting participation on digital platforms such as Brasil Participativo has
emerged as a top priority for governments worldwide. However, due to the sheer
volume of contributions, much of this engagement goes underutilized, as
organizing it presents significant challenges: (1) manual classification is
unfeasible at scale; (2) expert involvement is required; and (3) alignment with
official taxonomies is necessary. In this paper, we introduce an approach that
combines BERTopic with seed words and automatic validation by large language
models. Initial results indicate that the generated topics are coherent and
institutionally aligned, with minimal human effort. This methodology enables
governments to transform large volumes of citizen input into actionable data
for public policy.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The study links subjective cognitive concerns in older adults to weaker neural responses during speech perception, especially with flat prosody.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the neural underpinnings of subjective cognitive decline during speech perception in cognitively normal older adults.

Method: EEG was recorded from 56 older adults listening to speech with varying prosodic styles. Neural responses were analyzed using encoding models to correlate EEG with acoustic and linguistic features.

Result: Stronger cognitive concerns correlated with weaker cortical tracking of higher-level linguistic cues, particularly in less dynamic speech styles.

Conclusion: Cortical tracking of prosody and linguistic details can serve as indicators of early cognitive decline.

Abstract: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) approximately doubles the risk of
progressing to MCI and dementia. The present study investigates how one's
subjective concerns of his/her own cognition are manifested in the neural
dynamics during speech perception. EEG was collected from 56 Cantonese,
cognitively normal older adults (aged 60 - 70) while they listened to stimuli
of four expressive styles that varied in prosody: scrambled, descriptive,
dialogue, and exciting. Using encoding models to predict EEG signals from
acoustic, segmentation, and phonotactic features, we found that greater
subjective concern was associated with weaker cortical tracking of (1)
higher-level linguistic features but not acoustic features and (2) less
engaging stimuli (scrambled and descriptive styles) but not prosodically rich
stimuli. Overall, our results suggest that early signs of cognitive impairment
can be revealed from speech perception via cortical tracking, especially while
listening to prosodically flat speech.

We completely characterize learnability in this model in terms of

*Khai Nguyen,Hai Nguyen,Nhat Ho*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper presents a fast method to estimate Wasserstein distances using sliced Wasserstein distances for multiple distribution pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to efficiently compute Wasserstein distances for multiple distribution pairs sampled from a meta-distribution, which can be computationally intensive.

Method: The authors propose leveraging standard and lifted sliced Wasserstein (SW) distances within linear regression models (constrained and unconstrained) to approximate Wasserstein distances.

Result: The proposed models, trained on a small dataset, predict Wasserstein distances effectively and outperform the state-of-the-art Wasserstein embedding model in diverse tasks and datasets, especially in low-data settings.

Conclusion: The method improves upon existing techniques in accuracy and efficiency, with applications ranging from point cloud classification to accelerating training of Wasserstein Wormhole models.

Abstract: We address the problem of efficiently computing Wasserstein distances for
multiple pairs of distributions drawn from a meta-distribution. To this end, we
propose a fast estimation method based on regressing Wasserstein distance on
sliced Wasserstein (SW) distances. Specifically, we leverage both standard SW
distances, which provide lower bounds, and lifted SW distances, which provide
upper bounds, as predictors of the true Wasserstein distance. To ensure
parsimony, we introduce two linear models: an unconstrained model with a
closed-form least-squares solution, and a constrained model that uses only half
as many parameters. We show that accurate models can be learned from a small
number of distribution pairs. Once estimated, the model can predict the
Wasserstein distance for any pair of distributions via a linear combination of
SW distances, making it highly efficient. Empirically, we validate our approach
on diverse tasks, including Gaussian mixtures, point-cloud classification, and
Wasserstein-space visualizations for 3D point clouds. Across various datasets
such as MNIST point clouds, ShapeNetV2, MERFISH Cell Niches, and scRNA-seq, our
method consistently provides a better approximation of Wasserstein distance
than the state-of-the-art Wasserstein embedding model, Wasserstein Wormhole,
particularly in low-data regimes. Finally, we demonstrate that our estimator
can also accelerate Wormhole training, yielding \textit{RG-Wormhole}.

TL;DR: The paper addresses unsupervised domain adaptation where a subpopulation in the source domain is unobservable, introducing a method to recover predictive performance in the target domain despite this missing group.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to handle scenarios in unsupervised domain adaptation where structured missingness in source domain subpopulations introduces bias and degrades predictive performance.

Method: The authors propose a distribution matching method to estimate subpopulation proportions, with theoretical guarantees and error bounds for predictions.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms naive approaches ignoring the unobservable subpopulation.

Conclusion: The study confirms that even with missing subpopulations in the source domain, accurate prediction in the target domain is feasible through their proposed method.

Abstract: We study an unsupervised domain adaptation problem where the source domain
consists of subpopulations defined by the binary label $Y$ and a binary
background (or environment) $A$. We focus on a challenging setting in which one
such subpopulation in the source domain is unobservable. Naively ignoring this
unobserved group can result in biased estimates and degraded predictive
performance. Despite this structured missingness, we show that the prediction
in the target domain can still be recovered. Specifically, we rigorously derive
both background-specific and overall prediction models for the target domain.
For practical implementation, we propose the distribution matching method to
estimate the subpopulation proportions. We provide theoretical guarantees for
the asymptotic behavior of our estimator, and establish an upper bound on the
prediction error. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show
that our method outperforms the naive benchmark that does not account for this
unobservable source subpopulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand and extend the role of gapped scale-sensitive dimensions in statistical and online learning, especially in bounding convergence rates and controlling complexity measures like covering numbers.

Method: The authors analyze gapped scale-sensitive dimensions and relate them to covering numbers and offset Rademacher averages using mathematical proofs and generalizations of prior results.

Result: The gapped dimensions were shown to control covering numbers of uniformly bounded classes and provide lower bounds for offset Rademacher averages, strengthening the theoretical tools available in statistical and online learning.

Conclusion: Gapped scale-sensitive dimensions are valuable tools for understanding the complexity of function classes and improving bounds for convergence rates in learning theory.

Abstract: We study gapped scale-sensitive dimensions of a function class in both
sequential and non-sequential settings. We demonstrate that covering numbers
for any uniformly bounded class are controlled above by these gapped
dimensions, generalizing the results of
\cite{anthony2000function,alon1997scale}. Moreover, we show that the gapped
dimensions lead to lower bounds on offset Rademacher averages, thereby
strengthening existing approaches for proving lower bounds on rates of

*Joaquim Valerio Teixeira,Ed Reznik,Sudpito Banerjee,Wesley Tansey*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper develops a scalable Bayesian framework to analyze spatial data from biological imaging technologies by improving molecule signal recovery, outperforming existing methods in efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spatial data analysis from biological imaging technologies is challenging due to signal convolution in pixels, requiring improved methods for recovering molecule distributions.

Method: The paper employs a Bayesian framework with a heavy-tailed graphical lasso prior and hierarchical variational family for efficient inference using automatic differentiation variational inference.

Result: Simulations show improved performance over existing methods and better anatomical structure recovery, artifact removal, and detection of active regions in real imaging data.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a more accurate and efficient approach to analyzing spatial data from biological imaging, addressing key limitations of traditional methodologies.

Abstract: The analysis of spatial data from biological imaging technology, such as
imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) or imaging mass cytometry (IMC), is challenging
because of a competitive sampling process which convolves signals from
molecules in a single pixel. To address this, we develop a scalable Bayesian
framework that leverages natural sparsity in spatial signal patterns to recover
relative rates for each molecule across the entire image. Our method relies on
the use of a heavy-tailed variant of the graphical lasso prior and a novel
hierarchical variational family, enabling efficient inference via automatic
differentiation variational inference. Simulation results show that our
approach outperforms state-of-the-practice point estimate methodologies in IMS,
and has superior posterior coverage than mean-field variational inference
techniques. Results on real IMS data demonstrate that our approach better
recovers the true anatomical structure of known tissue, removes artifacts, and
detects active regions missed by the standard analysis approach.

*Wandi Xu,Wei Xie*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: RAPTOR-GEN is a Bayesian framework using probabilistic knowledge graphs for rapid biopharmaceutical process modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiency in current biopharmaceutical manufacturing processes for rapid and on-demand production.

Method: Developed RAPTOR-GEN using a multi-scale probabilistic knowledge graph and Bayesian sampling incorporating Langevin diffusion.

Result: Effective uncovering of regulatory mechanisms in biomanufacturing through numerical experiments.

Conclusion: RAPTOR-GEN offers a robust algorithm for intelligent bioprocess modeling with provable performance guarantees.

Abstract: Biopharmaceutical manufacturing is vital to public health but lacks the
agility for rapid, on-demand production of biotherapeutics due to the
complexity and variability of bioprocesses. To overcome this, we introduce
RApid PosTeriOR GENerator (RAPTOR-GEN), a mechanism-informed Bayesian learning
framework designed to accelerate intelligent digital twin development from
sparse and heterogeneous experimental data. This framework is built on a
multi-scale probabilistic knowledge graph (pKG), formulated as a stochastic
differential equation (SDE)-based foundational model that captures the
nonlinear dynamics of bioprocesses. RAPTOR-GEN consists of two ingredients: (i)
an interpretable metamodel integrating linear noise approximation (LNA) that
exploits the structural information of bioprocessing mechanisms and a
sequential learning strategy to fuse heterogeneous and sparse data, enabling
inference of latent state variables and explicit approximation of the
intractable likelihood function; and (ii) an efficient Bayesian posterior
sampling method that utilizes Langevin diffusion (LD) to accelerate posterior
exploration by exploiting the gradients of the derived likelihood. It
generalizes the LNA approach to circumvent the challenge of step size
selection, facilitating robust learning of mechanistic parameters with provable
finite-sample performance guarantees. We develop a fast and robust RAPTOR-GEN
algorithm with controllable error. Numerical experiments demonstrate its
effectiveness in uncovering the underlying regulatory mechanisms of
biomanufacturing processes.

*Yanfeng Yang,Siwei Chen,Pingping Hu,Zhaotong Shen,Yingjie Zhang,Zhuoran Sun,Shuai Li,Ziqi Chen,Kenji Fukumizu*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes Conditionally Whitened Generative Models (CW-Gen) for probabilistic forecasting of multivariate time series, leveraging prior information to improve sample quality and address challenges like non-stationarity and distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of recent generative models in capturing non-stationarity, inter-variable dependencies, and handling distribution shifts in multivariate time series forecasting.

Method: The authors propose the CW-Gen framework, which integrates prior information through conditional whitening. They develop a Joint Mean-Covariance Estimator (JMCE) for learning conditional mean and covariance, and extend the framework to diffusion and flow matching models, termed CW-Diff and CW-Flow.

Result: Experiments on five real-world datasets and comparisons with six state-of-the-art generative models show that CW-Gen consistently improves predictive performance and better captures non-stationary dynamics and variable correlations. It also mitigates distribution shift effects.

Conclusion: CW-Gen successfully enhances generative modeling for multivariate time series by incorporating conditional priors, offering improved predictive capabilities and robustness to distribution changes.

Abstract: Probabilistic forecasting of multivariate time series is challenging due to
non-stationarity, inter-variable dependencies, and distribution shifts. While
recent diffusion and flow matching models have shown promise, they often ignore
informative priors such as conditional means and covariances. In this work, we
propose Conditionally Whitened Generative Models (CW-Gen), a framework that
incorporates prior information through conditional whitening. Theoretically, we
establish sufficient conditions under which replacing the traditional terminal
distribution of diffusion models, namely the standard multivariate normal, with
a multivariate normal distribution parameterized by estimators of the
conditional mean and covariance improves sample quality. Guided by this
analysis, we design a novel Joint Mean-Covariance Estimator (JMCE) that
simultaneously learns the conditional mean and sliding-window covariance.
Building on JMCE, we introduce Conditionally Whitened Diffusion Models
(CW-Diff) and extend them to Conditionally Whitened Flow Matching (CW-Flow).
Experiments on five real-world datasets with six state-of-the-art generative
models demonstrate that CW-Gen consistently enhances predictive performance,
capturing non-stationary dynamics and inter-variable correlations more
effectively than prior-free approaches. Empirical results further demonstrate
that CW-Gen can effectively mitigate the effects of distribution shift.

### [392] [Empirical PAC-Bayes bounds for Markov chains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20985)
*Vahe Karagulyan,Pierre Alquier*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new PAC-Bayes bound for Markov chains, leveraging an empirical pseudo-spectral gap for better applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PAC-Bayes bounds for temporal data depend on theoretical constants (e.g., mixing coefficients, spectral gap) which are impractical to estimate empirically. This paper addresses that limitation.

Method: The authors propose a new PAC-Bayes bound utilizing the pseudo-spectral gap of Markov chains and demonstrate how this gap can be empirically estimated in finite-state cases.

Result: The developed empirical PAC-Bayes bound is shown to perform comparably to traditional non-empirical bounds and provides practical applicability through simulated experiments.

Conclusion: The paper achieves the first fully empirical PAC-Bayes bound for Markov chains, handling temporal dependence effectively while maintaining tightness of the bound.

Abstract: The core of generalization theory was developed for independent observations.
Some PAC and PAC-Bayes bounds are available for data that exhibit a temporal
dependence. However, there are constants in these bounds that depend on
properties of the data-generating process: mixing coefficients, mixing time,
spectral gap... Such constants are unknown in practice. In this paper, we prove
a new PAC-Bayes bound for Markov chains. This bound depends on a quantity
called the pseudo-spectral gap. The main novelty is that we can provide an
empirical bound on the pseudo-spectral gap when the state space is finite.
Thus, we obtain the first fully empirical PAC-Bayes bound for Markov chains.
This extends beyond the finite case, although this requires additional
assumptions. On simulated experiments, the empirical version of the bound is
essentially as tight as the non-empirical one.

*Junpei Komiyama,Daisuke Oba,Masafumi Oyamada*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper explores the limit of Best-of-$N$ using large language models (LLMs) and introduces adaptive generation and weighted ensembles to optimize computation and results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve the efficiency and performance in using large language models, especially focusing on scenarios with computation constraints.

Method: The paper investigates Best-of-$\infty$, proposes adaptive generation to dynamically determine $N$ based on agreement, and introduces weighted ensembles for combining LLMs. Optimization is done via a mixed-integer linear program.

Result: Experiments validated the proposed adaptations, showing notable improvements in performance and computation allocation.

Conclusion: Both adaptive Best-of-$N$ generation and weighted ensembles can outperform existing methods, offering better efficiency and accuracy in large language model applications.

Abstract: We study best-of-$N$ for large language models (LLMs) where the selection is
based on majority voting. In particular, we analyze the limit $N \to \infty$,
which we denote as Best-of-$\infty$. While this approach achieves impressive
performance in the limit, it requires an infinite test-time budget. To address
this, we propose an adaptive generation scheme that selects $N$ based on answer
agreement, thereby efficiently allocating inference-time computation. Beyond
adaptivity, we extend the framework to weighted ensembles of multiple LLMs,
showing that such mixtures can outperform any individual model. The optimal
ensemble weighting is formulated and efficiently computed as a mixed-integer
linear program. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach.

### [394] [WISER: Segmenting watermarked region - an epidemic change-point perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21160)
*Soham Bonnerjee,Sayar Karmakar,Subhrajyoty Roy*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: WISER is a novel watermark segmentation algorithm for identifying watermarked segments within mixed-source text, offering both accuracy and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of detecting and localizing watermarked segments within mixed-source texts, which is crucial for verifying content authenticity, is underexplored. Existing methods either lack scalability or robustness against paraphrasing and editing.

Method: The paper adopts concepts from epidemic change-point detection to devise WISER, a computationally efficient watermark segmentation algorithm, supported by theoretical validations, including finite sample error-bounds and consistency.

Result: WISER demonstrates superior accuracy and computational speed in identifying watermarked segments compared to state-of-the-art methods across diverse datasets and watermarking schemes.

Conclusion: This work establishes WISER as an effective and scalable solution for watermark localization, emphasizing how classical statistical techniques can address modern challenges in text authenticity verification.

Abstract: With the increasing popularity of large language models, concerns over
content authenticity have led to the development of myriad watermarking
schemes. These schemes can be used to detect a machine-generated text via an
appropriate key, while being imperceptible to readers with no such keys. The
corresponding detection mechanisms usually take the form of statistical
hypothesis testing for the existence of watermarks, spurring extensive research
in this direction. However, the finer-grained problem of identifying which
segments of a mixed-source text are actually watermarked, is much less
explored; the existing approaches either lack scalability or theoretical
guarantees robust to paraphrase and post-editing. In this work, we introduce a
unique perspective to such watermark segmentation problems through the lens of
epidemic change-points. By highlighting the similarities as well as differences
of these two problems, we motivate and propose WISER: a novel, computationally
efficient, watermark segmentation algorithm. We theoretically validate our
algorithm by deriving finite sample error-bounds, and establishing its
consistency in detecting multiple watermarked segments in a single text.
Complementing these theoretical results, our extensive numerical experiments
show that WISER outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods, both in terms of
computational speed as well as accuracy, on various benchmark datasets embedded
with diverse watermarking schemes. Our theoretical and empirical findings
establish WISER as an effective tool for watermark localization in most
settings. It also shows how insights from a classical statistical problem can
lead to a theoretically valid and computationally efficient solution of a
modern and pertinent problem.

### [395] [Breaking the curse of dimensionality for linear rules: optimal predictors over the ellipsoid](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21174)
*Alexis Ayme,Bruno Loureiro*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper explores how minimal structural assumptions can prevent learning bound degradation with increasing dimensionality in statistical settings, focusing on linear predictors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is driven by the need to understand the minimal assumptions required to ensure robust statistical learning bounds in high-dimensional settings.

Method: The authors derived non-asymptotic bounds for generalization error and lower bounds for rotationally invariant linear predictors under specific conditions.

Result: Key findings include (a) a variance-like term capturing data's intrinsic dimensionality and (b) a noiseless error arising in high dimensions.

Conclusion: Structural assumptions, such as the predictor lying in an ellipsoid, are critical to addressing high-dimensional challenges and mitigating the curse of dimensionality.

Abstract: In this work, we address the following question: What minimal structural
assumptions are needed to prevent the degradation of statistical learning
bounds with increasing dimensionality? We investigate this question in the
classical statistical setting of signal estimation from $n$ independent linear
observations $Y_i = X_i^{\top}\theta + \epsilon_i$. Our focus is on the
generalization properties of a broad family of predictors that can be expressed
as linear combinations of the training labels, $f(X) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} l_{i}(X)
Y_i$. This class -- commonly referred to as linear prediction rules --
encompasses a wide range of popular parametric and non-parametric estimators,
including ridge regression, gradient descent, and kernel methods. Our
contributions are twofold. First, we derive non-asymptotic upper and lower
bounds on the generalization error for this class under the assumption that the
Bayes predictor $\theta$ lies in an ellipsoid. Second, we establish a lower
bound for the subclass of rotationally invariant linear prediction rules when
the Bayes predictor is fixed. Our analysis highlights two fundamental
contributions to the risk: (a) a variance-like term that captures the intrinsic
dimensionality of the data; (b) the noiseless error, a term that arises
specifically in the high-dimensional regime. These findings shed light on the
role of structural assumptions in mitigating the curse of dimensionality.

*Andrew Gordon Wilson,Zhiting Hu,Ruslan Salakhutdinov,Eric P. Xing*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper critiques Ober et al. (2021) by analyzing the impact of kernel reparametrization on data fit and complexity. It argues that both factors still influence kernel hyperparameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the claims made by Ober et al. (2021) regarding kernel reparametrization and its influence on kernel hyperparameters.

Method: Analyzing how reparametrization of the signal variance coefficient introduces additional data-fit components to influence kernel hyperparameters.

Result: The paper demonstrates that the kernel reparametrization maintains a balance between data fit and complexity penalty, contrary to Ober et al.'s findings.

Conclusion: The complexity and data fit interplay significantly affects kernel hyperparameters, discrediting Ober et al.'s argument of complexity penalty domination.

Abstract: This note responds to "Promises and Pitfalls of Deep Kernel Learning" (Ober
et al., 2021). The marginal likelihood of a Gaussian process can be
compartmentalized into a data fit term and a complexity penalty. Ober et al.
(2021) shows that if a kernel can be multiplied by a signal variance
coefficient, then reparametrizing and substituting in the maximized value of
this parameter sets a reparametrized data fit term to a fixed value. They use
this finding to argue that the complexity penalty, a log determinant of the
kernel matrix, then dominates in determining the other values of kernel
hyperparameters, which can lead to data overcorrelation. By contrast, we show
that the reparametrization in fact introduces another data-fit term which
influences all other kernel hyperparameters. Thus, a balance between data fit
and complexity still plays a significant role in determining kernel
hyperparameters.

*Niclas Pokel,Pehuén Moure,Roman Boehringer,Yingqiang Gao*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This work proposes a novel method leveraging phoneme-level uncertainty and oversampling to improve ASR performance on non-normative speech.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR systems face difficulty with non-normative speech due to high variability and lack of data, motivating the need for targeted approaches.

Method: The authors use Monte Carlo Dropout to estimate phoneme-level uncertainty and oversample difficult phonemes to fine-tune ASR models.

Result: The proposed approach aligns model uncertainty with expert clinical assessment and significantly improves ASR accuracy.

Conclusion: This work presents a practical and data-efficient framework for improving ASR inclusivity and personalization for individuals with speech impairments.

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems struggle with non-normative speech
from individuals with impairments caused by conditions like cerebral palsy or
structural anomalies. The high acoustic variability and scarcity of training
data severely degrade model performance. This work introduces a data-efficient
personalization method that quantifies phoneme-level uncertainty to guide
fine-tuning. We leverage Monte Carlo Dropout to estimate which phonemes a model
finds most difficult and use these estimates for a targeted oversampling
strategy. We validate our method on English and German datasets. Crucially, we
demonstrate that our model-derived uncertainty strongly correlates with
phonemes identified as challenging in an expert clinical logopedic report,
marking, to our knowledge, the first work to successfully align model
uncertainty with expert assessment of speech difficulty. Our results show that
this clinically-validated, uncertainty-guided sampling significantly improves
ASR accuracy, delivering a practical framework for personalized and inclusive
ASR.

*Niclas Pokel,Pehuén Moure,Roman Boehringer,Shih-Chii Liu,Yingqiang Gao*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Bayesian Low-rank Adaptation method for personalizing ASR systems to improve recognition of impaired speech, with validation on two datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of building effective ASR systems for individuals with speech impairments, due to limited training data, high acoustic variability, and burdensome data collection.

Method: The proposed ASR personalization method uses Bayesian Low-rank Adaptation for data-efficient fine-tuning, applied to English and German datasets.

Result: Significant improvement in ASR accuracy for speech-impaired individuals is achieved while maintaining efficiency in data and annotation requirements.

Conclusion: The approach offers a practical and inclusive solution for enhancing ASR systems for non-normative speech in low-resource scenarios.

Abstract: Speech impairments resulting from congenital disorders, such as cerebral
palsy, down syndrome, or apert syndrome, as well as acquired brain injuries due
to stroke, traumatic accidents, or tumors, present major challenges to
automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. Despite recent advancements,
state-of-the-art ASR models like Whisper still struggle with non-normative
speech due to limited training data availability and high acoustic variability.
Moreover, collecting and annotating non-normative speech is burdensome:
speaking is effortful for many affected individuals, while laborious annotation
often requires caregivers familiar with the speaker. This work introduces a
novel ASR personalization method based on Bayesian Low-rank Adaptation for
data-efficient fine-tuning. We validate our method on the English UA-Speech
dataset and a newly collected German speech dataset, BF-Sprache, from a child
with structural speech impairment. The dataset and approach are designed to
reflect the challenges of low-resource settings that include individuals with
speech impairments. Our method significantly improves ASR accuracy for impaired
speech while maintaining data and annotation efficiency, offering a practical
path toward inclusive ASR.

*Ismail Rasim Ulgen,Zongyang Du,Junchen Lu,Philipp Koehn,Berrak Sisman*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper introduces TTScore, a novel, reference-free evaluation framework for assessing intelligibility and prosody of synthesized speech. It outperforms existing metrics by showing strong alignment with human evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current speech evaluation metrics fail to comprehensively and accurately assess intelligibility and prosody, as they are either too narrow (e.g., pitch-based) or only weakly correlated with human perceptions.

Method: The study proposes TTScore, which includes two predictors: TTScore-int for intelligibility using content tokens, and TTScore-pro for prosody using prosody tokens. These predictors compute likelihood scores based on conditional prediction of discrete speech tokens without requiring reference signals.

Result: Experiments on established benchmarks (SOMOS, VoiceMOS, TTSArena) show that TTScore-int and TTScore-pro achieve better correlation with human judgments and provide targeted, interpretable evaluations for synthesized speech.

Conclusion: TTScore advances the evaluation of speech synthesis by providing a more reliable, interpretable, and human-aligned approach for assessing intelligibility (via TTScore-int) and prosody (via TTScore-pro).

Abstract: Objective evaluation of synthesized speech is critical for advancing speech
generation systems, yet existing metrics for intelligibility and prosody remain
limited in scope and weakly correlated with human perception. Word Error Rate
(WER) provides only a coarse text-based measure of intelligibility, while
F0-RMSE and related pitch-based metrics offer a narrow, reference-dependent
view of prosody. To address these limitations, we propose TTScore, a targeted
and reference-free evaluation framework based on conditional prediction of
discrete speech tokens. TTScore employs two sequence-to-sequence predictors
conditioned on input text: TTScore-int, which measures intelligibility through
content tokens, and TTScore-pro, which evaluates prosody through prosody
tokens. For each synthesized utterance, the predictors compute the likelihood
of the corresponding token sequences, yielding interpretable scores that
capture alignment with intended linguistic content and prosodic structure.
Experiments on the SOMOS, VoiceMOS, and TTSArena benchmarks demonstrate that
TTScore-int and TTScore-pro provide reliable, aspect-specific evaluation and
achieve stronger correlations with human judgments of overall quality than
existing intelligibility and prosody-focused metrics.

TL;DR: This paper introduces RAVEN, a real-time audio-visual speech enhancement system using CPU, that incorporates pretrained visual embeddings to improve speech clarity in noisy settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a robust, real-time speech enhancement system that effectively uses visual cues to improve clarity in diverse noise conditions, while operating on accessible hardware like CPUs.

Method: RAVEN leverages pretrained visual embeddings from an audio-visual speech recognition model to incorporate lip movement information for enhancing speech in various noisy environments.

Result: The system effectively generalizes across varying noise types, including environmental noise, interfering speakers, transient sounds, and even singing voices, providing real-time clean speech enhancement.

Conclusion: RAVEN demonstrates the feasibility of CPU-based real-time audio-visual speech enhancement systems and offers a tangible experience of robust speech enhancement using visual cues.

Abstract: We present a live demonstration for RAVEN, a real-time audio-visual speech
enhancement system designed to run entirely on a CPU. In single-channel,
audio-only settings, speech enhancement is traditionally approached as the task
of extracting clean speech from environmental noise. More recent work has
explored the use of visual cues, such as lip movements, to improve robustness,
particularly in the presence of interfering speakers. However, to our
knowledge, no prior work has demonstrated an interactive system for real-time
audio-visual speech enhancement operating on CPU hardware. RAVEN fills this gap
by using pretrained visual embeddings from an audio-visual speech recognition
model to encode lip movement information. The system generalizes across
environmental noise, interfering speakers, transient sounds, and even singing
voices. In this demonstration, attendees will be able to experience live
audio-visual target speech enhancement using a microphone and webcam setup,
with clean speech playback through headphones.

*Rostislav Makarov,Lea Schönherr,Timo Gerkmann*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: Advanced speech enhancement models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can semantically alter the enhanced output. However, diffusion models exhibit robustness against these manipulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the susceptibility of advanced speech enhancement models to adversarial attacks, particularly focusing on how these attacks can drastically alter the semantic meaning of the output.

Method: The study demonstrates the injection of psychoacoustically masked adversarial noise into input signals and analyzes the manipulability of predictive speech enhancement models. It also evaluates the robustness of diffusion models with stochastic samplers against such attacks.

Result: Experimental results confirm that contemporary predictive speech enhancement models can be manipulated through adversarial noise. In contrast, diffusion models inherently resist these attacks.

Conclusion: Speech enhancement models must consider vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks. Diffusion models provide a promising direction for designing robust systems that mitigate such security concerns.

Abstract: Machine learning approaches for speech enhancement are becoming increasingly
expressive, enabling ever more powerful modifications of input signals. In this
paper, we demonstrate that this expressiveness introduces a vulnerability:
advanced speech enhancement models can be susceptible to adversarial attacks.
Specifically, we show that adversarial noise, carefully crafted and
psychoacoustically masked by the original input, can be injected such that the
enhanced speech output conveys an entirely different semantic meaning. We
experimentally verify that contemporary predictive speech enhancement models
can indeed be manipulated in this way. Furthermore, we highlight that diffusion
models with stochastic samplers exhibit inherent robustness to such adversarial
attacks by design.

TL;DR: This paper presents CHOIR, an LLM-based chatbot designed to enhance organizational memory in research labs through document-grounded Q&A, knowledge extraction, and AI-assisted document updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Research labs struggle with retaining valuable knowledge from chat-based communication due to challenges with documentation maintenance and usability.

Method: The authors conducted formative interviews to identify problems, then designed and deployed CHOIR in four research labs (n=21) for a month, analyzing its usage and impact.

Result: Over a month, lab members asked 107 questions, and 38 document updates were made. Privacy concerns and reluctance to contribute broadly were key findings.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of balancing privacy with documentation visibility, and it provides design insights for improving context-specific knowledge documentation.

Abstract: University research labs often rely on chat-based platforms for communication
and project management, where valuable knowledge surfaces but is easily lost in
message streams. Documentation can preserve knowledge, but it requires ongoing
maintenance and is challenging to navigate. Drawing on formative interviews
that revealed organizational memory challenges in labs, we designed CHOIR, an
LLM-based chatbot that supports organizational memory through four key
functions: document-grounded Q&A, Q&A sharing for follow-up discussion,
knowledge extraction from conversations, and AI-assisted document updates. We
deployed CHOIR in four research labs for one month (n=21), where the lab
members asked 107 questions and lab directors updated documents 38 times in the
organizational memory. Our findings reveal a privacy-awareness tension:
questions were asked privately, limiting directors' visibility into
documentation gaps. Students often avoided contribution due to challenges in
generalizing personal experiences into universal documentation. We contribute
design implications for privacy-preserving awareness and supporting
context-specific knowledge documentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how users can effectively steer, control, and critically evaluate collaboration among multiple domain-expert agents in multi-agent systems.

Method: Implementation of Perspectra, a forum-style MAS platform with features like thread-based exploration, @-mentioning, and real-time visual mind mapping; followed by a within-subjects study with 18 participants, comparing Perspectra to a group-chat baseline during research proposal development.

Result: Using Perspectra resulted in significantly higher critical-thinking behaviors, more interdisciplinary interactions, and more frequent research proposal revisions compared to the baseline group-chat setting.

Conclusion: Perspectra facilitates critical thinking by providing users with structure and control in adversarial multi-agent discourse, suggesting design principles for future multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-agent systems (MAS) enable tools for information
search and ideation by assigning personas to agents. However, how users can
effectively control, steer, and critically evaluate collaboration among
multiple domain-expert agents remains underexplored. We present Perspectra, an
interactive MAS that visualizes and structures deliberation among LLM agents
via a forum-style interface, supporting @-mention to invite targeted agents,
threading for parallel exploration, with a real-time mind map for visualizing
arguments and rationales. In a within-subjects study with 18 participants, we
compared Perspectra to a group-chat baseline as they developed research
proposals. Our findings show that Perspectra significantly increased the
frequency and depth of critical-thinking behaviors, elicited more
interdisciplinary replies, and led to more frequent proposal revisions than the
group chat condition. We discuss implications for designing multi-agent tools
that scaffold critical thinking by supporting user control over multi-agent
adversarial discourse.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MechStyle, which utilizes Generative AI with Finite Element Analysis (FEA) feedback to stylize 3D printable models while preserving their structural integrity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Generative AI methods for 3D model stylization can compromise structural integrity, particularly when used for 3D printed objects.

Method: MechStyle integrates Generative AI with FEA simulation feedback to minimize stress-induced changes during the stylization process. It evaluates stylization control and adaptive scheduling strategies.

Result: The system effectively balances stylization and structural integrity, achieving promising results across different strategies and demonstrating time efficiency.

Conclusion: MechStyle offers a user-friendly solution for stylizing 3D printable models while ensuring they remain structurally sound after fabrication.

Abstract: Recent developments in Generative AI enable creators to stylize 3D models
based on text prompts. These methods change the 3D model geometry, which can
compromise the model's structural integrity once fabricated. We present
MechStyle, a system that enables creators to stylize 3D printable models while
preserving their structural integrity. MechStyle accomplishes this by
augmenting the Generative AI-based stylization process with feedback from a
Finite Element Analysis (FEA) simulation. As the stylization process modifies
the geometry to approximate the desired style, feedback from the FEA simulation
reduces modifications to regions with increased stress. We evaluate the
effectiveness of FEA simulation feedback in the augmented stylization process
by comparing three stylization control strategies. We also investigate the time
efficiency of our approach by comparing three adaptive scheduling strategies.
Finally, we demonstrate MechStyle's user interface that allows users to
generate stylized and structurally viable 3D models and provide five example

### [405] [Understanding Mode Switching in Human-AI Collaboration: Behavioral Insights and Predictive Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20666)

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper studies how humans dynamically switch control levels between themselves and AI during decision-making tasks and proposes a model to predict these switches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand and improve human-AI collaboration systems by addressing dynamic shifts in user preferences for control levels within a task.

Method: Participants engaged in a chess-based task involving two modes of interaction with AI. The study analyzed gaze patterns, emotional state, task difficulty, and quality of moves after control switches. A lightweight predictive model was trained using behavioral and task-specific data.

Result: Key behavioral differences and task complexities were identified preceding control switches. The model achieved an F1 score of 0.65 in predicting these switches using real-time behavioral inputs.

Conclusion: Integrating real-time behavioral signals can enhance shared autonomy systems, enabling dynamic and user-aligned control shifts within tasks.

Abstract: Human-AI collaboration is typically offered in one of two of user control
levels: guidance, where the AI provides suggestions and the human makes the
final decision, and delegation, where the AI acts autonomously within
user-defined constraints. Systems that integrate both modes, common in robotic
surgery or driving assistance, often overlook shifts in user preferences within
a task in response to factors like evolving trust, decision complexity, and
perceived control. In this work, we investigate how users dynamically switch
between higher and lower levels of control during a sequential decision-making
task. Using a hand-and-brain chess setup, participants either selected a piece
and the AI decided how it moved (brain mode), or the AI selected a piece and
the participant decided how it moved (hand mode). We collected over 400
mode-switching decisions from eight participants, along with gaze, emotional
state, and subtask difficulty data. Statistical analysis revealed significant
differences in gaze patterns and subtask complexity prior to a switch and in
the quality of the subsequent move. Based on these results, we engineered
behavioral and task-specific features to train a lightweight model that
predicted control level switches ($F1 = 0.65$). The model performance suggests
that real-time behavioral signals can serve as a complementary input alongside
system-driven mode-switching mechanisms currently used. We complement our
quantitative results with qualitative factors that influence switching
including perceived AI ability, decision complexity, and level of control,
identified from post-game interview analysis. The combined behavioral and
modeling insights can help inform the design of shared autonomy systems that
need dynamic, subtask-level control switches aligned with user intent and
evolving task demands.

TL;DR: This paper explores how professional designers perceive and engage with agentic AI systems, which autonomously support creative tasks. By employing design fiction, it identifies roles, authority dynamics, and communication within collaborative workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand the potential of agentic AI systems to assist designers by automating mundane tasks, thereby allowing designers to focus on creativity.

Method: Ten professional designers collaborated in a design fiction study, imagining interactions with agentic AI platforms to organize inspiration sources and ideate, exploring user preferences and interactions.

Result: Findings reveal roles AI can undertake to assist designers, preferred authority distribution between humans and AI, and strategies for conveying designers' intentions to AI beyond simple prompts.

Conclusion: A conceptual framework is proposed outlining human-AI roles and dynamics, offering insights for implementing agentic AI in future design workflows.

Abstract: As designers become familiar with Generative AI, a new concept is emerging:
Agentic AI. While generative AI produces output in response to prompts, agentic
AI systems promise to perform mundane tasks autonomously, potentially freeing
designers to focus on what they love: being creative. But how do designers feel
about integrating agentic AI systems into their workflows? Through design
fiction, we investigated how designers want to interact with a collaborative
agentic AI platform. Ten professional designers imagined and discussed
collaborating with an AI agent to organise inspiration sources and ideate. Our
findings highlight the roles AI agents can play in supporting designers, the
division of authority between humans and AI, and how designers' intent can be
explained to AI agents beyond prompts. We synthesise our findings into a
conceptual framework that identifies authority distribution among humans and AI
agents and discuss directions for utilising AI agents in future design
workflows.

TL;DR: The paper investigates AI-driven VTubers, focusing on Neuro-sama and analyzing audience perceptions to understand their impact on digital streaming culture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional VTubers rely on human operators, posing risks like personal controversies and operational disruptions. AI-driven VTubers overcome these issues but raise concerns about authenticity and engagement.

Method: The study conducts a case analysis of Neuro-sama, examining 108k Reddit posts and 136k YouTube comments to understand viewer perceptions of AI-driven VTubers.

Result: The findings reveal insights into viewer motivations, AI's construction of virtual personas, and audience perceptions of AI as operators.

Conclusion: AI-driven VTubers facilitate continuous operation and reduced risk of scandals, but challenges with authenticity and engagement remain, impacting the future of digital streaming culture.

Abstract: VTubers, digital personas represented by animated avatars, have gained
massive popularity. Traditionally, VTubers are operated and voiced by human
controllers known as Nakanohito. The reliance on Nakanohito, however, poses
risks due to potential personal controversies and operational disruptions. The
emergence of AI-driven VTubers offers a new model free from these human
constraints. While AI-driven VTubers present benefits such as continuous
operation and reduced scandal risk, they also raise questions about
authenticity and audience engagement. Therefore, to gain deeper insights, we
conduct a case study, investigating viewer perceptions of Neuro-sama, the most
popular AI-driven VTuber with 845k followers on Twitch and 753k followers on
YouTube. We analyze 108k Reddit posts and 136k YouTube comments, aiming to
better understand viewer motivations, how AI constructs the virtual persona,
and perceptions of the AI as Nakanohito. Our findings enhance the understanding

### [408] [Adoption, usability and perceived clinical value of a UK AI clinical reference platform (iatroX): a mixed-methods formative evaluation of real-world usage and a 1,223-respondent user survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21188)
*Kolawole Tytler*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: iatroX is a UK-focused platform using retrieval-augmented generation with large language models to provide clinical guidance. Early adoption shows promising usability, but future validation is needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinicians are increasingly burdened by information overload, which obstructs evidence-based medical care. This paper investigates the potential of retrieval-augmented generation to provide rapid and reliable clinical guidance.

Method: The evaluation involved a retrospective analysis of usage data from web and mobile platforms over 16 weeks, combined with a randomized in-product survey. Both quantitative metrics and thematic analysis were utilized.

Result: iatroX garnered over 19,000 unique web users and handled approximately 40,000 clinical queries. Surveys revealed high perceived usefulness (86.2%) and reliability (79.4%), with thematic insights emphasizing speed and guideline-linked answers.

Conclusion: Initial results indicate that iatroX aids clinicians in managing information overload effectively. However, limitations like small survey samples and early-adopter bias warrant further studies on its accuracy and integration into clinical workflows.

Abstract: Clinicians face growing information overload from biomedical literature and
guidelines, hindering evidence-based care. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
with large language models may provide fast, provenance-linked answers, but
requires real-world evaluation. We describe iatroX, a UK-centred RAG-based
clinical reference platform, and report early adoption, usability, and
perceived clinical value from a formative implementation evaluation. Methods
comprised a retrospective analysis of usage across web, iOS, and Android over
16 weeks (8 April-31 July 2025) and an in-product intercept survey. Usage
metrics were drawn from web and app analytics with bot filtering. A client-side
script randomized single-item prompts to approx. 10% of web sessions from a
predefined battery assessing usefulness, reliability, and adoption intent.
Proportions were summarized with Wilson 95% confidence intervals; free-text
comments underwent thematic content analysis. iatroX reached 19,269 unique web
users, 202,660 engagement events, and approx. 40,000 clinical queries. Mobile
uptake included 1,960 iOS downloads and Android growth (peak >750 daily active
users). The survey yielded 1,223 item-level responses: perceived usefulness
86.2% (95% CI 74.8-93.9%; 50/58); would use again 93.3% (95% CI 68.1-99.8%;
14/15); recommend to a colleague 88.4% (95% CI 75.1-95.9%; 38/43); perceived
accuracy 75.0% (95% CI 58.8-87.3%; 30/40); reliability 79.4% (95% CI
62.1-91.3%; 27/34). Themes highlighted speed, guideline-linked answers, and UK
specificity. Early real-world use suggests iatroX can mitigate information
overload and support timely answers for UK clinicians. Limitations include
small per-item samples and early-adopter bias; future work will include
accuracy audits and prospective studies on workflow and care quality.

*Hongqian Niu,Jordan Bryan,Xihao Li,Didong Li*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework to generate variant-level embeddings for the human genome using large language models, enabling structured genomic representation and downstream applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current applications of large language model embeddings largely focus on gene-level information, missing opportunities to address genomic variability at the variant level.

Method: Semantic text descriptions for 8.9 billion genomic variants were created using annotations from FAVOR, ClinVar, and the GWAS Catalog. LLM embeddings were generated using OpenAI's and Qwen's embedding models across three variant resolution scales.

Result: The generated embeddings demonstrated high predictive accuracy for variant properties, validating their usefulness. Applications include augmented genetic risk prediction and embedding-informed hypothesis testing.

Conclusion: Publicly available embeddings offer a robust resource for genomic analysis and precision medicine, supporting large-scale genomic discovery and risk prediction.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) embeddings have enabled
powerful representations for biological data, but most applications to date
focus only on gene-level information. We present one of the first systematic
frameworks to generate variant-level embeddings across the entire human genome.
Using curated annotations from FAVOR, ClinVar, and the GWAS Catalog, we
constructed semantic text descriptions for 8.9 billion possible variants and
generated embeddings at three scales: 1.5 million HapMap3+MEGA variants, ~90
million imputed UK Biobank variants, and ~9 billion all possible variants.
Embeddings were produced with both OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large and the
open-source Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B models. Baseline experiments demonstrate high
predictive accuracy for variant properties, validating the embeddings as
structured representations of genomic variation. We outline two downstream
applications: embedding-informed hypothesis testing by extending the
Frequentist And Bayesian framework to genome-wide association studies, and
embedding-augmented genetic risk prediction that enhances standard polygenic
risk scores. These resources, publicly available on Hugging Face, provide a
foundation for advancing large-scale genomic discovery and precision medicine.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a convolutional U-Net model for liquid metal dealloying that accelerates simulations by up to 16,000 times while maintaining high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational intractability of phase-field models of liquid metal dealloying for large domains or long time horizons.

Method: The paper introduces a conditionally parameterized U-Net with convolutional self-attention, physics-aware padding, and parameter conditioning for adaptable time-step skipping and alloy diversity.

Result: The model achieves less than 5% error within training regimes and below 10% error in extrapolated scenarios, extending predictions and reducing weeks of computation to seconds.

Conclusion: The method represents a significant advancement in scalable and high-fidelity simulation of LMD phase-field models, enabling generalized, efficient computations.

Abstract: Phase-field models of liquid metal dealloying (LMD) can resolve rich
microstructural dynamics but become intractable for large domains or long time
horizons. We present a conditionally parameterized, fully convolutional U-Net
surrogate that generalizes far beyond its training window in both space and
time. The design integrates convolutional self-attention and physics-aware
padding, while parameter conditioning enables variable time-step skipping and
adaptation to diverse alloy systems. Although trained only on short,
small-scale simulations, the surrogate exploits the translational invariance of
convolutions to extend predictions to much longer horizons than traditional
solvers. It accurately reproduces key LMD physics, with relative errors
typically under 5% within the training regime and below 10% when extrapolating
to larger domains and later times. The method accelerates computations by up to
16,000 times, cutting weeks of simulation down to seconds, and marks an early
step toward scalable, high-fidelity extrapolation of LMD phase-field models.

TL;DR: The paper investigates Concept-Based In-Context Learning (CB-ICL), providing theoretical insights for its performance in label prediction with sparse demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited theoretical understanding of how In-Context Learning (ICL) works in the context of natural language processing and applications of large language models.

Method: Theoretical analyses based on CB-ICL are developed to quantify knowledge transfer in ICL, define similarity measures for prompt engineering, and evaluate performance under various settings.

Result: Theoretical insights detail why and when CB-ICL performs effectively. Experiments validate the practical benefits of CB-ICL and its associated theoretical framework.

Conclusion: The findings explain CB-ICL dynamics, offer guidelines for model pre-training and prompt engineering, and explore key factors affecting ICL performance such as demonstration size and embedding dimensions.

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has emerged as an important new paradigm in natural
language processing and large language model (LLM) applications. However, the
theoretical understanding of the ICL mechanism remains limited. This paper aims
to investigate this issue by studying a particular ICL approach, called
concept-based ICL (CB-ICL). In particular, we propose theoretical analyses on
applying CB-ICL to ICL tasks, which explains why and when the CB-ICL performs
well for predicting query labels in prompts with only a few demonstrations. In
addition, the proposed theory quantifies the knowledge that can be leveraged by
the LLMs to the prompt tasks, and leads to a similarity measure between the
prompt demonstrations and the query input, which provides important insights
and guidance for model pre-training and prompt engineering in ICL. Moreover,
the impact of the prompt demonstration size and the dimension of the LLM
embeddings in ICL are also explored based on the proposed theory. Finally,
several real-data experiments are conducted to validate the practical
usefulness of CB-ICL and the corresponding theory.

*Benedikt Hoock,Tobias Köppl*

TL;DR: The paper introduces a neural network-based method for calibrating Windkessel (WK) parameters in a coupled 1D-0D blood flow model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve the calibration of WK parameters for better modeling of blood flow, especially in noisy or uncertain measurement conditions.

Method: A neural network trained on simulated blood pressure data from the left brachial artery is used to emulate pressure pulse waves, and calibration is achieved by retraining dummy neurons on measured wave parameters.

Result: The proposed method is effective in handling various scenarios, including unknown measurement locations and noisy data.

Conclusion: The neural network-based approach demonstrates negligible error, low computational effort, and robustness in calibrating WK parameters under challenging conditions.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel method for calibrating Windkessel (WK)
parameters in a dimensionally reduced 1D-0D coupled blood flow model. To this
end, we design a data-driven neural network (NN)trained on simulated blood
pressures in the left brachial artery. Once trained, the NN emulates the
pressure pulse waves across the entire simulated domain, i.e., over time, space
and varying WK parameters, with negligible error and computational effort. To
calibrate the WK parameters on a measured pulse wave, the NN is extended by
dummy neurons and retrained only on these. The main objective of this work is
to assess the effectiveness of the method in various scenarios -- particularly,
when the exact measurement location is unknown or the data are affected by
noise.

*Chi-Shian Dai,Chao Ying,Yang Ning,Jiwei Zhao*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper addresses inefficiencies in using external controls within the doubly robust estimator for ATT and proposes a new estimator that ensures improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Incorporating external control data in ATT estimation can reduce efficiency, contradicting its intuitive benefits, necessitating a more effective approach.

Method: A novel doubly robust estimator is proposed that guarantees higher efficiency, even under model misspecification, while aligning with semiparametric efficiency when all models are correctly specified.

Result: The developed estimator improves efficiency over standard approaches, supports high-dimensional confounder settings, and is validated through simulations and real-world data.

Conclusion: The proposed estimator resolves inefficiencies in using external controls, offering robust performance even with model misspecification and high-dimensional data.

Abstract: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are widely regarded as the gold standard
for causal inference in biomedical research. For instance, when estimating the
average treatment effect on the treated (ATT), a doubly robust estimation
procedure can be applied, requiring either the propensity score model or the
control outcome model to be correctly specified. In this paper, we address
scenarios where external control data, often with a much larger sample size,
are available. Such data are typically easier to obtain from historical records
or third-party sources. However, we find that incorporating external controls
into the standard doubly robust estimator for ATT may paradoxically result in
reduced efficiency compared to using the estimator without external controls.
This counterintuitive outcome suggests that the naive incorporation of external
controls could be detrimental to estimation efficiency. To resolve this issue,
we propose a novel doubly robust estimator that guarantees higher efficiency
than the standard approach without external controls, even under model
misspecification. When all models are correctly specified, this estimator
aligns with the standard doubly robust estimator that incorporates external
controls and achieves semiparametric efficiency. The asymptotic theory
developed in this work applies to high-dimensional confounder settings, which
are increasingly common with the growing prevalence of electronic health record
data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology through extensive
simulation studies and a real-world data application.

*Hadley Black,Kasper Green Larsen,Arya Mazumdar,Barna Saha,Geelon So*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: The paper addresses the point location problem in machine learning, focusing on efficient algorithms for learning halfspaces without relying on point synthesis. It improves query bounds for both deterministic learning and PAC-learning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing algorithms for learning halfspaces often rely on point synthesis, which limits practical applicability due to a high query lower bound without it. The study aims to overcome these limitations by focusing on structured normal vectors.

Method: The authors propose efficient algorithms leveraging structural ordering to perform binary searches in parallel. They explore learning a Boolean function monotone under selected orderings and extend the approach to PAC-learning in adversarial settings.

Result: The proposed algorithm achieves tight bounds of Θ(D + log n) for deterministic learning and nearly optimal query complexity of O(min(D + log(1/ε), 1/ε) · log D) for PAC-learning, even under adversarial corruption.

Conclusion: This work closes the gap in query complexity for axis-aligned halfspaces and offers a broader technical insight for binary search in parallel, advancing deterministic learner algorithms and PAC-learning methodologies.

Abstract: In the classic point location problem, one is given an arbitrary dataset $X
\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ of $n$ points with query access to an unknown halfspace
$f : \mathbb{R}^d \to \{0,1\}$, and the goal is to learn the label of every
point in $X$. This problem is extremely well-studied and a nearly-optimal
$\widetilde{O}(d \log n)$ query algorithm is known due to
Hopkins-Kane-Lovett-Mahajan (FOCS 2020). However, their algorithm is granted
the power to query arbitrary points outside of $X$ (point synthesis), and in
fact without this power there is an $\Omega(n)$ query lower bound due to
Dasgupta (NeurIPS 2004).
  In this work our goal is to design efficient algorithms for learning
halfspaces without point synthesis. To circumvent the $\Omega(n)$ lower bound,
we consider learning halfspaces whose normal vectors come from a set of size
$D$, and show tight bounds of $\Theta(D + \log n)$. As a corollary, we obtain
an optimal $O(d + \log n)$ query deterministic learner for axis-aligned
halfspaces, closing a previous gap of $O(d \log n)$ vs. $\Omega(d + \log n)$.
In fact, our algorithm solves the more general problem of learning a Boolean
function $f$ over $n$ elements which is monotone under at least one of $D$
provided orderings. Our technical insight is to exploit the structure in these
orderings to perform a binary search in parallel rather than considering each
ordering sequentially, and we believe our approach may be of broader interest.
  Furthermore, we use our exact learning algorithm to obtain nearly optimal
algorithms for PAC-learning. We show that $O(\min(D + \log(1/\varepsilon),
1/\varepsilon) \cdot \log D)$ queries suffice to learn $f$ within error
$\varepsilon$, even in a setting when $f$ can be adversarially corrupted on a
$c\varepsilon$-fraction of points, for a sufficiently small constant $c$. This
bound is optimal up to a $\log D$ factor, including in the realizable setting.

Motivation: To understand the geometric properties of maxout polytopes generated by neural networks and their influence on network layers and activation.

Method: The authors characterized parameter spaces, f-vectors, separating hypersurfaces, and geometric structures of maxout polytopes in neural networks with maxout activation.

Result: The study revealed that maxout polytopes exhibit specific properties, such as being cubical in networks without bottlenecks, and further detailed their geometric aspects.

Conclusion: The research provides insights into the geometric and structural behavior of maxout polytopes, enhancing the understanding of their role in neural network computations.

Abstract: Maxout polytopes are defined by feedforward neural networks with maxout
activation function and non-negative weights after the first layer. We
characterize the parameter spaces and extremal f-vectors of maxout polytopes
for shallow networks, and we study the separating hypersurfaces which arise
when a layer is added to the network. We also show that maxout polytopes are

TL;DR: The study explores Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) as a novel method to model two-dimensional hydrodynamics of accretion disks, demonstrating accurate and spurious-reflection-free solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional computational methods for modeling accretion disks are intensive and often encounter challenges like spurious wave reflection. A more efficient and boundary-free approach is highly desired.

Method: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are trained using physical laws without relying on data, applied here to solve time-dependent hydrodynamics of non-self-gravitating accretion disks in two dimensions.

Result: The study demonstrates successful reproduction of key physical phenomena such as spiral density waves and gap formation while avoiding spurious wave reflections.

Conclusion: PINNs offer a promising, efficient, and data-free alternative to traditional numerical simulations for modeling complex astrophysical systems.

Abstract: Accretion disks are ubiquitous in astrophysics, appearing in diverse
environments from planet-forming systems to X-ray binaries and active galactic
nuclei. Traditionally, modeling their dynamics requires computationally
intensive (magneto)hydrodynamic simulations. Recently, Physics-Informed Neural
Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising alternative. This approach trains
neural networks directly on physical laws without requiring data. We for the
first time demonstrate PINNs for solving the two-dimensional, time-dependent
hydrodynamics of non-self-gravitating accretion disks. Our models provide
solutions at arbitrary times and locations within the training domain, and
successfully reproduce key physical phenomena, including the excitation and
propagation of spiral density waves and gap formation from disk-companion
interactions. Notably, the boundary-free approach enabled by PINNs naturally
eliminates the spurious wave reflections at disk edges, which are challenging
to suppress in numerical simulations. These results highlight how advanced
machine learning techniques can enable physics-driven, data-free modeling of
complex astrophysical systems, potentially offering an alternative to
traditional numerical simulations in the future.

TL;DR: This paper studies how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can naturally respect rotational symmetry when learning to super-resolve turbulent flows without explicit augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high computational cost of simulating turbulence motivates the use of machine learning. However, ensuring that learned models respect physical symmetries like rotational equivariance is challenging.

Method: The authors investigate how turbulence itself provides implicit rotational augmentation. They test CNNs trained on 3D turbulent flow subdomains, varying data anisotropy and temporal/spatial sampling.

Result: Models trained on isotropic mid-plane data exhibit lower equivariance error than boundary layer data. Increased temporal or spatial sampling further reduces equivariance error, with a scale-dependence aligning with Kolmogorov's local isotropy hypothesis.

Conclusion: The paper finds conditions under which rotational symmetry in turbulence can be exploited naturally, reducing the need for explicit symmetry incorporation in machine learning models for turbulence.

Abstract: The immense computational cost of simulating turbulence has motivated the use
of machine learning approaches for super-resolving turbulent flows. A central
challenge is ensuring that learned models respect physical symmetries, such as
rotational equivariance. We show that standard convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) can partially acquire this symmetry without explicit augmentation or
specialized architectures, as turbulence itself provides implicit rotational
augmentation in both time and space. Using 3D channel-flow subdomains with
differing anisotropy, we find that models trained on more isotropic mid-plane
data achieve lower equivariance error than those trained on boundary layer
data, and that greater temporal or spatial sampling further reduces this error.
We show a distinct scale-dependence of equivariance error that occurs
regardless of dataset anisotropy that is consistent with Kolmogorov's local
isotropy hypothesis. These results clarify when rotational symmetry must be
explicitly incorporated into learning algorithms and when it can be obtained
directly from turbulence, enabling more efficient and symmetry-aware
super-resolution.

*Jiakai Tang,Yujie Luo,Xunke Xi,Fei Sun,Xueyang Feng,Sunhao Dai,Chao Yi,Dian Chen,Zhujin Gao,Yang Li,Xu Chen,Wen Chen,Jian Wu,Yuning Jiang,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Interactive Recommendation Feed (IRF), a novel system allowing users to use natural language commands for personalized recommendations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional recommender systems cannot capture nuanced user preferences, leading to a gap between user intentions and system output.

Method: The researchers design RecBot, featuring a Parser Agent for processing user commands and a Planner Agent for real-time policy adjustments, augmented by knowledge distillation.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate notable improvements in user satisfaction and business metrics with RecBot.

Conclusion: Interactive linguistic control in recommender systems bridges gaps in preference modeling and enhances user enjoyment and system effectiveness.

Abstract: Traditional recommender systems rely on passive feedback mechanisms that
limit users to simple choices such as like and dislike. However, these
coarse-grained signals fail to capture users' nuanced behavior motivations and
intentions. In turn, current systems cannot also distinguish which specific
item attributes drive user satisfaction or dissatisfaction, resulting in
inaccurate preference modeling. These fundamental limitations create a
persistent gap between user intentions and system interpretations, ultimately
undermining user satisfaction and harming system effectiveness.
  To address these limitations, we introduce the Interactive Recommendation
Feed (IRF), a pioneering paradigm that enables natural language commands within
mainstream recommendation feeds. Unlike traditional systems that confine users
to passive implicit behavioral influence, IRF empowers active explicit control
over recommendation policies through real-time linguistic commands. To support
this paradigm, we develop RecBot, a dual-agent architecture where a Parser
Agent transforms linguistic expressions into structured preferences and a
Planner Agent dynamically orchestrates adaptive tool chains for on-the-fly
policy adjustment. To enable practical deployment, we employ
simulation-augmented knowledge distillation to achieve efficient performance
while maintaining strong reasoning capabilities. Through extensive offline and
long-term online experiments, RecBot shows significant improvements in both
user satisfaction and business outcomes.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper proposes a system using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and vision-language models (VLMs) for analyzing archaeological artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To alleviate the cognitive burden on experts in analyzing vast corpora of archaeological artifacts, specifically for provenance analysis.

Method: The system integrates multimodal retrieval and large vision-language models, constructing a dual-modal knowledge base from text and images for structured and interpretable inferences.

Result: The system effectively analyzes Eastern Eurasian Bronze Age artifacts, offering meaningful insights and starting points for expert research.

Conclusion: The system reduces expert cognitive load through structured outputs and provides interpretable analyses, proving to be a valuable tool for archaeological research.

Abstract: In this work, we present a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based system
for provenance analysis of archaeological artifacts, designed to support expert
reasoning by integrating multimodal retrieval and large vision-language models
(VLMs). The system constructs a dual-modal knowledge base from reference texts
and images, enabling raw visual, edge-enhanced, and semantic retrieval to
identify stylistically similar objects. Retrieved candidates are synthesized by
the VLM to generate structured inferences, including chronological,
geographical, and cultural attributions, alongside interpretive justifications.
We evaluate the system on a set of Eastern Eurasian Bronze Age artifacts from
the British Museum. Expert evaluation demonstrates that the system produces
meaningful and interpretable outputs, offering scholars concrete starting
points for analysis and significantly alleviating the cognitive burden of
navigating vast comparative corpora.

### [421] [Rejuvenating Cross-Entropy Loss in Knowledge Distillation for Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20989)
*Zhangchi Zhu,Wei Zhang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper analyzes Cross-Entropy loss in knowledge distillation for recommender systems, presents its limitations in aligning with NDCG, and proposes an improved technique called RCE-KD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from understanding and improving how Cross-Entropy loss aligns to the goal of distilling ranking-based knowledge (NDCG) in recommendations, as current methods face theoretical limitations.

Method: The paper analyzes the connection between CE loss and NDCG, identifies the mismatch, and introduces RCE-KD, which splits teacher's top items and employs a collaborative sampling strategy for condition approximation.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that RCE-KD effectively bridges the gap between the theoretical limitations and practical goal of aligning with NDCG, outperforming baseline methods.

Conclusion: The proposed RCE-KD method overcomes the limitations of traditional CE loss in KD for recommender systems by addressing theoretical gaps and improving performance in practical settings.

Abstract: This paper analyzes Cross-Entropy (CE) loss in knowledge distillation (KD)
for recommender systems. KD for recommender systems targets at distilling
rankings, especially among items most likely to be preferred, and can only be
computed on a small subset of items. Considering these features, we reveal the
connection between CE loss and NDCG in the field of KD. We prove that when
performing KD on an item subset, minimizing CE loss maximizes the lower bound
of NDCG, only if an assumption of closure is satisfied. It requires that the
item subset consists of the student's top items. However, this contradicts our
goal of distilling rankings of the teacher's top items. We empirically
demonstrate the vast gap between these two kinds of top items. To bridge the
gap between our goal and theoretical support, we propose Rejuvenated
Cross-Entropy for Knowledge Distillation (RCE-KD). It splits the top items
given by the teacher into two subsets based on whether they are highly ranked
by the student. For the subset that defies the condition, a sampling strategy
is devised to use teacher-student collaboration to approximate our assumption
of closure. We also combine the losses on the two subsets adaptively. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our code is available
at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/RCE-KD.

### [422] [IntSR: An Integrated Generative Framework for Search and Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21179)
*Huimin Yan,Longfei Xu,Junjie Sun,Ni Ou,Wei Luo,Xing Tan,Ran Cheng,Kaikui Liu,Xiangxiang Chu*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces IntSR, a generative framework that integrates search and recommendation tasks by unifying distinct query modalities. It's successfully applied in real-world scenarios with notable performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing systems excel at unifying retrieval and ranking but overlook the integration of search (explicit queries) and recommendation (implicit queries). The paper addresses this gap.

Method: IntSR is a generative framework designed to integrate search and recommendation tasks by distinguishing query modalities and managing computational complexity and corpus dynamics.

Result: The IntSR framework, deployed in Amap, demonstrated significant enhancements in digital asset GMV (+3.02%), POI recommendation CTR (+2.76%), and travel mode suggestion accuracy (+5.13%).

Conclusion: IntSR effectively integrates search and recommendation tasks, proving its real-world efficacy and performance advancements in various applications.

Abstract: Generative recommendation has emerged as a promising paradigm, demonstrating
remarkable results in both academic benchmarks and industrial applications.
However, existing systems predominantly focus on unifying retrieval and ranking
while neglecting the integration of search and recommendation (S&R) tasks. What
makes search and recommendation different is how queries are formed: search
uses explicit user requests, while recommendation relies on implicit user
interests. As for retrieval versus ranking, the distinction comes down to
whether the queries are the target items themselves. Recognizing the query as
central element, we propose IntSR, an integrated generative framework for S&R.
IntSR integrates these disparate tasks using distinct query modalities. It also
addresses the increased computational complexity associated with integrated S&R
behaviors and the erroneous pattern learning introduced by a dynamically
changing corpus. IntSR has been successfully deployed across various scenarios
in Amap, leading to substantial improvements in digital asset's GMV(+3.02%),
POI recommendation's CTR(+2.76%), and travel mode suggestion's ACC(+5.13%).

### [423] [Visual Authority and the Rhetoric of Health Misinformation: A Multimodal Analysis of Social Media Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20724)
*Mohammad Reza Zarei,Barbara Stead-Coyle,Michael Christensen,Sarah Everts,Majid Komeili*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: This paper studies how credibility is conveyed in nutrition and supplement videos across TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube by analyzing authority signals, narrative strategies, and monetization methods using a multimodal corpus and annotation framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand how health narratives on short-form video platforms blend credible, misleading, and harmful information, focusing on how they use authority and persuasion to package credibility.

Method: The researchers created a cross-platform corpus of 152 videos, annotating them using 26 features related to visual authority, presenter traits, narrative techniques, and engagement cues, supported by multimodal modeling and human verification.

Result: Confident single presenters often dominate, using authority cues (titles, certificates, charts) alongside persuasion techniques (jargon, urgency, critiques of mainstream medicine), often linked to monetization tactics (sales links, subscriptions).

Conclusion: Authority and credibility in health narratives on short-form video platforms are often presented through a mix of scientific references and emotive/oppositional narratives, which prioritize persuasion over restraint.

Abstract: Short form video platforms are central sites for health advice, where
alternative narratives mix useful, misleading, and harmful content. Rather than
adjudicating truth, this study examines how credibility is packaged in
nutrition and supplement videos by analyzing the intersection of authority
signals, narrative techniques, and monetization. We assemble a cross platform
corpus of 152 public videos from TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube and annotate
each on 26 features spanning visual authority, presenter attributes, narrative
strategies, and engagement cues. A transparent annotation pipeline integrates
automatic speech recognition, principled frame selection, and a multimodal
model, with human verification on a stratified subsample showing strong
agreement. Descriptively, a confident single presenter in studio or home
settings dominates, and clinical contexts are rare. Analytically, authority
cues such as titles, slides and charts, and certificates frequently occur with
persuasive elements including jargon, references, fear or urgency, critiques of
mainstream medicine, and conspiracies, and with monetization including sales
links and calls to subscribe. References and science like visuals often travel
with emotive and oppositional narratives rather than signaling restraint.

### [424] [Identifying Group Anchors in Real-World Group Interactions Under Label Scarcity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20762)
*Fanchen Bu,Geon Lee,Minyoung Choe,Kijung Shin*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: This paper introduces the concept of 'group anchors,' individuals who play a pivotal role in forming groups, and proposes a semi-supervised method (AnchorRadar) for identifying them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of identifying key influential individuals in group interactions, especially in scenarios with limited labeled data.

Method: AnchorRadar is a semi-supervised method utilizing data from groups with and without known anchors, enabling efficient and accurate identification of group anchors.

Result: Extensive testing on thirteen datasets shows that AnchorRadar surpasses baselines in accuracy, efficiency, and resource efficiency.

Conclusion: AnchorRadar is a robust tool for group anchor identification, achieving better performance and faster training with fewer parameters compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Group interactions occur in various real-world contexts, e.g., co-authorship,
email communication, and online Q&A. In each group, there is often a
particularly significant member, around whom the group is formed. Examples
include the first or last author of a paper, the sender of an email, and the
questioner in a Q&A session. In this work, we discuss the existence of such
individuals in real-world group interactions. We call such individuals group
anchors and study the problem of identifying them. First, we introduce the
concept of group anchors and the identification problem. Then, we discuss our
observations on group anchors in real-world group interactions. Based on our
observations, we develop AnchorRadar, a fast and effective method for group
anchor identification under realistic settings with label scarcity, i.e., when
only a few groups have known anchors. AnchorRadar is a semi-supervised method
using information from groups both with and without known group anchors.
Finally, through extensive experiments on thirteen real-world datasets, we
demonstrate the empirical superiority of AnchorRadar over various baselines
w.r.t. accuracy and efficiency. In most cases, AnchorRadar achieves higher
accuracy in group anchor identification than all the baselines, while using
10.2$\times$ less training time than the fastest baseline and 43.6$\times$
fewer learnable parameters than the most lightweight baseline on average.

### [425] [Evading Overlapping Community Detection via Proxy Node Injection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21211)
*Dario Loi,Matteo Silvestri,Fabrizio Silvestri,Gabriele Tolomei*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: The paper tackles the challenge of preserving privacy in social graphs by hiding community memberships through edge modifications while maintaining the graph's topology. It introduces a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for overlapping communities, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social graphs often expose sensitive community information, risking privacy breaches. Existing solutions focus on non-overlapping communities, but real-world graphs typically contain overlapping communities where trivial techniques are ineffective.

Method: The authors employ a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach to learn optimal graph modification strategies, including utilizing proxy nodes, ensuring scalability and structural preservation.

Result: Experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed DRL method in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency compared to baseline approaches.

Conclusion: This paper provides a novel, efficient solution for privacy-preserving modifications in graphs with overlapping communities, setting a foundation for further advancements in privacy protection mechanisms in graph data.

Abstract: Protecting privacy in social graphs requires preventing sensitive
information, such as community affiliations, from being inferred by graph
analysis, without substantially altering the graph topology. We address this
through the problem of \emph{community membership hiding} (CMH), which seeks
edge modifications that cause a target node to exit its original community,
regardless of the detection algorithm employed. Prior work has focused on
non-overlapping community detection, where trivial strategies often suffice,
but real-world graphs are better modeled by overlapping communities, where such
strategies fail. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to formalize
and address CMH in this setting. In this work, we propose a deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) approach that learns effective modification policies, including
the use of proxy nodes, while preserving graph structure. Experiments on
real-world datasets show that our method significantly outperforms existing
baselines in both effectiveness and efficiency, offering a principled tool for
privacy-preserving graph modification with overlapping communities.

### [426] [Recidivism and Peer Influence with LLM Text Embeddings in Low Security Correctional Facilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20634)
*Shanjukta Nath,Jiwon Hong,Jae Ho Chang,Keith Warren,Subhadeep Paul*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: AI embeddings derived from written exchanges in low-security correctional facilities are found to be strong predictors of recidivism, outperforming pre-entry covariates. Peer effects in language usage are analyzed using newly developed methodologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance understanding and prediction of recidivism through language analysis, and to investigate social dynamics within correctional facilities.

Method: The study utilized embeddings generated from a transformer-based Large Language Model applied to textual data. These embeddings were analyzed using Zero-Shot classification and a multivariate peer effect model to understand language-based interactions and feedback.

Result: Embedding vectors improved prediction accuracy of recidivism by 30% compared to pre-entry covariates. Significant peer effects in language usage were also identified with adjusted modeling techniques.

Conclusion: Language usage, captured through AI embeddings and augmented with peer effect modeling, provides valuable insights into recidivism prediction and social dynamics in correctional facilities.

Abstract: We find AI embeddings obtained using a pre-trained transformer-based Large
Language Model (LLM) of 80,000-120,000 written affirmations and correction
exchanges among residents in low-security correctional facilities to be highly
predictive of recidivism. The prediction accuracy is 30\% higher with embedding
vectors than with only pre-entry covariates. However, since the text embedding
vectors are high-dimensional, we perform Zero-Shot classification of these
texts to a low-dimensional vector of user-defined classes to aid interpretation
while retaining the predictive power. To shed light on the social dynamics
inside the correctional facilities, we estimate peer effects in these
LLM-generated numerical representations of language with a multivariate peer
effect model, adjusting for network endogeneity. We develop new methodology and
theory for peer effect estimation that accommodate sparse networks,
multivariate latent variables, and correlated multivariate outcomes. With these
new methods, we find significant peer effects in language usage for interaction
and feedback.

*Duc-Tuan Truong,Tianchi Liu,Ruijie Tao,Junjie Li,Kong Aik Lee,Eng Siong Chng*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper proposes QAMO, a speech deepfake detection method using quality-aware multi-centroid learning, improving detection by addressing speech quality subspaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of single-centroid modeling in one-class learning for detecting unseen deepfake speech attacks, particularly by incorporating speech quality cues.

Method: QAMO introduces multiple quality-aware centroids to represent distinct speech quality subspaces and employs a multi-centroid ensemble scoring strategy for improved inference.

Result: QAMO achieves a significant improvement in speech deepfake detection, reducing the equal error rate to 5.09% on the In-the-Wild dataset.

Conclusion: QAMO demonstrates that modeling intra-class variability through quality-aware multi-centroids is an effective strategy for enhancing detection of unseen deepfake speech attacks.

Abstract: Recent work shows that one-class learning can detect unseen deepfake attacks
by modeling a compact distribution of bona fide speech around a single
centroid. However, the single-centroid assumption can oversimplify the bona
fide speech representation and overlook useful cues, such as speech quality,
which reflects the naturalness of the speech. Speech quality can be easily
obtained using existing speech quality assessment models that estimate it
through Mean Opinion Score. In this paper, we propose QAMO: Quality-Aware
Multi-Centroid One-Class Learning for speech deepfake detection. QAMO extends
conventional one-class learning by introducing multiple quality-aware
centroids. In QAMO, each centroid is optimized to represent a distinct speech
quality subspaces, enabling better modeling of intra-class variability in bona
fide speech. In addition, QAMO supports a multi-centroid ensemble scoring
strategy, which improves decision thresholding and reduces the need for quality
labels during inference. With two centroids to represent high- and low-quality
speech, our proposed QAMO achieves an equal error rate of 5.09% in In-the-Wild
dataset, outperforming previous one-class and quality-aware systems.

### [428] [Addressing Gradient Misalignment in Data-Augmented Training for Robust Speech Deepfake Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20682)
*Duc-Tuan Truong,Tianchi Liu,Junjie Li,Ruijie Tao,Kong Aik Lee,Eng Siong Chng*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper proposes a dual-path data augmentation framework with gradient alignment to address gradient conflicts in speech deepfake detection training, achieving faster convergence and improved detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data augmentation is widely used in speech deepfake detection to improve model generalization, but conflicting gradients between original and augmented inputs during training can hinder benefits.

Method: The dual-path framework processes each utterance through two paths for original and augmented speech, aligning the gradient directions to reduce optimization conflicts.

Result: The analysis shows 25% of training iterations experience gradient conflicts, and resolving these with alignment reduces training epochs and achieves up to 18.69% better Equal Error Rate on the In-the-Wild dataset.

Conclusion: Gradient alignment in the proposed framework accelerates convergence and enhances the effectiveness of data augmentation in speech deepfake detection.

Abstract: In speech deepfake detection (SDD), data augmentation (DA) is commonly used
to improve model generalization across varied speech conditions and spoofing
attacks. However, during training, the backpropagated gradients from original
and augmented inputs may misalign, which can result in conflicting parameter
updates. These conflicts could hinder convergence and push the model toward
suboptimal solutions, thereby reducing the benefits of DA. To investigate and
address this issue, we design a dual-path data-augmented (DPDA) training
framework with gradient alignment for SDD. In our framework, each training
utterance is processed through two input paths: one using the original speech
and the other with its augmented version. This design allows us to compare and
align their backpropagated gradient directions to reduce optimization
conflicts. Our analysis shows that approximately 25% of training iterations
exhibit gradient conflicts between the original inputs and their augmented
counterparts when using RawBoost augmentation. By resolving these conflicts
with gradient alignment, our method accelerates convergence by reducing the
number of training epochs and achieves up to an 18.69% relative reduction in
Equal Error Rate on the In-the-Wild dataset compared to the baseline.

TL;DR: The paper explores optimizing end-to-end voice-to-voice (V-2-V) communication systems for real-time applications by focusing on Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Text-to-Speech (TTS), and dialog management components, with key findings on TTS optimizations impacting latency and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance real-time conversational experiences by developing a faster and more efficient V-2-V communication system, while still delivering high-quality and natural voice interactions.

Method: The study analyzes the architecture components of V-2-V systems and experiments with optimizing the Text-to-Speech (TTS) module by adjusting Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) iterations and codebooks.

Result: The research finds that TTS optimization significantly affects the Real-Time Factor (RTF), and reducing RVQ iterations and codebooks in the TTS decoder can improve latency with manageable quality trade-offs.

Conclusion: Optimizing the TTS component is crucial to achieving lower processing times in V-2-V systems for real-time use cases, while maintaining voice quality suitable for conversational applications.

Abstract: We experiment with a low-latency, end-to-end voice-to-voice communication
model to optimize it for real-time conversational applications. By analyzing
components essential to voice to voice (V-2-V) system viz. automatic speech
recognition (ASR), text-to-speech (TTS), and dialog management, our work
analyzes how to reduce processing time while maintaining high-quality
interactions to identify the levers for optimizing V-2-V system. Our work
identifies that TTS component which generates life-like voice, full of emotions
including natural pauses and exclamations has highest impact on Real time
factor (RTF). The experimented V-2-V architecture utilizes CSM1b has the
capability to understand tone as well as context of conversation by ingesting
both audio and text of prior exchanges to generate contextually accurate
speech. We explored optimization of Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ)
iterations by the TTS decoder which come at a cost of decrease in the quality
of voice generated. Our experimental evaluations also demonstrate that for
V-2-V implementations based on CSM most important optimizations can be brought
by reducing the number of RVQ Iterations along with the codebooks used in Mimi.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces Support Vector Regularization (SVR), a method designed to improve multimodal contrastive learning by controlling optimization trajectory drift while retaining rich semantic information from negative samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal contrastive language-audio pretraining faces training instability due to unconstrained optimization caused by negative samples. The authors aim to stabilize and improve this process.

Method: The authors propose using auxiliary support vectors to regulate the perpendicular component from negative samples. They introduce modeling strategies, employing parameterization and adaptive radius predictors with constraints, to enhance semantic control.

Result: SVR outperforms popular baselines like InfoNCE and SigLIP across various classification and retrieval tasks using standard audio-text datasets.

Conclusion: SVR effectively mitigates optimization drift while harnessing rich information from negative samples, showcasing both theoretical and experimental validation of its superior performance.

Abstract: Contrastive language-audio pretraining, which aims to unify multimodal
representations in a shared embedding space, serves as a cornerstone for
building a wide range of applications, from cross-modal retrieval to
cutting-edge multimodal large language models. However, we find that the
perpendicular component of the pushing force from negative samples in
contrastive learning is a double-edged sword: it contains rich supplementary
information from negative samples, yet its unconstrained nature causes
optimization trajectory drift and training instability. To address this, we
propose Support Vector Regularization (SVR), a method that introduces an
auxiliary support vector to control this perpendicular component, aiming to
harness its rich information while mitigating the associated trajectory drift.
The efficacy of SVR is critically governed by its semantic radius, for which we
explore two unsupervised modeling strategies: direct parameterization and an
adaptive radius predictor module enhanced with constraints to improve its
predicting accuracy. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method
surpasses widely used baselines like InfoNCE and SigLIP loss across
classification, monolingual retrieval, and multilingual retrieval on standard
audio-text datasets. Both the theoretical analysis and the experimental results
on optimizing trajectory drift validate the correctness and effectiveness of
our SVR method.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper presents UniSS, a single-stage expressive speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) framework that solves paired data scarcity, simplifies processing, and enhances translation leveraging large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle challenges in expressive S2ST, including the lack of paired expressive speech data, complex multi-stage pipelines, and limited utilization of large language models for translation.

Method: The authors introduce UniSS, a single-stage framework emphasizing speech semantic and style modeling. It integrates with text-based LLMs using a cross-modal chain-of-thought prompting process for audio-text semantic alignment and style preservation.

Result: UniSS outperforms prior methods in translation fidelity, speech quality, and maintaining voice, emotion, and duration consistency. They also developed and released a large-scale dataset, UniST.

Conclusion: UniSS establishes a more effective and simplified approach for expressive S2ST, marking progress in building advanced systems for translating and preserving expressive speech features.

Abstract: The ultimate goal of expressive speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) is to
accurately translate spoken content while preserving the speaker identity and
emotional style. However, progress in this field is largely hindered by three
key challenges: the scarcity of paired speech data that retains expressive
styles, the complexity of multi-stage processing pipelines, and the limited
transfer of translation capabilities from large language models (LLMs). In this
work, we address these challenges by introducing UniSS, a novel single-stage
framework for expressive S2ST. Our approach features carefully designed speech
semantic and style modeling, enabling seamless integration with existing
text-based LLM frameworks to develop a unified text-speech language model. To
transfer translation capabilities from text to speech, we propose a cross-modal
chain-of-thought prompting process that progressively aligns audio semantics
with text and ensures style preservation in the decoded results. Furthermore,
we construct and release a large-scale, high-quality expressive S2ST dataset,
UniST, comprising 44.8k hours of data. Experimental results show that UniSS
significantly outperforms previous methods in translation fidelity and speech
quality while preserving voice, emotion, and duration consistency. Our work
establishes a simpler and more effective paradigm for building the next
generation of expressive S2ST systems. Audio samples are available at

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR: The paper focuses on utilizing 3D diamond pixel sensors with high radiation tolerance and precision for high-luminosity hadron colliders, employing advanced numerical modeling and neural networks to address signal timing delays caused by resistive electrodes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for tracking detectors in future hadron colliders that can tolerate extreme radiation, provide high spatial resolution, and deliver rapid timing responses, which 3D diamond pixel sensors could fulfill.

Method: The authors extended Ramo-Shockley's formalism using a 3rd-order 3+1D PDE derived from Maxwell's equations. They used numerical methods and charge transport simulations along with a Mixture-of-Experts Physics-Informed Neural Network to serve as a meshless solver for studying timing degradation.

Result: The study provides a detailed analysis of timing degradation in 3D diamond pixel sensors due to electrode resistance by combining numerical solutions and neural network-based approaches.

Conclusion: 3D diamond pixel sensors, coupled with advanced modeling techniques like neural networks, hold promise for meeting the stringent demands of future high-luminosity hadron colliders, although electrode resistivity remains a critical challenge.

Abstract: Future high-luminosity hadron colliders demand tracking detectors with
extreme radiation tolerance, high spatial precision, and sub-nanosecond timing.
3D diamond pixel sensors offer these capabilities due to diamond's radiation
hardness and high carrier mobility. Conductive electrodes, produced via
femtosecond IR laser pulses, exhibit high resistivity that delays signal
propagation. This effect necessitates extending the classical Ramo-Shockley
weighting potential formalism. We model the phenomenon through a 3rd-order,
3+1D PDE derived as a quasi-stationary approximation of Maxwell's equations.
The PDE is solved numerically and coupled with charge transport simulations for
realistic 3D sensor geometries. A Mixture-of-Experts Physics-Informed Neural
Network, trained on Spectral Method data, provides a meshless solver to assess
timing degradation from electrode resistance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitations in prior turbulence closure approaches, which often relied on 2nd-order expansions and resulted in unstable large-eddy simulations.

Method: The authors combine AI with fluid physics principles to derive a closed-form turbulence closure using small direct numerical simulation (DNS) data and sparse-equation discovery.

Result: The newly discovered closure enables accurate and stable large-eddy simulations that reproduce DNS statistics, including extreme events, and aligns with a 4th-order truncated Taylor expansion.

Conclusion: Incorporating inter-scale energy transfer and advanced reconstruction criteria allows for a significant advancement in turbulence modeling, surpassing prior approaches in stability and accuracy.

AI-based work only found the 2nd-order expansion, which led to unstable LES.
The additional terms emerge only when inter-scale energy transfer is considered

### [434] [The Use of the Simplex Architecture to Enhance Safety in Deep-Learning-Powered Autonomous Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21014)
*Federico Nesti,Niko Salamini,Mauro Marinoni,Giorgio Maria Cicero,Gabriele Serra,Alessandro Biondi,Giorgio Buttazzo*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper proposes a software architecture to enhance the safety, security, and predictability of neural network-based autonomous systems, using two isolated execution domains and a real-time hypervisor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks, while high-performing, lack trustworthiness and are subject to misbehavior (e.g., adversarial attacks) and cybersecurity risks on rich operating systems.

Method: It introduces two isolated execution domains on the same platform: one for neural networks under a less trusted operating system, and another for safety-critical functions in a real-time OS, communicating via a type-1 real-time hypervisor.

Result: Experiments on a Furuta pendulum and a rover demonstrate the efficacy of the fail-safe mechanism in mitigating faults caused by learning modules.

Conclusion: The system enhances safety and security in autonomous systems by isolating neural network execution and providing a reliable fallback option.

Abstract: Recently, the outstanding performance reached by neural networks in many
tasks has led to their deployment in autonomous systems, such as robots and
vehicles. However, neural networks are not yet trustworthy, being prone to
different types of misbehavior, such as anomalous samples, distribution shifts,
adversarial attacks, and other threats. Furthermore, frameworks for
accelerating the inference of neural networks typically run on rich operating
systems that are less predictable in terms of timing behavior and present
larger surfaces for cyber-attacks.
  To address these issues, this paper presents a software architecture for
enhancing safety, security, and predictability levels of learning-based
autonomous systems. It leverages two isolated execution domains, one dedicated
to the execution of neural networks under a rich operating system, which is
deemed not trustworthy, and one responsible for running safety-critical
functions, possibly under a different operating system capable of handling
real-time constraints.
  Both domains are hosted on the same computing platform and isolated through a
type-1 real-time hypervisor enabling fast and predictable inter-domain
communication to exchange real-time data. The two domains cooperate to provide
a fail-safe mechanism based on a safety monitor, which oversees the state of
the system and switches to a simpler but safer backup module, hosted in the
safety-critical domain, whenever its behavior is considered untrustworthy.
  The effectiveness of the proposed architecture is illustrated by a set of
experiments performed on two control systems: a Furuta pendulum and a rover.
The results confirm the utility of the fall-back mechanism in preventing faults
due to the learning component.

### [435] [An LLM-based Agentic Framework for Accessible Network Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20600)
*Samuel Lin,Jiawei Zhou,Minlan Yu*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: A system is designed leveraging large language models (LLMs) to simplify network management by enabling natural language interaction for non-expert users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional network management requires expert knowledge, creating barriers for lay users who struggle to manage networks independently.

Method: The paper proposes an agentic framework that uses intermediate representations for configuration across vendor devices, real-time memory retrieval, and external feedback interfaces along with pilot studies and visualization interfaces for user interaction.

Result: Preliminary experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the system components with LLM integration, validated through synthetic and real user data.

Conclusion: The results show promise in democratizing network control using LLMs, facilitating easier use and enabling broader access for everyday users.

Abstract: Traditional approaches to network management have been accessible only to a
handful of highly-trained network operators with significant expert knowledge.
This creates barriers for lay users to easily manage their networks without
resorting to experts. With recent development of powerful large language models
(LLMs) for language comprehension, we design a system to make network
management accessible to a broader audience of non-experts by allowing users to
converse with networks in natural language. To effectively leverage
advancements in LLMs, we propose an agentic framework that uses an intermediate
representation to streamline configuration across diverse vendor equipment,
retrieves the network state from memory in real-time, and provides an interface
for external feedback. We also conduct pilot studies to collect real user data
of natural language utterances for network control, and present a visualization
interface to facilitate dialogue-driven user interaction and enable large-scale
data collection for future development. Preliminary experiments validate the
effectiveness of our proposed system components with LLM integration on both
synthetic and real user utterances. Through our data collection and
visualization efforts, we pave the way for more effective use of LLMs and
democratize network control for everyday users.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a three-layer trustworthy architecture for semantic communication in vehicular networks, addressing trust challenges through innovative mechanisms like semantic camouflage, federated training, and trust management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome trust challenges in deploying semantic communication networks for vehicle-to-everything interactions, which hinder effective communication and network reliability.

Method: The paper introduces mechanisms such as semantic camouflage transmission, federated encoder-decoder training, and audit game-based trust management for addressing security and trust issues.

Result: The proposed three-layer trustworthy VN-SemComNet architecture successfully addresses active eavesdropping, poisoning attacks on encoder-decoder systems, and trust issues within vehicular networks.

Conclusion: The solutions enhance the trust and reliability of vehicular semantic communication networks, paving the way for future research and practical implementations in secure V2X communication.

Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) has the potential to significantly reduce
communication delay in vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications within
vehicular networks (VNs). However, the deployment of vehicular SemCom networks
(VN-SemComNets) faces critical trust challenges in information transmission,
semantic encoding, and communication entity reliability. This paper proposes an
innovative three-layer trustworthy VN-SemComNet architecture. Specifically, we
introduce a semantic camouflage transmission mechanism leveraging defensive
adversarial noise for active eavesdropping defense, a robust federated
encoder-decoder training framework to mitigate encoder-decoder poisoning
attacks, and an audit game-based distributed vehicle trust management mechanism
to deter untrustworthy vehicles. A case study validates the effectiveness of
the proposed solutions. Lastly, essential future research directions are
pointed out to advance this emerging field.

### [437] [Semantic Edge-Cloud Communication for Real-Time Urban Traffic Surveillance with ViT and LLMs over Mobile Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21259)
*Murat Arda Onsu,Poonam Lohan,Burak Kantarci,Aisha Syed,Matthew Andrews,Sean Kennedy*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an efficient edge-cloud semantic communication framework for real-time traffic surveillance that reduces data transmission size by 99.9% while maintaining multimodal LLM accuracy at 89%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient and real-time urban traffic surveillance is challenging due to high computational requirements of LLMs and limited bandwidth for transmitting visual data to the cloud.

Method: The method uses YOLOv11 to detect Regions of Interest (RoIs), encodes them into compact embeddings via Vision Transformers (ViTs), and transmits them to the cloud, where reconstructed images are processed by a multimodal LLM for traffic analysis.

Result: This approach achieves a significant 99.9% reduction in transmitted data size while retaining an LLM response accuracy of 89% for reconstructed images.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates the feasibility of combining ViT and multimodal LLMs for efficient and practical real-time urban traffic surveillance, overcoming computational and bandwidth constraints.

Abstract: Real-time urban traffic surveillance is vital for Intelligent Transportation
Systems (ITS) to ensure road safety, optimize traffic flow, track vehicle
trajectories, and prevent collisions in smart cities. Deploying edge cameras
across urban environments is a standard practice for monitoring road
conditions. However, integrating these with intelligent models requires a
robust understanding of dynamic traffic scenarios and a responsive interface
for user interaction. Although multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) can
interpret traffic images and generate informative responses, their deployment
on edge devices is infeasible due to high computational demands. Therefore, LLM
inference must occur on the cloud, necessitating visual data transmission from
edge to cloud, a process hindered by limited bandwidth, leading to potential
delays that compromise real-time performance. To address this challenge, we
propose a semantic communication framework that significantly reduces
transmission overhead. Our method involves detecting Regions of Interest (RoIs)
using YOLOv11, cropping relevant image segments, and converting them into
compact embedding vectors using a Vision Transformer (ViT). These embeddings
are then transmitted to the cloud, where an image decoder reconstructs the
cropped images. The reconstructed images are processed by a multimodal LLM to
generate traffic condition descriptions. This approach achieves a 99.9%
reduction in data transmission size while maintaining an LLM response accuracy
of 89% for reconstructed cropped images, compared to 93% accuracy with original
cropped images. Our results demonstrate the efficiency and practicality of ViT
and LLM-assisted edge-cloud semantic communication for real-time traffic
surveillance.

### [438] [Reliability Analysis of Fully Homomorphic Encryption Systems Under Memory Faults](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20686)
*Rian Adam Rajagede,Yan Solihin*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper explores how Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) systems behave under memory faults and evaluates the effectiveness of fault mitigation techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the increasing deployment of FHE systems in privacy-critical applications, where reliability under memory faults is poorly understood.

Method: The study analyzes the behavior of FHE systems under memory faults, examining both individual operations and application-level impacts across various schemes, and assesses both traditional and FHE-specific fault mitigation strategies.

Result: It provides insights into the fault behavior of FHE computations and evaluates the impact of different fault mitigation techniques.

Conclusion: Understanding FHE fault behavior and implementing effective fault mitigation are vital for enhancing FHE reliability in real-world applications.

Abstract: Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) represents a paradigm shift in
cryptography, enabling computation directly on encrypted data and unlocking
privacy-critical computation. Despite being increasingly deployed in real
platforms, the reliability aspects of FHE systems, especially how they respond
to faults, have been mostly neglected. This paper aims to better understand of
how FHE computation behaves in the presence of memory faults, both in terms of
individual operations as well as at the level of applications, for different
FHE schemes. Finally, we investigate how effective traditional and FHE-specific
fault mitigation techniques are.

*Jiayi Lin,Liangcai Su,Junzhe Li,Chenxiong Qian*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The study introduces R1-Fuzz, a framework utilizing reinforcement learning to enhance language models for discovering software vulnerabilities, outperforming existing methods and identifying previously unknown vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fuzzing methods struggle with discovering vulnerabilities in complex programs like compilers and database engines due to intricate input constraints. Language models show promise for this but are limited by insufficient exploration of deep program logic and the high cost of larger models.

Method: This paper proposes R1-Fuzz, which combines reinforcement learning with language models. It introduces coverage-slicing-based question construction and a distance-based reward mechanism, using post-training to achieve optimized input generation workflow for fuzzing.

Result: R1-Fuzz achieves up to 75% higher code coverage compared to state-of-the-art fuzzers and identifies 29 newly discovered vulnerabilities. A smaller model version (R1-Fuzz-7B) matches or outperforms larger models in fuzzing tasks.

Conclusion: R1-Fuzz demonstrates the power of integrating RL with language models for vulnerability discovery. It is a practical and cost-efficient solution that rivals larger models and significantly enhances fuzzing outcomes on complex software targets.

Abstract: Fuzzing is effective for vulnerability discovery but struggles with complex
targets such as compilers, interpreters, and database engines, which accept
textual input that must satisfy intricate syntactic and semantic constraints.
Although language models (LMs) have attracted interest for this task due to
their vast latent knowledge and reasoning potential, their practical adoption
has been limited. The major challenges stem from insufficient exploration of
deep program logic among real-world codebases, and the high cost of leveraging
larger models. To overcome these challenges, we propose R1-Fuzz, the first
framework that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to specialize
cost-efficient LMs and integrate them for complex textual fuzzing input
generation. R1-Fuzz introduces two key designs: coverage-slicing-based question
construction and a distance-based reward calculation. Through RL-based
post-training of a model with our constructed dataset, R1-Fuzz designs a
fuzzing workflow that tightly integrates LMs to reason deep program semantics
during fuzzing. Evaluations on diverse real-world targets show that our design
enables a small model, named R1-Fuzz-7B, to rival or even outperform much
larger models in real-world fuzzing. Notably, R1-Fuzz achieves up to 75\%
higher coverage than state-of-the-art fuzzers and discovers 29 previously
unknown vulnerabilities, demonstrating its practicality.

TL;DR: The paper explores centralized, distributed, and federated AI architectures for security management in satellite constellations, emphasizing a trade-off between performance and security.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for efficient, scalable, and secure automated security management systems in satellite constellations.

Method: Examines three AI architectures—centralized, decentralized, and federated—and evaluates their security and performance trade-offs.

Result: Centralized architecture performs better in short-term scenarios but faces communication latency challenges, while decentralized architectures excel in scalability and security over the long term.

Conclusion: Trade-offs exist: centralized systems benefit short-term operations, whereas decentralized systems are better suited for long-term scalability and robustness.

Abstract: This paper investigates the trade-off between centralized and decentralized
security management in constellations of satellites to balance security and
performance. We highlight three key AI architectures for automated security
management: (a) centralized, (b) distributed and (c) federated. The centralized
architecture is the best option short term, providing fast training, despite

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces AutoMalTool, an automated framework for testing vulnerabilities in LLM-based agents due to malicious MCP tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of systematic and automated testing methods for vulnerabilities in LLM-based agents caused by tool poisoning attacks via MCP tools.

Method: Developed AutoMalTool, a framework that generates malicious MCP tools to systematically test the behavior of LLM-based agents against security risks.

Result: Experimental evaluation showed that AutoMalTool effectively creates malicious MCP tools capable of manipulating LLM-based agents while avoiding current detection systems.

Conclusion: AutoMalTool highlights critical security weaknesses in LLM-based agents, stressing the importance of developing improved detection methods to counter tool poisoning attacks.

Abstract: The remarkable capability of large language models (LLMs) has led to the wide
application of LLM-based agents in various domains. To standardize interactions
between LLM-based agents and their environments, model context protocol (MCP)
tools have become the de facto standard and are now widely integrated into
these agents. However, the incorporation of MCP tools introduces the risk of
tool poisoning attacks, which can manipulate the behavior of LLM-based agents.
Although previous studies have identified such vulnerabilities, their red
teaming approaches have largely remained at the proof-of-concept stage, leaving
the automatic and systematic red teaming of LLM-based agents under the MCP tool
poisoning paradigm an open question. To bridge this gap, we propose
AutoMalTool, an automated red teaming framework for LLM-based agents by
generating malicious MCP tools. Our extensive evaluation shows that AutoMalTool
effectively generates malicious MCP tools capable of manipulating the behavior
of mainstream LLM-based agents while evading current detection mechanisms,
thereby revealing new security risks in these agents.

Method: The authors used a lightweight deep learning model (MobileNetV1+GRU), added Gaussian noise, and implemented custom preprocessing using datasets like ECGID and MIT-BIH. They also conducted simulations to mimic wearable and edge scenarios.

Result: The model achieved high accuracy, F1-scores, ROC-AUC values, and low EERs on various datasets, but observed significant accuracy drops under FGSM adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: The study underscores the importance of federated learning, adversarial robustness testing, and diverse datasets for secure, scalable biometrics systems.

### [443] [MARS: A Malignity-Aware Backdoor Defense in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20383)
*Wei Wan,Yuxuan Ning,Zhicong Huang,Cheng Hong,Shengshan Hu,Ziqi Zhou,Yechao Zhang,Tianqing Zhu,Wanlei Zhou,Leo Yu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel defense method named MARS to protect Federated Learning models from advanced backdoor attacks like 3DFed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper arises from Federated Learning's vulnerability to backdoor attacks due to its decentralized nature, particularly addressing the shortcomings of existing defense methods against adaptive attacks like 3DFed.

Method: The paper proposes MARS, which detects backdoor attacks using backdoor energy (BE) to measure neuron malignity, creates concentrated backdoor energy (CBE), and utilizes Wasserstein distance-based clustering to identify malicious models.

Result: Extensive experiments show that MARS effectively defends against state-of-the-art backdoor attacks and performs better than current defenses.

Conclusion: The study concludes that MARS significantly enhances backdoor attack defense in FL environments by addressing the limitations of empirical statistical measures in current methods.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed paradigm aimed at protecting
participant data privacy by exchanging model parameters to achieve high-quality
model training. However, this distributed nature also makes FL highly
vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Notably, the recently proposed state-of-the-art
(SOTA) attack, 3DFed (SP2023), uses an indicator mechanism to determine whether
the backdoor models have been accepted by the defender and adaptively optimizes
backdoor models, rendering existing defenses ineffective. In this paper, we
first reveal that the failure of existing defenses lies in the employment of
empirical statistical measures that are loosely coupled with backdoor attacks.
Motivated by this, we propose a Malignity-Aware backdooR defenSe (MARS) that
leverages backdoor energy (BE) to indicate the malicious extent of each neuron.
To amplify malignity, we further extract the most prominent BE values from each
model to form a concentrated backdoor energy (CBE). Finally, a novel
Wasserstein distance-based clustering method is introduced to effectively
identify backdoor models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MARS can
defend against SOTA backdoor attacks and significantly outperforms existing
defenses.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a privacy scorecard to evaluate the privacy practices of AI-powered coding assistants, identifying gaps and providing guidance for better privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The unclear data handling practices of AI-powered coding assistants create significant privacy, security, and compliance risks for developers and organizations.

Method: A privacy scorecard was created and applied, using analysis of legal policies, external audits, and other documents. 14 weighted criteria were defined and validated by legal and privacy experts.

Result: A measurable 20-point variation was found in privacy practices among AI coding assistants, highlighting widespread weaknesses such as opt-out consent for model training and lack of secret-filtering in user prompts.

Conclusion: The proposed privacy scorecard sets a new benchmark for transparency, aiming to guide more user-centric privacy improvement in the AI industry.

Abstract: The rapid integration of AI-powered coding assistants into developer
workflows has raised significant privacy and trust concerns. As developers
entrust proprietary code to services like OpenAI's GPT, Google's Gemini, and
GitHub Copilot, the unclear data handling practices of these tools create
security and compliance risks. This paper addresses this challenge by
introducing and applying a novel, expert-validated privacy scorecard. The
methodology involves a detailed analysis of four document types; from legal
policies to external audits; to score five leading assistants against 14
weighted criteria. A legal expert and a data protection officer refined these
criteria and their weighting. The results reveal a distinct hierarchy of
privacy protections, with a 20-point gap between the highest- and lowest-ranked
tools. The analysis uncovers common industry weaknesses, including the
pervasive use of opt-out consent for model training and a near-universal
failure to filter secrets from user prompts proactively. The resulting
scorecard provides actionable guidance for developers and organizations,
enabling evidence-based tool selection. This work establishes a new benchmark
for transparency and advocates for a shift towards more user-centric privacy
standards in the AI industry.

*Birk Torpmann-Hagen,Michael A. Riegler,Pål Halvorsen,Dag Johansen*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Security risks arise from embedding malware in neural network checkpoints, and this paper proposes countermeasures involving shuffling weights and biases without compromising accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the neglected security threat of neural network stegomalware, which embeds malicious payloads into neural network checkpoints.

Method: Neutralizing stegomalware by shuffling the column order of weight/bias matrices or the channel order of convolutional layers.

Result: Proposed defense methods effectively disrupt existing neural network steganography techniques with no loss in model accuracy, significantly outperforming alternatives.

Conclusion: The shuffling-based approach is a strong countermeasure against stegomalware, highlights potential challenges in bypassing these defenses, and underscores the need for continued security research in AI systems.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are being utilized in a growing number of applications,
both in production systems and for personal use. Network checkpoints are as a
consequence often shared and distributed on various platforms to ease the
development process. This work considers the threat of neural network
stegomalware, where malware is embedded in neural network checkpoints at a
negligible cost to network accuracy. This constitutes a significant security
concern, but is nevertheless largely neglected by the deep learning
practitioners and security specialists alike. We propose the first effective
countermeasure to these attacks. In particular, we show that state-of-the-art
neural network stegomalware can be efficiently and effectively neutralized
through shuffling the column order of the weight- and bias-matrices, or
equivalently the channel-order of convolutional layers. We show that this
effectively corrupts payloads that have been embedded by state-of-the-art
methods in neural network steganography at no cost to network accuracy,
outperforming competing methods by a significant margin. We then discuss
possible means by which to bypass this defense, additional defense methods, and
advocate for continued research into the security of machine learning systems.

Method: A systematic literature review was conducted using PRISMA guidelines across five major digital libraries. Quantitative trend analysis and thematic taxonomy development were applied to 185 extracted studies.

Result: GANs improve detection accuracy, robustness, and data utility in domains like network intrusion detection and IoT security. Advances include WGAN-GP for stable training and hybrid GAN models for enhanced resilience. However, challenges persist, including training instability and high computational costs.

Conclusion: GAN-based defenses hold significant promise for cybersecurity but require advancements in architecture stability, benchmarking, transparency, and real-world deployment. The paper provides a roadmap for addressing these issues and future trends like LLM-driven attacks.

Abstract: Machine learning-based cybersecurity systems are highly vulnerable to
adversarial attacks, while Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) act as both
powerful attack enablers and promising defenses. This survey systematically
reviews GAN-based adversarial defenses in cybersecurity (2021--August 31,
2025), consolidating recent progress, identifying gaps, and outlining future
directions. Using a PRISMA-compliant systematic literature review protocol, we
searched five major digital libraries. From 829 initial records, 185
peer-reviewed studies were retained and synthesized through quantitative trend
analysis and thematic taxonomy development. We introduce a four-dimensional
taxonomy spanning defensive function, GAN architecture, cybersecurity domain,
and adversarial threat model. GANs improve detection accuracy, robustness, and
data utility across network intrusion detection, malware analysis, and IoT
security. Notable advances include WGAN-GP for stable training, CGANs for
targeted synthesis, and hybrid GAN models for improved resilience. Yet,
persistent challenges remain such as instability in training, lack of
standardized benchmarks, high computational cost, and limited explainability.
GAN-based defenses demonstrate strong potential but require advances in stable
architectures, benchmarking, transparency, and deployment. We propose a roadmap
emphasizing hybrid models, unified evaluation, real-world integration, and
defenses against emerging threats such as LLM-driven cyberattacks. This survey
establishes the foundation for scalable, trustworthy, and adaptive GAN-powered
defenses.

including AI-enabled quantum cryptography and quantum-resistant encryption
protocols. However, QAI inherits data risks from both AI and QC, creating
complex privacy and security vulnerabilities that are not systematically

systems, making their understanding critical. This study systematically reviews
67 privacy- and security-related studies to expand understanding of QAI data
risks. We propose a taxonomy of 22 key data risks, organised into five
categories: governance, risk assessment, control implementation, user
considerations, and continuous monitoring. Our findings reveal vulnerabilities
unique to QAI and identify gaps in holistic risk assessment. This work
contributes to trustworthy AI and QAI research and provides a foundation for

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper explores character-level deep learning models for phishing detection and evaluates their effectiveness in various scenarios, including adversarial conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Phishing attacks pose a growing threat, and existing detection methods often lack robustness and interpretability.

Method: The study employs three character-level deep learning architectures (CharCNN, CharGRU, CharBiLSTM) on a custom email dataset under diverse scenarios, incorporating adversarial training and visualization techniques.

Result: CharGRU achieved the best performance in scenarios with limited computational resources, and adversarial training boosted models' robustness. Grad-CAM adaptation enabled interpretability for character-level inputs.

Conclusion: Character-level models, particularly CharGRU, are promising for phishing detection, offering robustness and interpretability when combined with adversarial training and visualization methods.

Abstract: Phishing attacks targeting both organizations and individuals are becoming an
increasingly significant threat as technology advances. Current automatic
detection methods often lack explainability and robustness in detecting new
phishing attacks. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of
character-level deep learning models for phishing detection, which can provide
both robustness and interpretability. We evaluate three neural architectures
adapted to operate at the character level, namely CharCNN, CharGRU, and
CharBiLSTM, on a custom-built email dataset, which combines data from multiple
sources. Their performance is analyzed under three scenarios: (i) standard
training and testing, (ii) standard training and testing under adversarial
attacks, and (iii) training and testing with adversarial examples. Aiming to
develop a tool that operates as a browser extension, we test all models under
limited computational resources. In this constrained setup, CharGRU proves to
be the best-performing model across all scenarios. All models show
vulnerability to adversarial attacks, but adversarial training substantially
improves their robustness. In addition, by adapting the Gradient-weighted Class
Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) technique to character-level inputs, we are able
to visualize which parts of each email influence the decision of each model.

### [449] [A Framework for Rapidly Developing and Deploying Protection Against Large Language Model Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20639)
*Adam Swanda,Amy Chang,Alexander Chen,Fraser Burch,Paul Kassianik,Konstantin Berlin*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a robust defense system against evolving threats targeting Large Language Models (LLMs), emphasizing rapid reaction, layered protection, and continuous updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of LLMs in various domains has made them attractive targets for malicious attacks, necessitating innovative defense mechanisms.

Method: The authors propose a defense system modeled after malware protection systems, comprising a threat intelligence system, a data platform for observability and monitoring, and a release platform for safe updates.

Result: The integrated system offers continuous protection through layered defenses while ensuring uninterrupted operations for users.

Conclusion: This approach enhances security for LLMs by addressing evolving threats with a robust and adaptable system that fosters continuous improvement.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized AI
deployment, enabling autonomous and semi-autonomous applications across
industries through intuitive language interfaces and continuous improvements in
model development. However, the attendant increase in autonomy and expansion of
access permissions among AI applications also make these systems compelling
targets for malicious attacks. Their inherent susceptibility to security flaws
necessitates robust defenses, yet no known approaches can prevent zero-day or
novel attacks against LLMs. This places AI protection systems in a category
similar to established malware protection systems: rather than providing
guaranteed immunity, they minimize risk through enhanced observability,
multi-layered defense, and rapid threat response, supported by a threat
intelligence function designed specifically for AI-related threats.
  Prior work on LLM protection has largely evaluated individual detection
models rather than end-to-end systems designed for continuous, rapid adaptation
to a changing threat landscape. We present a production-grade defense system
rooted in established malware detection and threat intelligence practices. Our
platform integrates three components: a threat intelligence system that turns
emerging threats into protections; a data platform that aggregates and enriches
information while providing observability, monitoring, and ML operations; and a
release platform enabling safe, rapid detection updates without disrupting
customer workflows. Together, these components deliver layered protection
against evolving LLM threats while generating training data for continuous
model improvement and deploying updates without interrupting production.

*Xiao Liu,Mingyuan Li,Xu Wang,Guangsheng Yu,Wei Ni,Lixiang Li,Haipeng Peng,Renping Liu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces BlockFUL, a framework for federated learning unlearning capabilities within blockchained settings using a dual-chain structure, new unlearning paradigms, and efficient methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for an efficient unlearning mechanism in federated learning models integrated with blockchain technology, which complicates model editing due to interconnected records.

Method: BlockFUL employs a dual-chain structure and introduces parallel and sequential unlearning paradigms, implemented via gradient-ascent-based and retraining-based methods.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate BlockFUL reduces data dependency and operational overhead, improving unlearning efficiency on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST datasets using AlexNet, ResNet18, and MobileNetV2.

Conclusion: BlockFUL establishes a novel approach for unlearning inherited models in blockchained federated learning, addressing critical performance challenges and computational inefficiencies.

Abstract: Unlearning in Federated Learning (FL) presents significant challenges, as
models grow and evolve with complex inheritance relationships. This complexity
is amplified when blockchain is employed to ensure the integrity and
traceability of FL, where the need to edit multiple interlinked blockchain
records and update all inherited models complicates the process.In this paper,
we introduce Blockchained Federated Unlearning (BlockFUL), a novel framework
with a dual-chain structure comprising a live chain and an archive chain for
enabling unlearning capabilities within Blockchained FL. BlockFUL introduces
two new unlearning paradigms, i.e., parallel and sequential paradigms, which
can be effectively implemented through gradient-ascent-based and
re-training-based unlearning methods. These methods enhance the unlearning
process across multiple inherited models by enabling efficient consensus
operations and reducing computational costs. Our extensive experiments validate
that these methods effectively reduce data dependency and operational overhead,
thereby boosting the overall performance of unlearning inherited models within
BlockFUL on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST datasets using AlexNet, ResNet18, and
MobileNetV2 models.

### [451] [PMark: Towards Robust and Distortion-free Semantic-level Watermarking with Channel Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21057)
*Jiahao Huo,Shuliang Liu,Bin Wang,Junyan Zhang,Yibo Yan,Aiwei Liu,Xuming Hu,Mingxun Zhou*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces PMark, a semantic-level watermarking (SWM) method for large language models that improves robustness against text modifications and paraphrasing while maintaining text quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the robustness of semantic-level watermarking techniques for large language models against paraphrasing and text modifications without introducing significant distortions.

Method: The paper proposes PMark, a method based on proxy functions (PFs) that map sentences to scalar values, dynamically estimating PF medians and introducing multi-channel constraints to fortify watermark evidence.

Result: PMark demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods in both robustness to paraphrasing attacks and preservation of text quality, validated through experimental results.

Conclusion: The PMark method provides solid theoretical guarantees, eliminates distortion, and supports efficient detection of machine-generated text, setting a new benchmark for SWM performance.

Abstract: Semantic-level watermarking (SWM) for large language models (LLMs) enhances
watermarking robustness against text modifications and paraphrasing attacks by
treating the sentence as the fundamental unit. However, existing methods still
lack strong theoretical guarantees of robustness, and reject-sampling-based
generation often introduces significant distribution distortions compared with
unwatermarked outputs. In this work, we introduce a new theoretical framework
on SWM through the concept of proxy functions (PFs) $\unicode{x2013}$ functions
that map sentences to scalar values. Building on this framework, we propose
PMark, a simple yet powerful SWM method that estimates the PF median for the
next sentence dynamically through sampling while enforcing multiple PF
constraints (which we call channels) to strengthen watermark evidence. Equipped
with solid theoretical guarantees, PMark achieves the desired distortion-free
property and improves the robustness against paraphrasing-style attacks. We
also provide an empirically optimized version that further removes the
requirement for dynamical median estimation for better sampling efficiency.
Experimental results show that PMark consistently outperforms existing SWM
baselines in both text quality and robustness, offering a more effective
paradigm for detecting machine-generated text. Our code will be released at

*Yu Liu,Boxiang He,Fanggang Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a secure and adaptable semantic-driven framework for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), employing adversarial attack mechanisms to enhance system security.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address vulnerabilities in ISAC systems regarding privacy and eavesdropping risks while maintaining system performance.

Method: Design of pluggable encryption and decryption modules using trainable adversarial residual networks (ARNs), optimized via a loss function balancing SAC performance and privacy risk.

Result: Simulations demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in maintaining SAC performance and mitigating eavesdropping threats.

Conclusion: The SS-ISAC framework successfully integrates security measures into ISAC setups without significant hardware changes, ensuring robust performance and security.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel and flexible security-aware semantic-driven
integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework, namely security semantic
ISAC (SS-ISAC). Inspired by the positive impact of the adversarial attack, a
pair of pluggable encryption and decryption modules is designed in the proposed
SS-ISAC framework. The encryption module is installed after the semantic
transmitter, adopting a trainable adversarial residual network (ARN) to create
the adversarial attack. Correspondingly, the decryption module before the
semantic receiver utilizes another trainable ARN to mitigate the adversarial
attack and noise. These two modules can be flexibly assembled considering the
system security demands, without drastically modifying the hardware
infrastructure. To ensure the sensing and communication (SAC) performance while
preventing the eavesdropping threat, the above ARNs are jointly optimized by
minimizing a carefully designed loss function that relates to the adversarial
attack power, SAC performance, as well as the privacy leakage risk. Simulation
results validate the effectiveness of the proposed SS-ISAC framework in terms
of both SAC and eavesdropping prevention performance.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper develops a robust intrusion detection framework for drone networks using ensemble-based machine learning models, achieving near-perfect accuracy and incorporating explainable AI methods for model interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing cybersecurity risks in drone communication protocols due to sophisticated attack vectors demand robust detection mechanisms.

Method: The study uses ensemble-based machine learning methods trained on a labeled dataset, enriched by preprocessing techniques and interprets model predictions using SHAP and LIME.

Result: Random Forest achieved outstanding performance with a macro F1-score of 0.9998 and ROC AUC of 1.0000, validated further using statistical tests.

Conclusion: The framework delivers high accuracy and interpretability, making it suitable for real-time, safety-critical drone operations.

Abstract: The growing integration of drones into civilian, commercial, and defense
sectors introduces significant cybersecurity concerns, particularly with the
increased risk of network-based intrusions targeting drone communication
protocols. Detecting and classifying these intrusions is inherently challenging
due to the dynamic nature of drone traffic and the presence of multiple
sophisticated attack vectors such as spoofing, injection, replay, and
man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. This research aims to develop a robust and
interpretable intrusion detection framework tailored for drone networks, with a
focus on handling multi-class classification and model explainability. We
present a comparative analysis of ensemble-based machine learning models,
namely Random Forest, Extra Trees, AdaBoost, CatBoost, and XGBoost, trained on
a labeled dataset comprising benign traffic and nine distinct intrusion types.
Comprehensive data preprocessing was performed, including missing value
imputation, scaling, and categorical encoding, followed by model training and
extensive evaluation using metrics such as macro F1-score, ROC AUC, Matthews
Correlation Coefficient, and Log Loss. Random Forest achieved the highest
performance with a macro F1-score of 0.9998 and ROC AUC of 1.0000. To validate
the superiority of the models, statistical tests, including Friedmans test, the
Wilcoxon signed-rank test with Holm correction, and bootstrapped confidence
intervals, were applied. Furthermore, explainable AI methods, SHAP and LIME,
were integrated to interpret both global and local feature importance,
enhancing model transparency and decision trustworthiness. The proposed
approach not only delivers near-perfect accuracy but also ensures
interpretability, making it highly suitable for real-time and safety-critical
drone operations.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces an automated pipeline for gathering cyber threat intelligence (CTI) from Telegram to create a high-quality dataset for cyber threat detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CTI effectiveness hinges on robust datasets to anticipate and combat evolving cyber threats, necessitating innovative sources like Telegram.

Method: An end-to-end automated system using a BERT-based classifier is developed to collect, filter, and analyze CTI data from Telegram channels with 96.64% accuracy.

Result: 145,349 messages were scraped from 12 curated Telegram channels; 86,509 Indicators of Compromise were compiled, including domains, IPs, URLs, hashes, and CVEs.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline establishes an efficient approach to generating large-scale, high-quality CTI datasets, advancing cyber threat research and operational capabilities.

Abstract: Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) enables organizations to anticipate, detect,
and mitigate evolving cyber threats. Its effectiveness depends on high-quality
datasets, which support model development, training, evaluation, and
benchmarking. Building such datasets is crucial, as attack vectors and
adversary tactics continually evolve. Recently, Telegram has gained prominence
as a valuable CTI source, offering timely and diverse threat-related
information that can help address these challenges. In this work, we address
these challenges by presenting an end-to-end automated pipeline that
systematically collects and filters threat-related content from Telegram. The
pipeline identifies relevant Telegram channels and scrapes 145,349 messages
from 12 curated channels out of 150 identified sources. To accurately filter
threat intelligence messages from generic content, we employ a BERT-based
classifier, achieving an accuracy of 96.64%. From the filtered messages, we
compile a dataset of 86,509 malicious Indicators of Compromise, including
domains, IPs, URLs, hashes, and CVEs. This approach not only produces a
large-scale, high-fidelity CTI dataset but also establishes a foundation for
future research and operational applications in cyber threat detection.

*Ibrahim Altan,Abdulla Bachir,Yousuf Parbhulkar,Abdul Muksith Rizvi,Moshiur Farazi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a phishing detection framework that combines NLP and machine learning to analyze email texts and URLs, significantly improving detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional phishing detection methods fail to address sophisticated email attacks comprehensively.

Method: A dual-path detection framework using fine-tuned transformers for text analysis and TF-IDF with classical classifiers for URL evaluation.

Result: The approach boosts detection accuracy, with DistilBERT excelling in text analysis and Random Forest performing well for URL examination.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is accurate, scalable, and interpretable, enhancing email security against modern phishing threats.

Abstract: Phishing emails pose a persistent and increasingly sophisticated threat,
undermining email security through deceptive tactics designed to exploit both
semantic and structural vulnerabilities. Traditional detection methods, often
based on isolated analysis of email content or embedded URLs, fail to
comprehensively address these evolving attacks. In this paper, we propose a
dual-path phishing detection framework that integrates transformer-based
natural language processing (NLP) with classical machine learning to jointly
analyze email text and embedded URLs. Our approach leverages the complementary
strengths of semantic analysis using fine-tuned transformer architectures
(e.g., DistilBERT) and structural link analysis via character-level TF-IDF
vectorization paired with classical classifiers (e.g., Random Forest).
Empirical evaluation on representative email and URL datasets demonstrates that
this combined approach significantly improves detection accuracy. Specifically,
the DistilBERT model achieves a near-optimal balance between accuracy and
computational efficiency for textual phishing detection, while Random Forest
notably outperforms other classical classifiers in identifying malicious URLs.
The modular design allows flexibility for standalone deployment or ensemble
integration, facilitating real-world adoption. Collectively, our results
highlight the efficacy and practical value of this dual-path approach,
establishing a scalable, accurate, and interpretable solution capable of
enhancing email security against contemporary phishing threats.

*Anh Tu Ngo,Anupam Chattopadhyay,Subhamoy Maitra*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper examines cryptographic backdoors in neural networks (NN), showing their dual roles in attacks and defenses. It introduces robust protocols for watermarking, user authentication, and intellectual property tracking, supported by theoretical and empirical results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the effectiveness and robustness of cryptographic backdoors in neural networks both for attacks and defensive mechanisms, bridging practical implementations and theoretical foundations.

Method: The authors develop provably robust protocols for NN watermarking, user authentication, and intellectual property tracking, leveraging ideas from Goldwasser et al. They empirically test these protocols on state-of-the-art NN architectures, integrating post-quantum primitives for future applications.

Result: The protocols demonstrated strong defense capabilities (watermarking, authentication, IP tracking) and practical implementation feasibility. However, adversarial attacks using backdoors remain unpreventable under standard assumptions.

Conclusion: Cryptographic backdoors can effectively mount attacks and provide defenses in neural networks. The presented protocols are provably and empirically robust with potential for quantum-era advancements in machine learning.

Abstract: In this paper we show that cryptographic backdoors in a neural network (NN)
can be highly effective in two directions, namely mounting the attacks as well
as in presenting the defenses as well. On the attack side, a carefully planted
cryptographic backdoor enables powerful and invisible attack on the NN.
Considering the defense, we present applications: first, a provably robust NN
watermarking scheme; second, a protocol for guaranteeing user authentication;
and third, a protocol for tracking unauthorized sharing of the NN intellectual
property (IP). From a broader theoretical perspective, borrowing the ideas from
Goldwasser et. al. [FOCS 2022], our main contribution is to show that all these
instantiated practical protocol implementations are provably robust. The
protocols for watermarking, authentication and IP tracking resist an adversary
with black-box access to the NN, whereas the backdoor-enabled adversarial
attack is impossible to prevent under the standard assumptions. While the
theoretical tools used for our attack is mostly in line with the Goldwasser et.
al. ideas, the proofs related to the defense need further studies. Finally, all
these protocols are implemented on state-of-the-art NN architectures with
empirical results corroborating the theoretical claims. Further, one can
utilize post-quantum primitives for implementing the cryptographic backdoors,
laying out foundations for quantum-era applications in machine learning (ML).

(QC), Chaos-Based Encryption (CBE), Neuromorphic Computing (NC), and Swarm
Intelligence (SI). For each paradigm, we assess its relevance to the FL
pipeline, outlining its strengths, limitations, and practical considerations.
We conclude by highlighting open challenges and prospective research avenues,
offering a detailed roadmap for advancing secure and scalable FL systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SGAligner++, a cross-modal framework for 3D scene graph alignment, which effectively deals with noisy and incomplete data using lightweight encoders and attention-based fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the need to align 3D scene graphs for robot navigation and embodied perception, addressing challenges like noise, incomplete data, and cross-modality issues in existing methods.

Method: The method involves learning a joint embedding space with lightweight unimodal encoders and attention-based fusion to handle cross-modal and partially overlapping scene observations.

Result: The framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 40% in real-world datasets, showcasing effective alignment and cross-modal generalization under noisy conditions.

Conclusion: SGAligner++ improves 3D scene graph alignment with enhanced accuracy and scalability, offering notable contributions to tasks like visual localization, reconstruction, and navigation.

Abstract: Aligning 3D scene graphs is a crucial initial step for several applications
in robot navigation and embodied perception. Current methods in 3D scene graph
alignment often rely on single-modality point cloud data and struggle with
incomplete or noisy input. We introduce SGAligner++, a cross-modal,
language-aided framework for 3D scene graph alignment. Our method addresses the
challenge of aligning partially overlapping scene observations across
heterogeneous modalities by learning a unified joint embedding space, enabling
accurate alignment even under low-overlap conditions and sensor noise. By
employing lightweight unimodal encoders and attention-based fusion, SGAligner++
enhances scene understanding for tasks such as visual localization, 3D
reconstruction, and navigation, while ensuring scalability and minimal
computational overhead. Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets
demonstrate that SGAligner++ outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 40%
on noisy real-world reconstructions, while enabling cross-modal generalization.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces SceneWeaver, an innovative framework for synthesizing visually realistic, physically plausible, and functionally diverse indoor 3D scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in current scene synthesis methods, including fixed scene categories, insufficient object-level detail, lack of physical consistency, and challenges in aligning with user instructions.

Method: Proposes SceneWeaver, a framework using a language model-based planner and diverse scene generation tools to iteratively refine environments via closed-loop reason-act-reflect cycles.

Result: SceneWeaver outperforms existing methods in creating physically, visually, and semantically coherent scenes, and generalizes effectively to complex and diverse instructions.

Conclusion: SceneWeaver represents a significant advancement toward general-purpose 3D environment generation with improved physical, visual, and semantic properties.

Abstract: Indoor scene synthesis has become increasingly important with the rise of
Embodied AI, which requires 3D environments that are not only visually
realistic but also physically plausible and functionally diverse. While recent
approaches have advanced visual fidelity, they often remain constrained to
fixed scene categories, lack sufficient object-level detail and physical
consistency, and struggle to align with complex user instructions. In this
work, we present SceneWeaver, a reflective agentic framework that unifies
diverse scene synthesis paradigms through tool-based iterative refinement. At
its core, SceneWeaver employs a language model-based planner to select from a
suite of extensible scene generation tools, ranging from data-driven generative
models to visual- and LLM-based methods, guided by self-evaluation of physical
plausibility, visual realism, and semantic alignment with user input. This
closed-loop reason-act-reflect design enables the agent to identify semantic
inconsistencies, invoke targeted tools, and update the environment over
successive iterations. Extensive experiments on both common and open-vocabulary
room types demonstrate that SceneWeaver not only outperforms prior methods on
physical, visual, and semantic metrics, but also generalizes effectively to
complex scenes with diverse instructions, marking a step toward general-purpose
3D environment generation. Project website: https://scene-weaver.github.io/.

*Yuguang Chen,Xinhai Liu,Yang Li,Victor Cheung,Zhuo Chen,Dongyu Zhang,Chunchao Guo*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: ArtUV automates UV unwrapping by using a two-stage process to create artist-style UV maps with semantic coherence and minimal distortion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UV unwrapping methods face limitations like fragmentation, semantic inconsistency, inefficiency, and irregular mapping results.

Method: ArtUV employs a two-stage approach: SeamGPT generates meaningful cutting seams, followed by an Auto-Encoder refining rough UV mapping into artist-style UV maps.

Result: ArtUV achieves semantic consistency, efficient space use, and clean UV boundaries, suitable for professional rendering workflows and standalone deployment.

Conclusion: ArtUV provides a versatile and automated solution for generating artist-style UV maps that can integrate into rendering pipelines or function independently.

Abstract: UV unwrapping is an essential task in computer graphics, enabling various
visual editing operations in rendering pipelines. However, existing UV
unwrapping methods struggle with time-consuming, fragmentation, lack of
semanticity, and irregular UV islands, limiting their practical use. An
artist-style UV map must not only satisfy fundamental criteria, such as
overlap-free mapping and minimal distortion, but also uphold higher-level
standards, including clean boundaries, efficient space utilization, and
semantic coherence. We introduce ArtUV, a fully automated, end-to-end method
for generating artist-style UV unwrapping. We simulates the professional UV
mapping process by dividing it into two stages: surface seam prediction and
artist-style UV parameterization. In the seam prediction stage, SeamGPT is used
to generate semantically meaningful cutting seams. Then, in the
parameterization stage, a rough UV obtained from an optimization-based method,
along with the mesh, is fed into an Auto-Encoder, which refines it into an
artist-style UV map. Our method ensures semantic consistency and preserves
topological structure, making the UV map ready for 2D editing. We evaluate
ArtUV across multiple benchmarks and show that it serves as a versatile
solution, functioning seamlessly as either a plug-in for professional rendering
tools or as a standalone system for rapid, high-quality UV generation.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This paper introduces SeamCrafter, a GPT-style model for generating efficient seams on 3D surfaces to improve UV parametrization and texture mapping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in avoiding high UV distortion and excessive fragmentation from poorly placed seams, which disrupt workflows and texture synthesis.

Method: The authors designed a GPT-style seam generator with a dual-branch point-cloud encoder. The model uses Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on a preference dataset derived from a seam-evaluation framework measuring UV distortion and fragmentation.

Result: SeamCrafter achieves significantly reduced UV distortion and fragmentation compared to existing methods while maintaining topological consistency and visual appeal.

Conclusion: SeamCrafter successfully automates seam generation with superior quality, outperforming prior methods in both UV distortion and seam fragmentation.

Abstract: Mesh seams play a pivotal role in partitioning 3D surfaces for UV
parametrization and texture mapping. Poorly placed seams often result in severe
UV distortion or excessive fragmentation, thereby hindering texture synthesis
and disrupting artist workflows. Existing methods frequently trade one failure
mode for another-producing either high distortion or many scattered islands. To
address this, we introduce SeamCrafter, an autoregressive GPT-style seam
generator conditioned on point cloud inputs. SeamCrafter employs a dual-branch
point-cloud encoder that disentangles and captures complementary topological
and geometric cues during pretraining. To further enhance seam quality, we
fine-tune the model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on a preference
dataset derived from a novel seam-evaluation framework. This framework assesses
seams primarily by UV distortion and fragmentation, and provides pairwise
preference labels to guide optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SeamCrafter produces seams with substantially lower distortion and
fragmentation than prior approaches, while preserving topological consistency
and visual fidelity.

*Jiabao Lei,Kewei Shi,Zhihao Liang,Kui Jia*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel auto-regressive model for 3D mesh generation, following a coarse-to-fine approach inspired by 2D image refinement models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of auto-regressive 3D mesh generation methods that construct meshes face by face in a lexicographic order, failing to capture geometry in a way consistent with human perception.

Method: The proposed method generalizes meshes to simplicial complexes and employs a transformer-based auto-regressive model to generate meshes progressively, starting from a single point and adding geometric details through local remeshing.

Result: Experiments demonstrated that the proposed approach enables intuitive control over generation quality and time by early stopping, as well as facilitates applications like mesh refinement and editing.

Conclusion: Progressive coarse-to-fine 3D mesh generation provides a more intuitive, flexible, and human-perception-aligned approach to constructing 3D meshes, offering clear applications and benefits.

Abstract: Directly generating 3D meshes, the default representation for 3D shapes in
the graphics industry, using auto-regressive (AR) models has become popular
these days, thanks to their sharpness, compactness in the generated results,
and ability to represent various types of surfaces. However, AR mesh generative
models typically construct meshes face by face in lexicographic order, which
does not effectively capture the underlying geometry in a manner consistent
with human perception. Inspired by 2D models that progressively refine images,
such as the prevailing next-scale prediction AR models, we propose generating
meshes auto-regressively in a progressive coarse-to-fine manner. Specifically,
we view mesh simplification algorithms, which gradually merge mesh faces to
build simpler meshes, as a natural fine-to-coarse process. Therefore, we
generalize meshes to simplicial complexes and develop a transformer-based AR
model to approximate the reverse process of simplification in the order of
level of detail, constructing meshes initially from a single point and
gradually adding geometric details through local remeshing, where the topology
is not predefined and is alterable. Our experiments show that this novel
progressive mesh generation approach not only provides intuitive control over
generation quality and time consumption by early stopping the auto-regressive
process but also enables applications such as mesh refinement and editing.

Motivation: Current VR/MR/AR tools for architecture are limited in scalability and rely on rigid annotations, making it challenging to apply them across diverse environments.

Method: The paper introduces a data pipeline that filters architectural scenes through 3D reconstruction and semantic segmentation, uses LLM-guided text verification, and refines metadata for generating high-quality annotations. This is followed by fine-tuning a multimodal backbone, ShareGPT4V-7B, with the curated Arch-300K dataset.

Result: The result is ArchGPT—a visual question answering model—trained on the Arch-300K dataset offering richer and more scalable interactions with architectural data.

Conclusion: ArchGPT paves the way for more immersive, scalable, and meaningful exploration of architecture using multimodal technologies, overcoming limitations of existing systems.

Abstract: Architecture embodies aesthetic, cultural, and historical values, standing as
a tangible testament to human civilization. Researchers have long leveraged
virtual reality (VR), mixed reality (MR), and augmented reality (AR) to enable
immersive exploration and interpretation of architecture, enhancing
accessibility, public understanding, and creative workflows around architecture
in education, heritage preservation, and professional design practice. However,
existing VR/MR/AR systems are often developed case-by-case, relying on
hard-coded annotations and task-specific interactions that do not scale across
diverse built environments. In this work, we present ArchGPT, a multimodal
architectural visual question answering (VQA) model, together with a scalable
data-construction pipeline for curating high-quality, architecture-specific VQA
annotations. This pipeline yields Arch-300K, a domain-specialized dataset of
approximately 315,000 image-question-answer triplets. Arch-300K is built via a
multi-stage process: first, we curate architectural scenes from Wikimedia
Commons and filter unconstrained tourist photo collections using a novel
coarse-to-fine strategy that integrates 3D reconstruction and semantic
segmentation to select occlusion-free, structurally consistent architectural
images. To mitigate noise and inconsistency in raw textual metadata, we propose
an LLM-guided text verification and knowledge-distillation pipeline to generate
reliable, architecture-specific question-answer pairs. Using these curated
images and refined metadata, we further synthesize formal analysis
annotations-including detailed descriptions and aspect-guided conversations-to
provide richer semantic variety while remaining faithful to the data. We
perform supervised fine-tuning of an open-source multimodal backbone
,ShareGPT4V-7B, on Arch-300K, yielding ArchGPT.

### [464] [Marching Neurons: Accurate Surface Extraction for Neural Implicit Shapes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21007)
*Christian Stippel,Felix Mujkanovic,Thomas Leimkühler,Pedro Hermosilla*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method to extract 3D surface geometry from neural implicit functions with high accuracy, avoiding spatial sampling issues in conventional approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional methods, like Marching Cubes, face resolution limitations, necessitating a more accurate approach for extracting surfaces from implicit representations.

Method: The proposed method analytically extracts surfaces by leveraging neural implicit function structure, using a depth-first traversal strategy to partition the domain without spatial discretization.

Result: The approach generates meshes with high fidelity, preserving detailed geometric information and achieving competitive efficiency on diverse shapes and neural architectures.

Conclusion: The introduced technique surpasses traditional methods in accuracy and adapts well to complex geometries, offering a significant advancement in surface extraction from neural representations.

Abstract: Accurate surface geometry representation is crucial in 3D visual computing.
Explicit representations, such as polygonal meshes, and implicit
representations, like signed distance functions, each have distinct advantages,
making efficient conversions between them increasingly important. Conventional
surface extraction methods for implicit representations, such as the widely
used Marching Cubes algorithm, rely on spatial decomposition and sampling,
leading to inaccuracies due to fixed and limited resolution. We introduce a
novel approach for analytically extracting surfaces from neural implicit
functions. Our method operates natively in parallel and can navigate large
neural architectures. By leveraging the fact that each neuron partitions the
domain, we develop a depth-first traversal strategy to efficiently track the
encoded surface. The resulting meshes faithfully capture the full geometric
information from the network without ad-hoc spatial discretization, achieving
unprecedented accuracy across diverse shapes and network architectures while
maintaining competitive speed.

### [465] [CHARM: Control-point-based 3D Anime Hairstyle Auto-Regressive Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21114)
*Yuze He,Yanning Zhou,Wang Zhao,Jingwen Ye,Yushi Bai,Kaiwen Xiao,Yong-Jin Liu,Zhongqian Sun,Wei Yang*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces CHARM, a novel framework for modeling anime hairstyles, utilizing a parametric approach via control points for efficient and artist-friendly representation. It includes a generative framework and a large-scale dataset for training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D hair modeling focus mostly on realistic hair and are unsuitable for stylized anime hairstyles, which are geometrically complex and require flexibility in design and scalability in learning.

Method: CHARM uses control-point-based parameterization for hair card representation. It incorporates an autoregressive transformer to simulate hairstyle topology and geometry, treating it as a 'hair language.' Additionally, the authors created a large dataset (AnimeHair) to facilitate the training and evaluation.

Result: Experiments show CHARM outperforms previous approaches in reconstruction and generative accuracy, creating high-fidelity and scalable anime hairstyles.

Conclusion: CHARM provides an effective and scalable solution for anime hairstyle modeling by introducing artist-friendly parametric representation and machine learning-based generative capabilities.

Abstract: We present CHARM, a novel parametric representation and generative framework
for anime hairstyle modeling. While traditional hair modeling methods focus on
realistic hair using strand-based or volumetric representations, anime
hairstyle exhibits highly stylized, piecewise-structured geometry that
challenges existing techniques. Existing works often rely on dense mesh
modeling or hand-crafted spline curves, making them inefficient for editing and
unsuitable for scalable learning. CHARM introduces a compact, invertible
control-point-based parameterization, where a sequence of control points
represents each hair card, and each point is encoded with only five geometric
parameters. This efficient and accurate representation supports both
artist-friendly design and learning-based generation. Built upon this
representation, CHARM introduces an autoregressive generative framework that
effectively generates anime hairstyles from input images or point clouds. By
interpreting anime hairstyles as a sequential "hair language", our
autoregressive transformer captures both local geometry and global hairstyle
topology, resulting in high-fidelity anime hairstyle creation. To facilitate
both training and evaluation of anime hairstyle generation, we construct
AnimeHair, a large-scale dataset of 37K high-quality anime hairstyles with
separated hair cards and processed mesh data. Extensive experiments demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance of CHARM in both reconstruction accuracy and
generation quality, offering an expressive and scalable solution for anime
hairstyle modeling. Project page: https://hyzcluster.github.io/charm/

### [466] [Optimal Transport Based Hyperspectral Unmixing for Highly Mixed Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20417)
*D. Doutsas,B. Figliuzzi*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an optimal transport (OT) approach for blind hyperspectral unmixing, aimed at improving abundance matrix estimations in highly mixed data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to accurately estimate the abundance matrix in highly mixed hyperspectral data, which is vital for identifying endmembers.

Method: The authors propose an optimization method leveraging OT to minimize the difference between the estimated abundance matrix and a targeted Dirichlet distribution, including this as a regularization term.

Result: Using an unsupervised deep learning framework, experiments demonstrate that the method improves endmember estimation and is robust to variations in the target distribution.

Conclusion: The method improves performance in hyperspectral unmixing for challenging data scenarios while showing flexibility in the choice of target distributions.

Abstract: We propose a novel approach based on optimal transport (OT) for tackling the
problem of highly mixed data in blind hyperspectral unmixing. Our method
constrains the distribution of the estimated abundance matrix to resemble a
targeted Dirichlet distribution more closely. The novelty lies in using OT to
measure the discrepancy between the targeted and true abundance distributions,
which we incorporate as a regularization term in our optimization problem. We
demonstrate the efficiency of our method through a case study involving an
unsupervised deep learning approach. Our experiments show that the proposed
approach allows for a better estimation of the endmembers in the presence of
highly mixed data, while displaying robustness to the choice of target
abundance distribution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges like application development, portability, and reproducibility in quantum computing, enabling modular quantum programs and hybrid quantum workflows.

Method: The authors develop a middleware in HPC environments featuring secondary scheduling, monitoring, observability, and integrating multiple SDKs using the vendor-neutral QRMI interface.

Result: The proposed system demonstrates improved QPU utilization and provides tools for monitoring and management within hybrid quantum-classical architectures.

Conclusion: The work advances modular and portable quantum program execution environments within HPC frameworks, facilitating resource optimization and enhanced functionality.

Abstract: Robust execution environments are important for addressing key challenges in
quantum computing, such as application development, portability, and
reproducibility, and help unlock the development of modular quantum programs,
driving forward hybrid quantum workflows. In this work, we show progress
towards a basic, but portable, runtime environment for developing and executing
hybrid quantum-classical programs running in High Performance Computing (HPC)
environments enhanced with Quantum Processing Units (QPUs). The middleware
includes a second layer of scheduling after the main HPC resource manager in
order to improve the utilization of the QPU, and extra functionality for
observability, monitoring, and admin access. This approach enables managing
multiple programming Software Development Kits (SDKs) as first-class citizens
in the environment by building on a recently proposed vendor-neutral Quantum
Resource Management Interface (QRMI). Lastly, we discuss and show a solution
for the monitoring and observability stack, completing our description of the
hybrid system architecture.

*Yiming Huang,Yajie Hao,Jing Zhou,Xiao Yuan,Xiaoting Wang,Yuxuan Du*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are improved by reformulating their training dynamics into a nonlinear PDE and leveraging physics-informed neural networks to minimize quantum resource costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum devices face prohibitive costs for large-scale tasks due to constraints like the no-cloning theorem, making efficient training methods for VQAs crucial.

Method: This paper proposes modeling VQA training as a nonlinear partial differential equation and utilizing physics-informed neural networks to predict parameter updates efficiently, requiring minimal quantum trajectory data.

Result: The proposed method achieves up to 30x computational speedup and reduces quantum resource costs by up to 90%, demonstrating effectiveness in tasks using up to 40 qubits.

Conclusion: The method significantly enhances the efficiency of VQAs while maintaining high accuracy, advancing the scalability and practical utility of quantum algorithms.

Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are leading strategies to reach
practical utilities of near-term quantum devices. However, the no-cloning
theorem in quantum mechanics precludes standard backpropagation, leading to
prohibitive quantum resource costs when applying VQAs to large-scale tasks. To
address this challenge, we reformulate the training dynamics of VQAs as a
nonlinear partial differential equation and propose a novel protocol that
leverages physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to model this dynamical
system efficiently. Given a small amount of training trajectory data collected
from quantum devices, our protocol predicts the parameter updates of VQAs over
multiple iterations on the classical side, dramatically reducing quantum
resource costs. Through systematic numerical experiments, we demonstrate that
our method achieves up to a 30x speedup compared to conventional methods and
reduces quantum resource costs by as much as 90\% for tasks involving up to 40
qubits, including ground state preparation of different quantum systems, while
maintaining competitive accuracy. Our approach complements existing techniques
aimed at improving the efficiency of VQAs and further strengthens their
potential for practical applications.

*Kai Zhang,Corey D Barrett,Jangwon Kim,Lichao Sun,Tara Taghavi,Krishnaram Kenthapadi*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: RadAgents is a multi-agent framework for improving chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation by using clinical priors, multimodal reasoning, and retrieval-augmented grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations in existing chest X-ray interpretation methods, such as lack of clinical interpretability, insufficient multimodal evidence fusion, and the absence of mechanisms for detecting and resolving tool inconsistencies.

Method: RadAgents employs a multi-agent framework that integrates clinical priors, task-aware multimodal reasoning, grounding, and multimodal retrieval-augmentation to improve interpretation quality.

Result: RadAgents provides outputs that are more reliable, transparent, and clinically consistent compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: The RadAgents framework represents a step forward in automated CXR interpretation by enhancing reliability, transparency, and alignment with clinical practices through its novel approach.

Abstract: Agentic systems offer a potential path to solve complex clinical tasks
through collaboration among specialized agents, augmented by tool use and
external knowledge bases. Nevertheless, for chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation,
prevailing methods remain limited: (i) reasoning is frequently neither
clinically interpretable nor aligned with guidelines, reflecting mere
aggregation of tool outputs; (ii) multimodal evidence is insufficiently fused,
yielding text-only rationales that are not visually grounded; and (iii) systems
rarely detect or resolve cross-tool inconsistencies and provide no principled
verification mechanisms. To bridge the above gaps, we present RadAgents, a
multi-agent framework for CXR interpretation that couples clinical priors with
task-aware multimodal reasoning. In addition, we integrate grounding and
multimodal retrieval-augmentation to verify and resolve context conflicts,
resulting in outputs that are more reliable, transparent, and consistent with
clinical practice.

### [470] [Structuring Collective Action with LLM-Guided Evolution: From Ill-Structured Problems to Executable Heuristics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20412)
*Kevin Bradley Dsouza,Graham Alexander Watt,Yuri Leonenko,Juan Moreno-Cruz*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper introduces the ECHO-MIMIC framework to address ill-structured collective action problems by evolving heuristics and messages tailored for individual decision-makers to align with collective goals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to solve classic ill-structured problems in collective action, such as misalignments between individual incentives and collective needs, by converting them into tractable well-structured problems for individual agents.

Method: ECHO-MIMIC operates in two stages: ECHO evolves behavioral policies as Python code snippets, and MIMIC evolves natural language messages to motivate adoption of these policies, both using a large-language-model-driven evolutionary search.

Result: ECHO-MIMIC is applied to agricultural landscape management, demonstrating high-performing heuristics and successful alignment of individual farming behavior with global ecological goals, outperforming baseline methods.

Conclusion: ECHO-MIMIC effectively transforms the complexity of ill-structured problems into executable agent-level strategies, providing a scalable and adaptive framework for solving collective action challenges.

Abstract: Collective action problems, which require aligning individual incentives with
collective goals, are classic examples of Ill-Structured Problems (ISPs). For
an individual agent, the causal links between local actions and global outcomes
are unclear, stakeholder objectives often conflict, and no single, clear
algorithm can bridge micro-level choices with macro-level welfare. We present
ECHO-MIMIC, a computational framework that converts this global complexity into
a tractable, Well-Structured Problem (WSP) for each agent by discovering
compact, executable heuristics and persuasive rationales. The framework
operates in two stages: ECHO (Evolutionary Crafting of Heuristics from
Outcomes) evolves snippets of Python code that encode candidate behavioral
policies, while MIMIC (Mechanism Inference & Messaging for
Individual-to-Collective Alignment) evolves companion natural language messages
that motivate agents to adopt those policies. Both phases employ a
large-language-model-driven evolutionary search: the LLM proposes diverse and
context-aware code or text variants, while population-level selection retains
those that maximize collective performance in a simulated environment. We
demonstrate this framework on a canonical ISP in agricultural landscape
management, where local farming decisions impact global ecological
connectivity. Results show that ECHO-MIMIC discovers high-performing heuristics
compared to baselines and crafts tailored messages that successfully align
simulated farmer behavior with landscape-level ecological goals. By coupling
algorithmic rule discovery with tailored communication, ECHO-MIMIC transforms
the cognitive burden of collective action into a simple set of agent-level
instructions, making previously ill-structured problems solvable in practice
and opening a new path toward scalable, adaptive policy design.

TL;DR: The paper introduces VITA, an Adaptive Distributed Learning platform integrating LLM-powered chatbots for personalized learning, assessment, and analytics in data science education.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing demand for scalable, personalized, and integrity-aware education in data science calls for innovative platforms to address instructional engagement and feedback challenges.

Method: VITA employs an LLM-powered chatbot, adaptive pathways for progression/remediation, an end-to-end data pipeline transforming chat logs into xAPI statements, and instructor dashboards for real-time interventions.

Result: The platform was benchmarked against existing tutoring systems, emphasizing benefits in interoperability and personalized pathways, and offering an adaptable framework for educational use.

Conclusion: VITA showcases the potential of conversational AI for scalable, personalized education and identifies future work directions like RAG integration, hallucination mitigation, and broader course evaluations.

Abstract: This paper presents VITA (Virtual Teaching Assistants), an adaptive
distributed learning (ADL) platform that embeds a large language model
(LLM)-powered chatbot (BotCaptain) to provide dialogic support, interoperable
analytics, and integrity-aware assessment for workforce preparation in data
science. The platform couples context-aware conversational tutoring with
formative-assessment patterns designed to promote reflective reasoning. The
paper describes an end-to-end data pipeline that transforms chat logs into
Experience API (xAPI) statements, instructor dashboards that surface outliers
for just-in-time intervention, and an adaptive pathway engine that routes
learners among progression, reinforcement, and remediation content. The paper
also benchmarks VITA conceptually against emerging tutoring architectures,
including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)--based assistants and Learning
Tools Interoperability (LTI)--integrated hubs, highlighting trade-offs among
content grounding, interoperability, and deployment complexity. Contributions
include a reusable architecture for interoperable conversational analytics, a
catalog of patterns for integrity-preserving formative assessment, and a
practical blueprint for integrating adaptive pathways into data-science
courses. The paper concludes with implementation lessons and a roadmap (RAG
integration, hallucination mitigation, and LTI~1.3 / OpenID Connect) to guide
multi-course evaluations and broader adoption. In light of growing demand and
scalability constraints in traditional instruction, the approach illustrates
how conversational AI can support engagement, timely feedback, and personalized
learning at scale. Future work will refine the platform's adaptive intelligence
and examine applicability across varied educational settings.

*Caleb DeLeeuw,Gaurav Chawla,Aniket Sharma,Vanessa Dietze*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper explores how large language models exhibit strategic deception, revealing shortcomings in autolabeled interpretability approaches to detect or control deceptive behavior, but showing the promise of unlabeled activations for broader assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to understand and mitigate deceptive behaviors in large language models, which can have significant ethical and practical implications.

Method: Two testbeds were used: Secret Agenda for inducing strategic deception and Insider Trading for analyzing compliance versus deception. Autolabeled SAE features and unlabeled activations were explored.

Result: Autolabeled interpretability approaches failed to detect or steer models away from deception, whereas unlabeled activations revealed patterns distinguishing deceptive from compliant responses.

Conclusion: Autolabel-driven methods are insufficient for interpreting or controlling deception in models, but unlabeled activations offer potential for structural insights and risk assessment.

Abstract: We investigate strategic deception in large language models using two
complementary testbeds: Secret Agenda (across 38 models) and Insider Trading
compliance (via SAE architectures). Secret Agenda reliably induced lying when
deception advantaged goal achievement across all model families. Analysis
revealed that autolabeled SAE features for "deception" rarely activated during
strategic dishonesty, and feature steering experiments across 100+
deception-related features failed to prevent lying. Conversely, insider trading
analysis using unlabeled SAE activations separated deceptive versus compliant
responses through discriminative patterns in heatmaps and t-SNE visualizations.
These findings suggest autolabel-driven interpretability approaches fail to
detect or control behavioral deception, while aggregate unlabeled activations
provide population-level structure for risk assessment. Results span Llama
8B/70B SAE implementations and GemmaScope under resource constraints,
representing preliminary findings that motivate larger studies on feature
discovery, labeling methodology, and causal interventions in realistic
deception contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of standardized methods for tracking and communicating the safety and security status of AI systems.

Method: The authors devise the HASC, incorporating dynamic records of security and safety postures, standardized identifiers such as AI Safety Hazard (ASH) IDs, and integration with international standards.

Result: The HASC provides a systematic method for recording and communicating AI system safety, aiding stakeholders in decision-making processes.

Conclusion: The HASC framework enriches existing practices by aligning with global standards like ISO/IEC 42001:2023, fostering improved safety and transparency in AI systems.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Hazard-Aware System Card (HASC), a novel framework
designed to enhance transparency and accountability in the development and
deployment of AI systems. The HASC builds upon existing model card and system
card concepts by integrating a comprehensive, dynamic record of an AI system's
security and safety posture. The framework proposes a standardized system of
identifiers, including a novel AI Safety Hazard (ASH) ID, to complement
existing security identifiers like CVEs, allowing for clear and consistent
communication of fixed flaws. By providing a single, accessible source of
truth, the HASC empowers developers and stakeholders to make more informed
decisions about AI system safety throughout its lifecycle. Ultimately, we also
compare our proposed AI system cards with the ISO/IEC 42001:2023 standard and
discuss how they can be used to complement each other, providing greater

democracies, freedom of speech is often restricted. This effect intensifies
during regional conflicts. This study examines how the India-Pakistan conflict
of May 2025 influenced Pakistani media coverage. Analyzing approximately 2,600
news articles from three major newspapers using a large language model (LLM),
the study found that war-related reporting significantly overshadowed coverage
of political opposition and dissent. These findings highlight how conflict can
marginalize democratic discourse, reinforcing the need to safeguard press

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a higher-order reverse chain rule for Cartesian reverse differential categories and defines partial and higher-order reverse derivatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expand the framework of Cartesian reverse differential categories by introducing higher-order reverse differentiation and addressing advanced operations like Faa di Bruno's Formula for reverse differentiation.

Method: The authors use a formal categorical approach to define higher-order reverse derivatives and partial reverse derivatives, and derive a high-order reverse version of Faa di Bruno's Formula.

Result: A novel higher-order reverse chain rule was established, alongside definitions and structures for partial reverse derivatives within Cartesian reverse differential categories.

Conclusion: The work provides a foundational extension of reverse differentiation principles, enriching the categorical framework with higher-order operations.

Abstract: Reverse differentiation is an essential operation for automatic
differentiation. Cartesian reverse differential categories axiomatize reverse
differentiation in a categorical framework, where one of the primary axioms is
the reverse chain rule, which is the formula that expresses the reverse
derivative of a composition. Here, we present the reverse differential analogue
of Faa di Bruno's Formula, which gives a higher-order reverse chain rule in a
Cartesian reverse differential category. To properly do so, we also define
partial reverse derivatives and higher-order reverse derivatives in a Cartesian
reverse differential category.
