The sensor is constructed from tiled,\nparameterized microstructures, which allow for tuning the sensor's geometry and\nits mechanical response.

We also present a learned slip detection model that generalizes to\nunseen objects with 95% accuracy, and visuotactile control policies that\nimprove manipulation performance by 40% over vision-only baselines -- achieving\n91% average success rate for four precise tasks that require sub-mm accuracy\nfor successful completion.

To meet these demands, established traditional atlases and\nrecently proposed deep learning-based methods rely on large and comprehensive\ndatasets. This poses a major challenge for studying brains in the presence of\npathologies for which data remains scarce. We address this limitation with\nCINeMA (Conditional Implicit Neural Multi-Modal Atlas), a novel framework for\ncreating high-resolution, spatio-temporal, multimodal brain atlases, suitable\nfor low-data settings.

Furthermore, it enables flexible\nconditioning on anatomical features including GA, birth age, and pathologies\nlike ventriculomegaly (VM) and agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC). CINeMA\nsupports downstream tasks such as tissue segmentation and age prediction\nwhereas its generative properties enable synthetic data creation and\nanatomically informed data augmentation. Surpassing state-of-the-art methods in\naccuracy, efficiency, and versatility, CINeMA represents a powerful tool for\nadvancing brain research.

Recent studies have shown that\nthese models not only generate high-quality images but also encode text-image\nalignment information through attention maps or loss functions. This\ninformation is valuable for various downstream tasks, including segmentation,\ntext-guided image editing, and compositional image generation. However, current\nmethods heavily rely on the assumption of perfect text-image alignment in\ndiffusion models, which is not the case. In this paper, we propose using\nzero-shot referring image segmentation as a proxy task to evaluate the\npixel-level image and class-level text alignment of popular diffusion models.\nWe conduct an in-depth analysis of pixel-text misalignment in diffusion models\nfrom the perspective of training data bias. We find that misalignment occurs in\nimages with small sized, occluded, or rare object classes. Therefore, we\npropose ELBO-T2IAlign, a simple yet effective method to calibrate pixel-text\nalignment in diffusion models based on the evidence lower bound (ELBO) of\nlikelihood. Our method is training-free and generic, eliminating the need to\nidentify the specific cause of misalignment and works well across various\ndiffusion model architectures.

State-of-the-art methods aiming for\nstyle-consistent generation struggle to effectively separate semantic content\nfrom stylistic elements, leading to content leakage from the image provided as\na reference to the targets. To address this challenge, we propose Only-Style: a\nmethod designed to mitigate content leakage in a semantically coherent manner\nwhile preserving stylistic consistency. Only-Style works by localizing content\nleakage during inference, allowing the adaptive tuning of a parameter that\ncontrols the style alignment process, specifically within the image patches\ncontaining the subject in the reference image. This adaptive process best\nbalances stylistic consistency with leakage elimination. Moreover, the\nlocalization of content leakage can function as a standalone component, given a\nreference-target image pair, allowing the adaptive tuning of any\nmethod-specific parameter that provides control over the impact of the\nstylistic reference. In addition, we propose a novel evaluation framework to\nquantify the success of style-consistent generations in avoiding undesired\ncontent leakage.

Multiple\nrounds are played by the agent until the maximum number of rounds is reached.\nPlan data from 11 prostate HDR boost patients (1 for training, and 10 for\ntesting) treated in our clinic were included in this study. The dosimetric\nmetrics and the number of used needles of RL plan were compared to those of the\nclinical results (ground truth). Results: On average, RL plans and clinical\nplans have very similar prostate coverage (Prostate V100) and Rectum D2cc (no\nstatistical significance), while RL plans have less prostate hotspot (Prostate\nV150) and Urethra D20% plans with statistical significance. Moreover, RL plans\nuse 2 less needles than clinical plan on average. Conclusion: We present the\nfirst study demonstrating the feasibility of using reinforcement learning to\nautonomously generate clinically practical HDR prostate brachytherapy plans.\nThis RL-based method achieved equal or improved plan quality compared to\nconventional clinical approaches while requiring fewer needles. With minimal\ndata requirements and strong generalizability, this approach has substantial\npotential to standardize brachytherapy planning, reduce clinical variability,\nand enhance patient outcomes.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper explores using reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize needle placement and dwell times for HDR prostate brachytherapy, enabling faster, consistent, and effective treatment plans.", "motivation": "Current HDR prostate brachytherapy relies heavily on physician experience, leading to potential inconsistencies and longer procedure times. The authors sought to investigate whether RL could standardize the process while maintaining or improving plan quality.", "method": "The authors developed an RL agent to optimize needle positioning and dwell times based on patient anatomy, using a reward function to guide decision-making. The system iteratively adjusted needle settings until an optimal plan was achieved. Data from 11 patients were used for training and testing.", "result": "The RL-generated plans matched or outperformed clinical plans in prostate coverage and rectal sparing while reducing prostate hotspots and urethral doses. Additionally, RL plans used fewer needles compared to clinical plans.", "conclusion": "This study demonstrates that reinforcement learning can autonomously create HDR prostate brachytherapy plans with equal or better quality compared to conventional methods. The method has potential to standardize planning practices, minimize variability, and improve patient care overall."}}
