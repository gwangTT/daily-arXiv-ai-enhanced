Conventional algebraic and iterative\nmethods often rely on specific approximations or boundary conditions that may\nnot be met by many samples or experimental setups. In addition, they require\nmanual tuning of reconstruction parameters by experts, making them less\nadaptable for complex or variable conditions. Here we present a self-learning\napproach for solving the inverse problem of phase retrieval in the near-field\nregime of Fresnel theory using a single intensity measurement (hologram). A\nphysics-informed generative adversarial network is employed to reconstruct both\nthe phase and absorbance of the unpropagated wave field in the sample plane\nfrom a single hologram. Unlike most deep learning approaches for phase\nretrieval, our approach does not require paired, unpaired, or simulated\ntraining data. This significantly broadens the applicability of our approach,\nas acquiring or generating suitable training data remains a major challenge due\nto the wide variability in sample types and experimental configurations. The\nalgorithm demonstrates robust and consistent performance across diverse imaging\nconditions and sample types, delivering quantitative, high-quality\nreconstructions for both simulated data and experimental datasets acquired at\nbeamline P05 at PETRA III (DESY, Hamburg), operated by Helmholtz-Zentrum\nHereon.
