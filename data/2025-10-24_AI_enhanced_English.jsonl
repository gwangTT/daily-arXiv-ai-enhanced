Unlike prompt-based attacks that manipulate textual\ninstructions, environmental injection corrupts an agent's visual perception by\ninserting adversarial UI elements (for example, deceptive overlays or spoofed\nnotifications) directly into the GUI. This bypasses textual safeguards and can\nderail execution, causing privacy leakage, financial loss, or irreversible\ndevice compromise. To systematically evaluate this threat, we introduce\nGhostEI-Bench, the first benchmark for assessing mobile agents under\nenvironmental injection attacks within dynamic, executable environments. Moving\nbeyond static image-based assessments, GhostEI-Bench injects adversarial events\ninto realistic application workflows inside fully operational Android emulators\nand evaluates performance across critical risk scenarios. We further propose a\njudge-LLM protocol that conducts fine-grained failure analysis by reviewing the\nagent's action trajectory alongside the corresponding screenshot sequence,\npinpointing failure in perception, recognition, or reasoning. Comprehensive\nexperiments on state-of-the-art agents reveal pronounced vulnerability to\ndeceptive environmental cues: current models systematically fail to perceive\nand reason about manipulated UIs.
